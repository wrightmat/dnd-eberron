Modular magic items are designed to give players more options, and provide them with items and weapons that can level up with them. The ability slots can give players a gentle introduction to the modularity that is available with certain classes, without overwhelming them. It also provides a way to power up items so players will want to hang on to them for longer.

These items could be described as damaged, where only a master craftsman could restore them to their original glory. Or sentient weapons could be explained as the item consciously allowing more of its potential to be accessed by a stronger wielder. Or more traditional magic items may be powering itself up simply from use.

#### Attunement and Awakening

All modular magic items require traditional attunement in order to use them. While attuned to (but not awakened), a weapon is considered dormant and serves as a standard magical weapon.

In order to use the ability slots on any item or weapon (see below), a player must first awaken it. A weapon is awakened once a critical hit has been made with it. This is an opportunity for the DM to create a scene that explains a player's initial ties to a weapon and how it awakens in a way particular to that player - for example, an ancestral weapon that gives the player a vision of their ancestor passing it on to them.

#### Ability Slots

Each weapon or item has three ability slots, which can hold a single ability at a time. These abilities are represented by transparent pieces of plastic that slot in front of the card, which allow the abilities to be swapped out and leveled up as appropriate.

Under each ability is an ability track with 20 spaces. The ability track is used for unlocking additional slots and levelling up abilities. Once per combat encounter, if an ability is used, a dot should be marked on the ability track for that ability. This should be done at the end of the encounter.

Slot 1 is unlocked when a weapon is awakened (critical hit scored with the weapon). Slot 2 can be unlocked once 10 dots have been filled in on a Slot 1 ability track. Slot 3 can be unlocked once 10 dots have been filled in on a Slot 2 ability track. In other words, slots are unlocked sequentially in order to scale the power of the weapon or item. Once a slot is able to be unlocked, the DM should decide what event must occur in order for it to actually happen. For example, a character may need to single-handedly defeat a significant foe (or other ideas from EGtW are below). This could something simple like scoring a critical hit, or as complicated as an entire adventure arc built around it! When a slot is unlocked, the Level 1 version of the ability is received, represented by a transparent piece of plastic that slots in front of the card.
- A character overcomes one of their greatest fears, bravely facing an otherwise paralyzing phobia to save a fellow party member.
- A character is beaten within an inch of their life by a long-hated foe. In the face of defeat, they feel a deep, dormant strength grow from within.
- A character loses a close ally in battle, their anguish and fury stirring the power within a vestige.
- A character discovers a facet of their destiny that guides them toward a dangerous cause. Setting aside their fears, they accept their fate and responsibility.
- A character successfully takes vengeance against a rival who has long tormented them.
- A character known for restraint gives in to the amoral, violent urges that a vestige was forged to hone.

#### Ability Levels

Each ability has three levels, designed for different tiers of play. Level 1 abilities are designed for character level 5-9, Level 2 abilities are for character level 10-14, and Level 3 abilities are for level 15-20. These can vary depending on your players and your campaign, but serve as a rough guideline.

To unlock Level 2 of an ability, the wielder must meet the minimum level threshold, and make a special DC 30 check (which can be attempted only once per Long Rest). This check is performed by making an attack roll with the weapon, adding the number of dots in the ability track of that ability. To unlock Level 3 of an ability, the wielder must meet the minimum level threshold, and make the same special check, but at DC 40. Players can use any buffs that would be applicable to a normal attack roll to aid in the check. This should encourage your players to work together to level up their abilities.

#### Optional: Alternate Abilities

Some weapons or items may come with alternate abilities for Slots 2 and/or 3. These can be swapped out during a Long Rest to allow customization of weapons to suit different challenges.

To unlock any alternate abilities, make a special DC 35 check (which can be attempted only once per Long Rest). This check is performed by making an attack roll with the weapon, adding the number of dots in the ability track to the result. On a success, the alternate ability is unlocked, represented by a transparent piece of plastic that slots in front of the card (allowing only one ability to be placed in each slot at a time).
