Factions are large forces outside the control of the players. They help create a feeling of a living world.

### Using Factions

Factions generally have a single primary goal they are trying to accomplish, and a list of objectives to compete to order to accomplish that goal. They also have resources and assets that can contribute toward the goal’s completion. Goals may interact with other factions or compete for similar resources. Resources reflect the power and influence of the faction within the world. Each objective requires one to five progress marks to be completed, depending on its complexity.

#### Faction Creation

A given campaign should generally not have more than six active factions at any one time, and three or four are generally more manageable. If there are more extant factions than this in your campaign, then simply run turns for the three or four most active or relevant ones and leave the others fallow for the turn.

To create a faction, first decide whether it is a small, medium, or large faction. A small one might be a petty cult or small free city or minor magical academy. A medium one might be a local baron’s government or province-wide faith. A large one would be an entire kingdom or a major province of a vast empire.

For a small faction, give it four (or 1d4) points to distribute toward each of its resources. For a medium faction, give it six (or 1d6) points; and for a large faction, give it eight (or 1d8) points.

#### Resources

Resources represent the qualities of a faction, and serve as a numerical abstraction of their abilities. These values may be added to certain rolls in a similar way to players' skills.

* **Cunning** (0 to 5): Indicates the faction’s general guile, skill at subterfuge, and subtlety. Low Cunning means the faction is straightforward or unaccustomed to dealing with trickery, while high Cunning is for Machiavellian schemers and secretive organizations.
* **Force** (0 to 5): Reflects the overall military prowess and martial competence of the faction. A faction with low Force isn’t used to using violence to get its way, or is particularly inept at it, while a high Force reflects a culture of military expertise.
* **Magic** (0 to 5): Measures the amount of magical resources available to the faction. A faction with low Magic have at best a few trained mages or small stores of magical goods, while a high Magic reflects a strong focus on wielding magical power, most fitting for a faction that represents a magical order.
* **Wealth** (0 to 5): Shows the faction’s general prosperity, material resources, and facility with money. Low Wealth means the faction is poor, disinterested in material goods, or spendthrift with what they have, while high Wealth factions are rich and familiar with using money and goods as tools for success. Note that this is not a measure of their actual holdings or gold or other measures of currency, and if this is important to your campaign, it should be tracked separately as an asset.

#### Assets

Assets are important resources possessed by a faction, such as controlling a ring of Smugglers, having a unit of Infantry, or physical property such as a headquarters. These are also numerically abstracted, with each asset adding one (or possibly more than one if appropriate) to a faction's Morale.

#### Morale

Morale works for factions much as hit points do for characters; when a faction is reduced to zero morale, it collapses. Its individual members and sub-groups might not all be dead, but they’re so hopelessly disorganized, dispirited, or conflict-bound that the faction ceases to exist as a coherent whole.

Initial Morale is calculated by combining all Resource scores and adding one (or more than one if appropriate) for each Asset held.

A morale check is an optional way for the DM to decide how Factions react during combat encounters and other life threatening situations. Roll 2d6 against the Faction's Morale score. If the roll was equal to or less than the morale score the monster continues combat. If the roll was greater than the monsters morale score the monster would flee or surrender.

### Goal Progression

Between sessions, each faction will work toward their current goal.
