Provided here are some optional rules that can make monsters and combat encounters more engaging, or easier to homebrew

### Roles and Ranks

One of the things that 4th Edition did really well was the inclusion of Roles in combat. Since the beginning of D&D, there have always been some monsters that were better than others at certain things. Goblins have always been sneakier than Orcs, while a Troll was always a hard foe to take down. While these things have always been true, 4th Edition was the first edition to truly codify these monsters and define the Roles that they excel at in combat. These Roles are an excellent thing for DM's to know because it allows for the creation of much more tactical and interesting encounters, by simply throwing a few different Roles together in any given combat.

Monsters may also be modified to take on a different Rank. This may involve weakening them to create minions (sometimes grouping many together to create a unique kind of challenge), or strengthening them to create Leaders or Solo Paragons (potentially turning any monster into a boss-level battle).

These expanded monster rules are entirely optional, and only designed to give some structure to combat where needed. Using monsters of different roles can give a strategic elements to any encounter, and guide the DM in how the monsters should be used. For example, a Brute type monsters might focus on the Barbarian in the players' party, while the Artillery monsters snipes the Fighter from a distance. But if this isn't useful for a particular encounter - just disregard it!

##### Roles
* **Artillery**. Artillery creatures fight best from afar. Whether they wield arrows or magical rays, these creatures always try to keep a distance from their foes.
* **Brute**. Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of hit points and deal lots of damage. They might not be the most disciplined warriors, but they make up for it with sheer toughness and aggression.
* **Controller**. Controllers disorientate their enemies, moving them around the battlefield and applying conditions. Controllers deal little direct damage themselves, preferring to weaken their enemies and allow their allies to attack with advantage.
* **Lurker**. Lurkers hide out of sight until they see a weak point, then attack for massive damage. They are glass cannons, capable of dealing a lot of damage yet easily defeated if cornered.
* **Skirmisher**. Skirmishers are mobile warriors who use hit-and-run tactics in combat. Their traits allow them to make the most of their position.
* **Soldier**. Soldiers are well-armored creatures who draw the attacks of their foes, freeing allies to move around the battlefield. These trained warriors typically have higher attack bonuses and AC.
* **Supporter**. Supporters provide aid to their allies, keeping them in peak condition. Supporters deal little damage and are relatively frail — they need protection to survive long on the battlefield.

##### Ranks
* **Minion**. Minions are weak creatures who find strength in numbers.
* **Standard**. Most monsters are considered Standard by default, if not modified into another Rank.
* **Leader**. A leader is an action-oriented creature who fights alongside underlings.
* **Solo**. A solo creature is an action-oriented creature who can take on the player characters on their own. Some monsters, such as dragons, are Solo by default, and don't take on another Rank.

### Environments

Giving monsters a default environment (or a few) can help determine how they may behave during combat, especially if they're encountered outside of that usual environment. The default environments from the Monster Manual are listed below, along with a few additional/transitional environments from donjon and Flee! Mortals.

Also below are some traits that can be applied to homebrew monsters based on chosen environment. Alternatively, one of the traits could be applied to any monster found in a non-standard environment as a way to make it stand out.

##### Environments
* Arctic
* Cave
* Coastal
* Desert
* Forest
* Grassland
* Hill
* Jungle
* Mountain
* Swamp
* Tomb
* Underground (Underdark)
* Underwater
* Urban

#### Traits and Actions by Environment

##### Arctic

##### Cave
You can create a cave version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- **Hear the Unseen**. At the start of their turn, the cave creature can emit a subsonic trill (no action required). If they aren’t deafened, they can see their surroundings, including invisible and hidden creatures within 200 feet of them who aren’t behind total cover, until the end of their turn.
- **Rockbreaker**. Chitinous claws or blades around the cave creature’s limbs give them a burrowing speed of 30 feet.

##### Coastal


##### Desert


##### Forest
You can create a forest version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- **Speak with Beasts and Plants**. The forest creature can communicate with Beasts and Plants as if they shared a language.
- **Tree Stride**. Once per turn, the forest creature can use 10 feet of their movement to step magically into one living tree within reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be the same size category as the enchanted forest creature or bigger.
- **Living Forest**. A writhing grove thrives in a 30-foot radius centered on the enchanted forest creature. Mist lightly obscures that area, and colorful vines and shifting foliage make its ground difficult terrain. Teasing voices laugh and whisper, giving other creatures in that area disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells and similar effects. Flickering lights extinguish magical darkness in that area created by spells of 3rd level or lower. (When adding this trait to a creature, you can choose to exclude one or more of these effects.)

##### Grassland


##### Hill


##### Jungle


##### Mountain



##### Swamp


##### Tomb
You can create a graveyard or tomb version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- **Armor of Decay**. The tomb creature has resistance to necrotic damage, and immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
- **Touch of Rot**. When the tomb creature hits a target with a melee attack, the attack deals PB extra necrotic damage.
- **Undying Hunger**. The tomb creature can perceive each creature within 30 feet of them who isn’t a Construct or an Undead, as if the tomb creature had blindsight.

##### Underground


##### Underwater


##### Urban
You can create an urban or sewer version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:
- **Low-Light Senses**. The urban creature gains blindsight or darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- Used to Filth. The urban creature gains resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. If the creature already has resistance to poison damage, they gain immunity to poison damage instead.
- Of Unusual Size. If the urban creature is Small or Tiny, their size increases to Medium and their Hit Dice type changes to a d8. This gives them 1 extra hit point per Hit Die if originally Small, or 2 extra hit points per Hit Die if originally Tiny.
