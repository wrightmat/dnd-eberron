### Inebriation

The Inebriation system is based on the Exhaustion system. For every drink equivalent consumed (shot of liquor, glass of wine, pint of ale), make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 plus the number of drinks already imbibed), advancing one level of Inebriation on a failure. Effects of Inebriation are cumulative.

* 1 - Disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception; Advantage against the Frightened condition.
* 2 - Disadvantage on Ability Checks; Speed halved.
* 3 - Disadvantage on Saving Throws; Cannot dash or move more than 10' in the same direction.
* 4 - Disadvantage on Attack Rolls; Damage Resistance.
* 5 - Become Unconscious (pass out, blind drunk).

To cast a spell, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails (but the spell slot is not wasted). A short rest removes one level of Inebriation; a long rest removes all effects of Inebriation.

### Stress

The Stress system is based on the Exhaustion system, changing Exhaustion to only reflect physical stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and adding a new system entirely for Stress. The following changes are made to Exhaustion:
* 1 - Disadvantage on physical* ability checks
* 2 - Speed halved
* 3 - Disadvantage on attack rolls and physical* saving throws
* 4 - Hit point maximum halved
* 5 - Speed reduced to 0
* 6 - Death

A new scale is added for Stress, modifying mental stats (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma):
* 1 - Disadvantage on mental* ability checks
* 2 - Gain one of the following debuffs until stress is reduced to 0 (choose one):
	* Distracted - AC reduced by 2.
	* Headaches - Proficiency bonus not added to ability checks or saving throws.
	* Pessimism - Critical successes are treated as normal rolls.
	* Dread - Always place last on initiative order.
* 3 - Sleep does not heal exhaustion (nightmares) and disadvantage on mental* saving throws
* 4 - Mental* ability scores halved
* 5 - Player experiences hallucinations, hears voices in their head, experiences powerful urges to do things they normally wouldn't, and other mind-altering events.
* 6 - Indefinite Madness Flaw (roll on PHB table)

Some potential causes for Stress include (but are not limited to):
* Entering a battle against a difficult opponent (such as the campaign BBEG)
* Making a critical failure or suffering a critical hit
* Seeing a party member drop to 0 hit points
* Negative social encounters
* Anything that plays to a flaw or goes against a bond or ideal
When a player is in a situation that may cause stress, have them roll a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 plus any stress they may already have by default, or another DC as determined by the DM depending on the situation), with their Stress increasing on a failure. For example, if a player already has 2 levels of Stress and encounters a new stressful situation, then the DC would be 12 for the Wisdom saving throw.

Some ways to remove Stress may include (but aren't limited to):
* Receiving encouragement from members of your party
* Performing an action that adheres to a bond or ideal
* Winning a battle without taking damage
* The *lesser restoration* spell can relieve one level of Stress.
Stress is removed without a check. The DM may also choose for one level of Stress to be removed on a Long Rest.

The idea behind Stress is that it's not just the kind of stress you experience every day when completing a hard task. This is lasting, lingering stress - the kind that makes you doubt yourself, your friends, your ability to complete the quest, and ultimately your concept of how the world works. It has your players answer the question of what their characters do to de-stress, or how they would try to help a party member suffering from stress.

### Swarms

The only core rules for swarms are part of the swarm creature stat blocks and are very basic and boring.
	***Swarm***. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny raven. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

That's all well and good, but in addition to that, use the rules below to make swarms more interesting and more of a challenge. These mechanics incentivize swarms to grow whenever possible.

#### Mechanics

 - When an attack or effect would target a single creature, it effects the entire swarm as if it was a single creature, meaning that it may be able to damage more than one creature in the swarm if it deals enough damage.

 - Instead of tracking each creature in the swarm's health independently, instead keep track of the total damage taken by the swarm. When the damage taken exceeds the health of a single individual, remove one unit from the size of that swarm, and reduce the total by the hit point maximum of a single individual in the swarm.

 - When a swarm makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, add the number of creatures in the swarm to the roll instead of their ordinary modifier. For example, a cloud of steam mephits composed of 7 creatures would have a +7 to hit instead of a +2.

 - A swarm uses the normal attacks and damage that an individual would have access to. Just as above, instead of the normal modifier, add the number of creatures in the swarm to the damage of attacks. Typically, this will be the ability modifier used to make the attack, though some features may add more to this bonus damage. For example, the steam mephit cloud above would do 1d4+7 (9) for their claw attack.
