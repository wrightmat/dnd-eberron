### Summary

* Magic is manipulation of a fundamental particle known as mana (equivalent to a quark, probably). This same mana pervades and animates all life, and originates from the Positive Energy Plane.
* Gods are beings powerful enough to easily manipulate and arrange mana, meaning any creature can become a god given enough time and/or nature ability (such as a natural excess of manachondria). Divine magic derives from manipulation of this already arranged mana (via prayer, generally).
* Arcane magic is manipulation of mana in order to interact with other particles and create effects (spells).
* Psionic magic is manipulation of mana focused in a creature's brain, creating effects focused on the mind.
* Primal magic is manipulation of the life force of various creatures and life forms, all life being different arrangements of mana.
* Wild magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation - essentially accelerating naturally-occurring entropy.

### Details

The source of magic, in Eberron and in other realities of the broader Astral Sea, has been debated by many scholars in many different civilizations. The truth is that all magic is powered by the same energy or force that animates life. When a new lifeform is created, whether in Irian or some other plane of another reality, particles of magic known as mana are gathered from the universe and formed into the new being. When a life is snuffed out, whether by moving through the Gateway of Dolurrh or another means in another reality, the mana used to create that being returns to the universe. No one is certain what the original source of mana is, but it comes from the Positive Energy Plane.

Just as channeling electrons in a controlled manner creates usable electricity, channeling mana in a controlled manner creates magical spells. Spellcasters, regardless of the type, are able to manipulate mana in order to create different effects by interacting them with other particles of the universe. One spellcaster may interact mana with electrons in order to create lightning spells, while another uses mana to excite particles in order to create fire.

While most magic-sensitive creatures have their mana distributed throughout the body, requiring other verbal and somatic components for magical manipulation, others have it concentrated in their mind, allowing for psionic abilities. All of these types of magic arise from the same manipulation of mana.

In some realities, gods have arisen - beings who are able to arrange these particles at will and with little to no effort. This means essentially anyone can become a god if they have either enough natural ability or practiced talent to manipulate sufficient mana. The followers of these gods use a form of magic known as divine magic, which channels this already arranged mana to more easily do work (magical spells).

In a subset of these realities, certain gods may have formed mana more generally in order to create a world with more pervasive magic. One example of this is the Weave and the god Mystra of the Forgotten Realms. Others may have materials that channel mana naturally, such as dragonshards in the Eberron reality. Either way, this arcane magic is able to be channeled by certain spellcasters.

In some realities, select beings are able to channel the mana that forms life itself in order to do work (magical spells), tapping in to what's often called primal magic.

Generally mana is pervasive and relatively equal all over the known universe, and in all planes of reality. But there are a few exceptions where mana groups together or is missing entirely. Dark regions of certain wildspace systems and the general Astral Sea have been discovered, for example the Outer Darkness of Shardspace, or the Dark Regions of the Astral. Some scholars have theorized a sort of inverse mana-like particle that pervades these areas, and have generally taken to calling it "dark mana" or something of the like. Alternatively, rivers of mana are often found in the Astral Sea.

### 13 Types of Magic

Below is an expanded form of magic types that relates to the Eberron concept of the "Baker's Dozen" (13 minus 1). This system takes the original eight schools of magic, adds two types of "magic" that are prevalent in Eberron (Artifice and Psionics), as well as two types of magic that are used in various settings but aren't represented in the schools (Dunamancy from Wildemount and Wild Magic). Finally, it adds the outlawed magic of Hemomancy - blood magic, that particularly draws its power from dragon blood - as the thirteenth (minus one) school.

The table below also associates each type of magic to a classical element (including the expanded concepts of mind, body, spirit, etc.), a color, a plane of Eberron, and a Dean/School of Strixhaven (limited to the ten of those that exist). It also gives each type a little "tag line", for example Dunamancy being the "School of Potentiality and Possibility".

While I don't suggest to add any spells or move any from existing schools, that is something that could be done under this structure.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* I don't totally hate the idea I read on Reddit somewhere of "manachondria", or organelles in magic-sensitive creatures that allow them to interact with mana. May be a little too Star Wars, but I also like the biological basis.
* Anti-mana from the Negative Energy Plane?
