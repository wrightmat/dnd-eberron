### Summary

* Magic is manipulation of a fundamental particle known as mana (equivalent to a quark, probably). This same mana pervades and animates all life, and originates from the Positive Energy Plane.
* Gods are beings powerful enough to easily manipulate and arrange mana, meaning any creature can become a god given enough time and/or nature ability (such as a natural excess of manachondria). Divine magic derives from manipulation of this already arranged mana (via prayer, generally).
* Arcane magic is manipulation of mana in order to interact with other particles and create effects (spells).
* Psionic magic is manipulation of mana focused in a creature's brain, creating effects focused on the mind.
* Primal magic is manipulation of the life force of various creatures and life forms, all life being different arrangements of mana.
* Wild magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation - essentially accelerating naturally-occurring entropy.
* The types are arranged in concentric circles, with the well-known schools of magic on the outer ring, and the letter known schools on the inner ring. The inside of the circles is chaos magic, while the outside of the circles represents order and the material plane. Essentially magic is just tapping into the underlying chaos from before creation.

### Details

The source of magic, in Eberron and in other realities of the broader Astral Sea, has been debated by many scholars in many different civilizations. The truth is that all magic is powered by the same energy or force that animates life. When a new lifeform is created, whether in Irian or some other plane of another reality, particles of magic known as mana are gathered from the universe and formed into the new being. When a life is snuffed out, whether by moving through the Gateway of Dolurrh or another means in another reality, the mana used to create that being returns to the universe. No one is certain what the original source of mana is, but it comes from the Positive Energy Plane.

Just as channeling electrons in a controlled manner creates usable electricity, channeling mana in a controlled manner creates magical spells. Spellcasters, regardless of the type, are able to manipulate mana in order to create different effects by interacting them with other particles of the universe. One spellcaster may interact mana with electrons in order to create lightning spells, while another uses mana to excite particles in order to create fire.

While most magic-sensitive creatures have their mana distributed throughout the body, requiring verbal and somatic components for magical manipulation, others have it concentrated in their mind, allowing for psionic abilities. All of these types of magic arise from the same manipulation of mana.

In some realities, gods have arisen - beings who are able to arrange these particles at will and with little to no effort. This means essentially anyone can become a god if they have either enough natural ability or practiced talent to manipulate sufficient mana. The followers of these gods use a form of magic known as divine magic, which channels this already arranged mana to more easily do work (magical spells).

In a subset of these realities, certain gods may have formed mana more generally in order to create a world with more pervasive magic. One example of this is the Weave and the god Mystra of the Forgotten Realms. Others may have materials that channel mana naturally, such as dragonshards in the Eberron reality. Either way, this arcane magic is able to be channeled by certain spellcasters.

In some realities, select beings are able to channel the mana that forms life itself in order to do work (magical spells), tapping in to what's often called primal magic.

Generally mana is pervasive and relatively equal all over the known universe, and in all planes of reality. But there are a few exceptions where mana groups together or is missing entirely. Dark regions of certain wildspace systems and the general Astral Sea have been discovered, for example the Outer Darkness of Shardspace, or the Dark Regions of the Astral. Some scholars have theorized a sort of inverse mana-like particle that pervades these areas, and have generally taken to calling it "dark mana" or something of the like. Alternatively, rivers of mana are often found in the Astral Sea.

### 13 Types of Magic

Below is an expanded form of magic types that relates to the Eberron concept of the "Baker's Dozen" (13 minus 1). This system takes the original eight schools of magic, adds two types of "magic" that are prevalent in Eberron (Artifice and Psionics), as well as two types of magic that are used in various settings but aren't represented in the schools (Dunamancy from Wildemount and Entropomancy, or Wild Magic). Finally, it adds the outlawed magic of Sangromancy - blood magic, that particularly draws its power from dragon blood - as the thirteenth (minus one) school.

The table below also associates each type of magic to a classical element (including the expanded concepts of mind, body, spirit, etc.), a color, a plane of Eberron, and a Dean/School of Strixhaven (limited to the ten of those that exist). It also gives each type a little "tag line", for example Dunamancy being the "School of Potentiality and Possibility".

While I don't suggest to add any spells or move any from existing schools, that is something that could be done under this structure.

**Outer circle** (schools): Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, Transmutation
**Inner circle**: Artifice, Psionics, Dunamancy
**Center**: Entropomancy
**Hidden**: Sangromancy

### Psionics

It is possible to create a psionic character within the structure of the existing rules by following the steps below (and incorporating a few homebrew feats):
- **Psionic Classes**. Take an existing class that comes with Psionics (such as one of the suggested ones below).
- **Psionic Feats**. A player can willingly take the Psion feat whenever they would take a general feat (or ability score improvement) from their class. They may also take one of the other feats listed below (including two from TCoE).
- **Spell List Switch**. A player character who is already a spellcaster can opt to just replace their classâ€™ spell list with the Psionic Spell list (with GM approval). Doing so grants the player with some incredible Psionic spells, but they may have to sacrifice some of their classâ€™ core spells.

#### Suggested Classes

- Wizard: School subclasses
- Sorcerer: Aberrant Mindâ€‹
- Fighter: Psi Knightâ€‹
- Rogue: Soulknifeâ€‹
- Monk: Psi Bladeâ€‹
- Bard: College of Whispers

#### Feats

##### Psionics
**Prerequisite**: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13+

You awaken to your psionic potential, which enhances your mind and body.
- Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20. Your psionic ability modifier will usually be the highest score of the 3.
- You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is 1d6. You gain one.
- You may completely replace your classâ€™ spell list with the Psionic spell list. When you do so, the spells don't require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost. Because of this, the spells can't be seen being cast, for the purposes of spells such as *counterspell*.

**Psionic Talent Options**. You can use your Psionic Talent die once on each of your turns in the following ways:
- Psi-Boosted Ability. When you make an ability check, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before or after rolling the d20, but before you know whether the check succeeded or failed.
- Psi-Guided Strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack roll, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the attack, potentially causing a miss to hit instead.
- Psi-Shield. Once on each of your turns when a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and subtract the result from the creatures attack roll, potentially causing a hit to miss.
- Psi-Healing. Once on each of your turns, you can roll a Psionic Talent die and heal yourself or another creature by the amount rolled.

**Changing the Dieâ€™s Size**.
- If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is 1d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes 1d4. If itâ€™s 1d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.
- Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on 1d4, the die then becomes 1d6.
- When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

**Psi Replenishment**. As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then canâ€™t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die also resets to its starting size.

##### Telekinetic (TCoE)
**Prerequisite**: Psionics feat

You learn to move things with your mind, granting you the following benefits:
- Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You learn the *[[mage hand]]* cantrip. You can cast it without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand invisible. If you already know this spell, its range increases by 30 feet when you cast it. Its spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
- As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.

##### Telepathic (TCoE)
**Prerequisite**: Psionics feat

You awaken the ability to mentally connect with others, granting you the following benefits:
- Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.
- You can cast the *[[detect thoughts]]* spell, requiring no spell slot or components, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat. If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.

- Building Potential: Whenever you miss an attack, fail a saving throw, or fail an ability check, add one d4 to your Potential Pool (max of your Proficiency Bonus).
- Unleashing Potential: Before rolling an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can spend any number of dice from the Potential Pool to add them to your roll.
- Your Potential Pool resets after a long rest.

##### Chronal Control
**Prerequisite**: Dunamancy feat

You can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Feats

##### Entropomancy

You exist in multiple potential states at once and can tap into them. At the start of your turn, roll a d6 and set it aside as your Flux Die. You can use this die in one of two ways before the start of your next turn:
- Replace a d20 roll you make (attack, ability check, or save) with the Flux Die roll +10.
- Replace an enemy's d20 roll (attack against you or saving throw against your spell) with the Flux Die roll.
Once used, roll a new Flux Die at the start of your next turn.

### Sangromancy

#### Suggested Classes

- Ranger: Blood Hunter (EGtW)
- Wizard: Blood Mage (based on Strixhaven's Blood Mage monster stat block)

#### Feats

##### Sangromancy
**Prerequisite**: Constitution score of 13+

You are able to use your own life essence to channel your magical abilities, granting you the following benefits:
- Whenever your current hit points are below your hit point maximum, you can use your own body as an arcane focus.
- When casting a spell that requires a costly material component, you can forego the component by taking 1d10 necrotic damage per 50 gp of the cost of the component (minimum 1d10). This damage canâ€™t be reduced in any way. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, the spell fails but the spell slot is not expended.
- You can spend hit dice in place of spell slots at a one-to-one ratio. Meaning that you're able to cast a 2nd-level spell without expending a spell slot by expending two hit dice instead. Expended hit dice are no longer available to use for healing during a short rest, and are replenished as usual after a long rest.

##### Internal Fortitude
**Prerequisite**: Sangromancy feat

You gain a greater awareness of the blood flowing through your veins and of the heart that pumps it â€” and some measure of control over both â€” granting you the following benefits:
- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you are subjected to a disease or poison effect that allows a Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a successful save and only half damage on a failed one.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* I don't totally hate the idea I read on Reddit somewhere of "manachondria", or organelles in magic-sensitive creatures that allow them to interact with mana. May be a little too Star Wars, but I also like the biological basis.
* Anti-mana from the Negative Energy Plane?
