Gladiatorial combat is a sport, nay a spectacle, and takes on qualities different from combat in more traditional settings.

Competitors are both warriors and performers, combatants and entertainers. They engage one another in a more artful manner than that of mere brawlers or soldiers, adhering to unwritten rules absent on the field of battle. They create a performance that can be as elegant and nuanced as it is savage and deadly.

Spectators are as much a part of the action as the gladiators themselves: their cheers, boos, accolades, and jeers spurring on their favorites and unnerving the unfavored. Crowds can be fickle, however, thunderous approval giving way to crushing scorn in mere moments.

This phenomenon is represented mechanically as Crowd Favor, a pool of points accumulated by each team of combatants during a gladiatorial contest. These points provide benefits that improve a gladiator’s performance and earn them greater rewards.

##### Earning Crowd Favor

Crowd Favor points are earned through scoring critical hits and by using the performance skill to "Stoke The Crowd".

Anytime you score a critical hit during a gladiatorial contest, you gain 1d6 points of crowd favor. If this critical hit causes an opponent to become bloodied ("First Blood"), you gain 2d6 points of crowd favor instead.

In addition to the standard combat actions (Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Shove), Gladiators may perform the following special action:

**Stoke The Crowd**. As an action, you may encourage fervor in the spectators of your bout. Only one individual per team may use the Stoke The Crowd action each round, but other members of the same team may use the Help action to aid him or her. This check has disadvantage if no member of the opposing team(s) have been dealt damage or been knocked prone by a member of your team since the last use of Stoke The Crowd by your team.

Make a Performance (Charisma) check:
* If the result is 10 – 14, your team gains 1d6 Crowd Favor points.
* If the result is 15 – 19, your team gains 2d6 Crowd Favor points.
* If the result is 20 – 24, your team gains 4d6 Crowd Favor points.
* If the result is 25+, your team gains 6d6 Crowd Favor points.

If you Stoke The Crowd within the reach of an opponent(s) weapon, that opponent may take an attack of opportunity against you. Doing so generally displeases the crowd, resulting in the loss of 1d6 points of Crowd Favor per opportunity attack taken this way (negative crowd favor points are possible).

After all opportunity attacks made this way resolve, you must make a Concentration (Constitution) check vs a DC of 10 or half the total damage you took rounded down (whichever is higher) or forfeit the benefit of your Stoke The Crowd action. If you roll a natural 20 on this concentration check, you regain hit points equal to the concentration check DC and you gain an additional 2d6 points of Crowd Favor as you rebuff the attempt and turn the crowd against the opponents for it.

##### Using Crowd Favor

1) A combatant may revel in the approval of the spectators, spending Crowd Favor points to go beyond their normal limits. A gladiator may choose to gain one of the following as a bonus action:

* Temporary hit points equal to the number of points spent. These temporary hit points are lost at the start of the gladiator’s next turn.
* Increased movement speed in feet equal to the number of points spent (points can only be spent in multiples of 5 this way).
* Additional damage on your next attack this turn., If the attack hits, roll an additional damage die of a size equal to the number of points spent (exactly 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 points must be spent this way).

2) At the end of combat, the victors are showered with coinage from an entertained crowd in proportion with their enjoyment and economic ability.

* Any remaining Crowd Favor points are converted into the equivalent of 1d4 silver coins per unspent crowd favor point (assuming a moderate crowd of mixed middle-class and commoners).
* The die size used and the type of coinage earned this way may be adjusted at GM discretion to account for larger crowds, more affluent spectators, and more prestigious venues/events. For example, a championship bout in the continent’s largest arena before the Empress herself and all of her most wealthy dignitaries might award as much as 1d12 platinum per remaining Crowd Favor point.
