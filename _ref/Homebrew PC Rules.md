#### Introduced

**Potions**. Any potion can be drank or fed to another player as a bonus action. If a healing potion is drank as a full action, the drinking player gains maximum hit points (e.g. 10 HP for a standard potion of healing).

**Cleaving**. When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points. (PHB 272)

**Help Action**. Players can only help on a skill check if they have proficiency in that same skill. Alternatively, players can explain and justify how they're helping with a skill they are proficient in (for example, if a wizard is researching spells and you're a barbarian, you might say you're using Athletics to sprint through the library to collect all the books).

#### Not yet introduced

**Exhaustion**. For every level of exhaustion, you get -1 to any check, saving throw, attack, and spell save DC. At 11 levels of exhaustion, you die. When reduced to 0 HP, you gain one level of exhaustion. Long rests remove 1 level of exhaustion, but comfortable longs rests (inns, ship cabins, etc.) remove 2 levels of exhaustion.
