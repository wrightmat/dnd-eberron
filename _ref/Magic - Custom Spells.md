#### Base Requirements

- Access to a library, just as if the character were researching to learn a spell.
- 1,000 gp expenditure per week
- 1 week per spell level
- Spellcraft check of 10 + level of spell means the character was successful.
	- NB: this check should probably be based on the spell's or spellcaster's spellcasting skill.


#### Spell Points (SP)
- Points are allocated to a spell based on its level, and are used to build the spell effects.
- The points available for building a spell are 1 + twice the spellâ€™s level. Cantrips are considered level 0.
- Additional points are added for each component used in the casting (verbal, somatic, material). Material components with a cost add additional points (see below).

| Material Cost | Additional SP |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 5 gp          | +0.5 SP       |
| 10 gp         | +1 SP         |
| 50 gp         | +1.5 SP       |
| 100 gp        | +2 SP         |
| 500 gp        | +2.5 SP       |
| 1,000 gp      | +3 SP         |
| 5,000 gp      | +3.5 SP       |
| 25,000 gp     | +4 SP         |
