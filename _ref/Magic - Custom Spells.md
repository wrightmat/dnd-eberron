This custom spell system is a compilation of several sources, including 3rd edition, but designed specifically for the magical school setting. Completion of classes are required in order to "unlock" most aspects of spell customization (beyond basic characteristics that don't require spell points), including components, targets, durations, and more.

### Earning Spell Points (SP)

- In order to gain a spell point, a player character must have access to a library, just as if the character were researching to learn a spell. For every week of time spent studying spell creation in this setting, the PC earns one Spell Point.
- Optionally, the DM may require a 1,000 gp expenditure per week of work (per the 3.5e rules).

### Using Spell Points (SP)

- The minimum cost to create any spell is 1 + twice the spell's level (with cantrips considered as level 0 spells).
- Additional points may be gained in the spell creation process by adding things like component requirements and flaws (features considered below the base standard for most spells, as indicated by a positive Spell Point value in the table).
- Points are more often spent in order to add features (as indicated by a negative Spell Point value in the table).
- Spell creation is only possible after completing the course "Beginning Computational Magic" in the first year.

#### Spell Damage



#### Spell Duration and Casting Time



#### Spell Targets, Ranges, and Areas



#### Other Spell Features



#### Finalizing the Spell Creation

- A spellcraft check of 10 + the level of the spell is required in order to complete the spell creation process. This check is based on the spellcaster's class spellcasting skill.
- Note that a spellcaster CANNOT create a spell that would operate only outside of their base class.
