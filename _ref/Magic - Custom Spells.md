This custom spell system is a compilation of several sources, including 3rd edition, but designed specifically for the magical school setting. Completion of classes are required in order to "unlock" most aspects of spell customization (beyond basic characteristics that don't require spell points), including components, targets, durations, and more.

NB: a spellcaster can only create a spell that works and fits within their base class. For example, a wizard should not be creating healing spells, and a cleric shouldn't be creating evocation spells!

### Earning Spell Points (SP)

- In order to gain a spell point, a player character must have access to a library, just as if the character were researching to learn a spell. For every week of time spent studying spell creation in this setting, the PC earns one Spell Point.
- Optionally, the DM may require a 1,000 gp expenditure per week of work (per the 3.5e rules).

### Using Spell Points (SP)

- The minimum cost to create any spell is 1 + twice the spell's level (with cantrips considered as level 0 spells).
- Additional points may be gained in the spell creation process by adding things like component requirements and flaws (features considered below the base standard for most spells, as indicated by a positive Spell Point value in the table).
- Points are more often spent in order to add features (as indicated by a negative Spell Point value in the table).
- Spell creation is only possible after completing the course "Beginning Computational Magic" in the first year.

#### Spell Components

- Each component type must be "unlocked" by completing the appropriate course in the second year - "Linguistics in Spellcasting", "Material Components and Magic", and "Somatic Components and You".
- For Material components, only one Spell Point value should be chosen based on the material cost of the components. If the components are consumed on use, then double the Spell Point value.

| Component (and Material Cost) | Spell Points |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| Verbal                        | +1           |
| Somatic                       | +1           |
| Material, <= 10 gp            | +1 (+2)      |
| Material, <= 100 gp           | +2 (+4)      |
| Material, <= 1,000 gp         | +3 (+6)      |
| Material, <= 10,000 gp        | +4 (+8)      |

#### Spell Damage

- Damage amounts are based on spell level and are not modifiable. Dice values (d6 vs d8) can be freely modified as long as they adhere to the average value in the table.
- Damage types can also be freely modified, save for a few that require points.

| Damage Condition    | Spell Points |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Save halves damage  | 0            |
| Save negates damage | -2           |
| No save required    | -4           |
| Damage type: Force  | -1           |

| Level | One Target, Save Halves Damage | One Target, Save Negates Damage | Multiple Targets, Save Halves Damage | Multiple Targets, Save Negates Damage |

#### Finalizing Spell Creation

- A relevant school of magic, as determined in consultation with the DM, must be assigned to the spell before completion. The ability to assign the spell to a particular school is "unlocked" by completing the "Introduction to School of...." elective(s).
- A spellcraft check of 10 + the level of the spell is required in order to complete the spell creation process.
