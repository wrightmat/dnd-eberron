The Inebriation system is based on the Exhaustion system. For every drink equivalent consumed (shot of liquor, glass of wine, pint of ale), make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 plus the number of drinks already imbibed), advancing one level of Inebriation on a failure. Effects of Inebriation are cumulative.

* 1 - Disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception; Advantage against the Frightened condition.
* 2 - Disadvantage on Ability Checks; Speed halved.
* 3 - Disadvantage on Saving Throws; Cannot dash or move more than 10' in the same direction.
* 4 - Disadvantage on Attack Rolls; Damage Resistance.
* 5 - Become Unconscious (pass out, blind drunk).

To cast a spell, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails (but the spell slot is not wasted). A short rest removes one level of Inebriation; a long rest removes all effects of Inebriation.
