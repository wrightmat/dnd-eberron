### Description and Layout

The Celeste Noir is a sailing ship that can be chartered from Sharn. It's famous for previous exhibitions it's been on, but is now primarily kept on retainer for whatever the Silver Scales may need.

A sailing ship or warship has the following features:
* **Ceilings**. The ceilings in the lower deck, holds, and cabins are 8 feet high with 6-foot-high doorways.
* **Doors**. The ship's doors are made of wood and have AC 15. 18 hit points. and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Footlockers**. Footlockers on the ship are iron and have AC 19, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
* **Light**. Hanging lanterns cast bright light throughout the ship.
* **Rigging**. Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.
* **Sails**. The ship has three 80-foot-tall masts with sails to catch the wind and oars on the lower deck for rowing.

#### 1. Main Deck
The main deck of the ship has the following features:
- **Mangonel**. Sailing ships have one mangonel (DMG, Ch. 8) attached to the deck. Warships have two mangonels. Each weapon has 10 mangonel stones stacked and secured near it.
- **Hatch**. A covered, 10-foot-square opening leads to the lower deck (area W8).
- **Railing**. The main deck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.
- **Rowboats**. Four rowboats are stacked on top of each other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water.

#### 2. Officers' Quarters
Four beds stand in the officer's quarters. Beneath each is an iron footlocker that holds the officers' belongings. The officers sleep in shifts so someone remains on duty to command the crew and carry out the captain's orders.

#### 3. Captain's Quarters
The captain's quarters hold a bed and a desk. Beneath the bed is an iron footlocker that holds the captain's belongings.

#### 4. Siege Weapon Ammunition
Shelves and rope on the walls of this cabin secure mangonel stones and ballista arrows.

#### 5. Supplies
This area holds tools, barrels of tar. rope. extra material to repair sails. and other supplies needed to maintain the ship.

#### 6. Forecastle

- **Ballista**. A ballista (DMG, Ch. 8) is attached to the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.
- **Figurehead**. Warships have an iron figurehead at the front of their forecastle, often shaped to look like a fearsome sea predator. This figurehead serves as the ship's naval ram.
- **Railing**. The forecastle has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.

#### 11. Guest Cabin and Brig
This cabin is meant for guests and visiting high-ranking officials along for the journey. Since warships often have a greater need to house prisoners rather than guests, each bed aboard such a vessel also has a set of manacles (see chapter 5 in the Player's Handbook) attached to its frame.

#### 12. Hold
This area houses both passengers and cargo. The ship's off-duty crew sleep on bedrolls among the crates and barrels of food, water, and other supplies.

### Officers and Crew

Each vessel requires people to run it: the officers in charge and the sailors who follow their orders.

Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew's efforts. Other roles focus on keeping the crew's health and morale in order. The roles are meant to provide a sense of the types of ability checks useful to managing a ship.

A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew's skill, experience, morale. and health are defined by its quality score. This score can affect a number of general ship activities, like the crew's ability to notice threats or contend with hazards. A crew starts with a quality score of +4. but that score varies over time, going as low as -10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties. suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives fair leadership. A typical crew member used the **commoner** stat block.

#### Benjamin Octavius
Benjamin, a chaotic good male human acolyte, is the ship’s surgeon. He’s a student of medicine studying at Morgrave University in Sharn, and is currently on break. He chose to accompany this voyage because he wanted hands-on experience, and this seemed like a thrilling way to get it. The idea of hanging around in a House Jorasco hospital all day drives him mad.

#### Oliver Ramorell
Oliver, a chaotic neutral male human veteran, grew up poor and hungry in the shadows of Rhukaan Draal, capital city of the young, goblin-run nation of Darguun. He fled from Darguun to Sharn as a teenager, but lost his parents in the process. Now he has dedicated himself to the arts of swordsmanship and weapon maintenance, serving as hired muscle for petty criminals in Sharn.

Because of trauma he suffered as a child, Oliver has a paralyzing fear of goblins wielding weapons. Once per turn, when a goblin Oliver can see makes a melee weapon attack against him, he must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, he’s stunned until the end of his next turn.

#### Brunhilde Kheldeburn
Brunhilde, a lawful neutral female dwarf berserker, is a bright and cheerful warrior who transforms into a howling maniac in battle. She hails from the Lhazaar Principalities, and served as a master artillerist aboard a sea baron’s flagship for twenty years. A public disgrace forced her to retire from her naval life, and she left her old life behind to find new work aboard ships and airships in Sharn. Nevertheless, her secret shame doesn’t seem to have dampened her spirits, and she remains a happy-go-lucky ray of sunshine aboard her new and exciting assignment aboard the Celeste Noir.

#### Natsuko Hayashi
Natsuko, a neutral good female human druid. Born to a wealthy family in Sharn, Natsuko fled her life of luxury after she received a barrage of letters threatening her life from an anonymous source. She left Sharn by lightning rail, but her journey was disrupted when its bound elemental power source went out of control. She only survived because of a wandering member of a druid circle who brought her back to her enclave for healing. Over the next fifteen years, Natsuko trained in the Eldeen Reaches as a druid and also plied her family trade as a cartographer, aiding Eldeen druids and Brelish scholars alike.

#### Demetrius d’Lyrandar
Demetrius, a chaotic neutral male half-elf spy, is the peerless but laconic pilot of the Celeste Noir. As a dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar, he is uniquely equipped to pilot this craft. Though anyone could attempt to pilot the ship, their navigations would be halting, childlike, and dangerous compared to the effortless ease granted to Demetrius by his Mark of Storms.

When drunk — which he is most evenings — he may comment that he initially refused to join the crew, but Aubrey showed him a document that instantly changed his mind. If pressed, he immediately backpedals, and pretends to have been joking. If forced to respond, he dismally reveals that Angelica dredged up a record of a murder he committed while exploring the Demon Wastes, several years ago. He murdered his travel partner for a silver idol bearing an inscription of an aberrant dragonmark, which he sold for a tidy profit in Droaam. He escaped from prison, and sought haven in Breland. Such a document would land him right back in prison, probably for life — so he took the job.

Demetrius has resistance to lightning damage, and can cast gust at will, and gust of wind once per day. He also has a swimming speed of 30 feet.

#### Aubrey Galatea
Aubrey, a neutral evil changeling assassin, is the first mate. She possesses an aberrant dragonmark on her back, which spreads from her shoulder blades to her tailbone. She is immensely secretive about the mark, and it grows a fraction of an inch every time she casts a spell using its power — which makes her reluctant to use its power, lest it make its presence more obvious.

If Aubrey joins the characters in combat, she doesn’t use poison on her weapons. She fights as if she were a frontline warrior, rather than revealing her exceptional skill at stealth and assassination. Her aberrant dragonmark also grants her the power to cast friends at will, and can cast charm person once per day.

### Statistics and Combat

![[sailing_ship_stats.png]]

#### Special Officer Actions
During an encounter, the captain, first mate, and bosun each have access to two special action options: Take Aim and Full Speed Ahead, both detailed below.

##### Take Aim
As an action, the captain. first mate, or bosun directs the crew's firing, aiding in aiming one of the ship's weapons. Select one of the ship's weapons that is within 10 feet of the officer. It gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of the ship's next turn.

##### Full Speed Ahead
As an action while on deck, the captain, first mate, or bosun can exhort the crew to work harder and drive the ship forward faster. Roll a d6 and multiply the result by 5. Apply the total as a bonus to the ship's speed until the end of the ship's next turn. If the ship is already benefiting from this action's bonus, don't add the bonuses together; the higher bonus applies.

#### Crew in Combat
Managing a ship's entire crew in combat can prove cumbersome, especially as larger ships often host dozens of sailors. Typically the crew is too busy managing the ship to do anything else during combat. Don't worry about tracking their specific positions unless you want to add that complexity. You can assume that the crew is evenly divided among the upper two decks of a ship.

#### Crew Casualties
Slaying a ship's crew reduces the number of actions most ships can take, making the crew a tempting target in combat. Resolve individual attacks as normal, using the guidelines for resolving many, identical attacks at once from the Dungeon Master's Guide as needed. In the case of spells that cover an area, such as fireball or lightning bolt, you might track the exact location of the spell and crew to determine how many sailors it affects. Alternatively, you can roll 1d6 per level of the spell. The total of the dice is the number of crew members caught in the spell's area.
