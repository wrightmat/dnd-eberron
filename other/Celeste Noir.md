#### Benjamin Octavius
Benjamin, a chaotic good male human acolyte, is the ship’s surgeon. He’s a student of medicine studying at Morgrave University in Sharn, and is currently on break. He chose to accompany this voyage because he wanted hands-on experience, and this seemed like a thrilling way to get it. The idea of hanging around in a House Jorasco hospital all day drives him mad.

#### Oliver Ramorell
Oliver, a chaotic neutral male human veteran, grew up poor and hungry in the shadows of Rhukaan Draal, capital city of the young, goblin-run nation of Darguun. He fled from Darguun to Sharn as a teenager, but lost his parents in the process. Now he has dedicated himself to the arts of swordsmanship and weapon maintenance, serving as hired muscle for petty criminals in Sharn.

Because of trauma he suffered as a child, Oliver has a paralyzing fear of goblins wielding weapons. Once per turn, when a goblin Oliver can see makes a melee weapon attack against him, he must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, he’s stunned until the end of his next turn.

#### Brunhilde Kheldeburn
Brunhilde, a lawful neutral female dwarf berserker, is a bright and cheerful warrior who transforms into a howling maniac in battle. She hails from the Lhazaar Principalities, and served as a master artillerist aboard a sea baron’s flagship for twenty years. A public disgrace forced her to retire from her naval life, and she left her old life behind to find new work aboard ships and airships in Sharn. Nevertheless, her secret shame doesn’t seem to have dampened her spirits, and she remains a happy-go-lucky ray of sunshine aboard her new and exciting assignment aboard the Celeste Noir.

#### Natsuko Hayashi
Natsuko, a neutral good female human druid. Born to a wealthy family in Sharn, Natsuko fled her life of luxury after she received a barrage of letters threatening her life from an anonymous source. She left Sharn by lightning rail, but her journey was disrupted when its bound elemental power source went out of control. She only survived because of a wandering member of a druid circle who brought her back to her enclave for healing. Over the next fifteen years, Natsuko trained in the Eldeen Reaches as a druid and also plied her family trade as a cartographer, aiding Eldeen druids and Brelish scholars alike.

#### Demetrius d’Lyrandar
Demetrius, a chaotic neutral male half-elf spy, is the peerless but laconic pilot of the Celeste Noir. As a dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar, he is uniquely equipped to pilot this craft. Though anyone could attempt to pilot the ship, their navigations would be halting, childlike, and dangerous compared to the effortless ease granted to Demetrius by his Mark of Storms.

When drunk — which he is most evenings — he may comment that he initially refused to join the crew, but Aubrey showed him a document that instantly changed his mind. If pressed, he immediately backpedals, and pretends to have been joking. If forced to respond, he dismally reveals that Angelica dredged up a record of a murder he committed while exploring the Demon Wastes, several years ago. He murdered his travel partner for a silver idol bearing an inscription of an aberrant dragonmark, which he sold for a tidy profit in Droaam. He escaped from prison, and sought haven in Breland. Such a document would land him right back in prison, probably for life — so he took the job.

Demetrius has resistance to lightning damage, and can cast gust at will, and gust of wind once per day. He also has a swimming speed of 30 feet.

#### Aubrey Galatea
Aubrey, a neutral evil changeling assassin, is the first mate. She possesses an aberrant dragonmark on her back, which spreads from her shoulder blades to her tailbone. She is immensely secretive about the mark, and it grows a fraction of an inch every time she casts a spell using its power — which makes her reluctant to use its power, lest it make its presence more obvious.

If Aubrey joins the characters in combat, she doesn’t use poison on her weapons. She fights as if she were a frontline warrior, rather than revealing her exceptional skill at stealth and assassination. Her aberrant dragonmark also grants her the power to cast friends at will, and can cast charm person once per day.
