House Phiarlan is a dragonmarked house known throughout Khorvaire, although they are now based in Sharn, Breland, after their former base of operation in Cyre was destroyed in the Mourning. To the public, Phiarlan is a house of entertainment composed of bards, actors, artists, and acrobats, though in secret it is a house of spies. The public face of House Phiarlan is the Entertainers and Artisans Guild, which manages most of the entertainment industry of Khorvaire, but they also secretly run the Serpentine Table, which collects and sells information.

Recently, a portion of House Phiarlan splintered off to form [[House Thuranni]] in an event known as the Shadow Schism.

"Phiarlan" is an Elven word that translates roughly to spirit keepers.

Instead of having a single headquarters, House Phiarlan has five enclaves known as demesnes that each focus on one of five disciplines of entertainment.

The Phiarlan have a good amount of money thanks to their books, songs, and plays because they have a powerful effect on public opinion. An individual can pay for a Phiarlan author to portray them in a good light or vilify an enemy. Phiarlans are also used as speech writers and many politicians have hired them to improve their image. The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven in Aundair.
* **Demesne of Motion**. As its name suggests, the Demesne of Motion has to do with the art of the body. The art forms studied here are dance, gymnastics, wrestling, mime, contortion, massage, and many more. Phiarlans have mastered many different forms and styles of dance and they are known for their grace and power. Acrobats of the Carnival of Shadows train in this demesne before starting in the Carnival. The Serpentine Table normally take some of the most gifted students of motion for their group. Phiarlan escorts study the arts of motion and shadow. These elves are used for people that need companionship or to make an impression and the Phiarlan can change their appearance through their magic to appear as anyone the client needs or wants. The Demesne of Motion is located in the city of Wroat in Breland.
* **Demesne of Music**. The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of sound, song, and instruments, with different styles from all over Eberron. Most Phiarlan learn at this demesne and it is second in popularity only to the Demesne of Shadow. The Demesne of Music is located in the city of Flamekeep in Thrane.
* **Demesne of Shape**. The Demesne of Shape teaches the different ways of making costumes, sets, props, and instruments. Aesthetic artists, sculptors, painters, and potters also learn at this demesne. The Phiarlans use the skill that they obtained at Aerenal to create many things. The first Demesne of Shape was located in the city of Atur in Karrnath, but it was taken over by the newly founded House Thuranni. House Phiarlan has reestablished the Demesne of Shape in the Thrane city of Thaliost.
* **Demesne of Shadow**. The Demesne of Shadow covers the art of deception. The illusions used in the house's various artforms and plays are learned here. This also serves as the center for verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigned emotion, and role assumption. The Demesne of Shadow is located in Sharn in Breland. The Demense of Shadow was located in Metrol in Cyre, but with Cyre destroyed in the Mourning, the new Demesne of Shadow has been established in Sharn. It is the current home of the house matriarch.
