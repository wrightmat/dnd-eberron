House Lyrandar is a half-elven dragonmarked house operating throughout Khorvaire with its enclave located on Stormhome, an island city-state just north of Aundair.

House Lyrandar possesses the Mark of Storm. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to control winds and waves.

As is common among other dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar is led by a baron (whether a patriarch or matriarch). Some in the house refer to the baron as "Firstborn", believing that Lyran and Selavash, the ancient ancestors of House Lyrandar and the spiritual ancestors of the Khoravar race, speak through that individual.

#### Guilds and Organizations

* Windwrights Guild. One of the largest air and sea shipping and transit businesses in Khorvaire.

Dantian is the second-highest-ranked member of House Lyrandar in Sharn after his aunt, Solia d'Lyrandar. He's a diplomatic person and focuses on advancing Lyrandar's economic and political power. 
* **Ashaya d'Lyrandar** (LN female half-elf sorcerer). Bears a lesser Mark of Storm and the associated magical abilities to control winds, which she has focused on as a dragonmark heir, as well as various sorcerous spells of her own.
* **Gaven d'Lyrandar** (male half-elf fighter). Former member of the house, who was excoriated after being convicted of committing war crimes during the Last War. He was imprisoned in Dreadhold for twenty-six years before he finally escaped with the help of the Aundairian general, Haldren ir'Brassek.
* **Lazrea d'Lyrandar** (CG female half-elf). A notable captain of House Lyrandar based in Stormreach in Xen'drik. A free spirit like many of Lyrandar, Lazrea is famous for her beauty and the joy she takes in challenging any who offend her to a duel.
* **Vennet d'Lyrandar** (male half-elf). Captains the wind galleon *Lightning on Water*. He conducts trade along the route between Sharn and Zarash'ak in the Shadow Marches.
* **Demetrius d'Lyrandar** (CN male half-elf spy). The peerless but laconic pilot of the charter ship *Celeste Noir*. As a dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar, he is uniquely equipped to pilot this craft. Though anyone could attempt to pilot the ship, their navigations would be halting, childlike, and dangerous compared to the effortless ease granted to Demetrius by his Mark of Storms. When drunk — which he is most evenings — he may comment on some of his previous adventures. Demetrius has resistance to lightning damage, and can cast *gust* at will, and *gust of wind* once per day. He also has a swimming speed of 30 feet.
