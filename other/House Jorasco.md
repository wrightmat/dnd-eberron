House Jorasco is a halfling dragonmarked house operating throughout Khorvaire. Although their house enclave is located in Karrnath, their dragonmark originated among the nomadic tribes on the Talenta Plains.

House Jorasco possesses the Mark of Healing. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to heal and cure diseases. This makes Jorasco a vital part of the struggles of the Last War and throughout Khorvaire in general.

#### Guilds

The Healers Guild is the premiere service of House Jorasco. They provide both mundane and magical healing for those who can afford it at their hospitals and healing enclaves throughout Khorvaire. Members of the guild include herbalists, alchemists, physicians, as well as some clerics and adepts of the Sovereign Host and Silver Flame. Few seek healing from the church (even if they are willing to pay) and only the most devout or well respected within a religion will usually receive healing.

### Characters

* **Baron Ulara d'Jorasco** (LG female halfling). The matriarch of House Jorasco and the leader of Resthold, the Healers Guild enclave and training hospital in Vedykar, Karrnath.
* **Ardras d'Jorasco** (NG male halfling). A halfling adept who is particularly devoted to Olladra and a healer of House Jorasco. He lives in a small and isolate hamlet near the edge of the Mournland, helping local farmers with what ails them, their families, or their livestock.
* **Diraz d'Jorasco** (LG non-binary halfling). A member of House Jorasco and a healer in the Deathsgate district of the Middle Tavick's Landing ward in Sharn, Breland.
* **Kurala d'Jorasco** (NG female halfling). Runs Kurala's House of Healing in the Clifftop district of Sharn, Breland. However, she is often called to provide additional service at the Jorasco enclave in Dragon Towers.
* **Janasar** (NN male halfling). The husband of Kurala d'Jorasco, he specializes in veterinary medicine and healing and works at Kurala's House of Healing in the Clifftop district of Sharn, Breland.
* **Mala Boromar d'Jorasco** (NN female halfling). Married to Saidan Boromar, the patriarch of the Boromar Clan, she forms an important tie between the two powerful organizations. For example, Jorasco healers help Boromar halflings for free with the understanding that there will be a return on the investment from Saidan Boromar. Mala and Saidan's eldest daughter is Ilyra Boromar, Sharn city counselor representing Lower Dura.
* **Sahemi the Emissary** (CG male halfling). After the Day of Mourning, Sahemi was sent to help the refugees from Cyre. Helping with this crisis changed him, and he suddenly disappeared into the wilderness of southern Thrane. Two years later, Sahemi reappeared and began preaching the belief that the Mark of Healing can and should be used to not only cure people, but the land as well. He's started teaching young members of House Jorasco druidic magic that he had learned in the Eldeen Reaches. Many elders distrust Sahemi but he is a charismatic speaker and his wide views of what ills the Mark of Healing should be capable of curing make him popular among the younger members of the house. Sahemi wants to cure the Mournland by using the Mark of Healing and an unknown ritual that he is slowly learning in his dreams.
* Jode Jorasco (male halfling). Was an adventuring companion of Daine, Lei d'Cannith, and Pierce.
