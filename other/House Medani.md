House Medani is a half-elven dragonmarked house that is known as the smallest and one of the youngest houses. However, despite its size and age, its members are seemingly everywhere, working as operatives in various fields such as bodyguards, sentries, and inquisitives. Unlike most dragonmarked houses, Medani has a strong geographical location as the majority of its members are Brelish nationals and live in Breland.

House Medani possesses the Mark of Detection. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to detect threats, thus making Medani sentries an invaluable asset to nobles and royal families across Khorvaire.

#### Guilds and Organizations

* **Warning Guild**. Provides a role as the premier counterintelligence agency in the Five Nations. The services and personnel provided by the guild stop threats before they occur and root out its origin. Professional bodyguards, sentries, and Inquisitives are certified by the Warning Guild.
* **Thousand Yard Stare**. A subsidiary of House Medani centered on watching the Mournland and providing advanced warning should anything cross over the border.
* **Basilisk's Gaze**. Commissioned by each of the Five Nations to track down terrorists and war criminals still at large and to bring them to justice. The lists of these criminals are secret codicils that were part of the Treaty of Thronehold. 

### Characters

* **Baron Trelib d'Medani** (NG male half-elf). Current patriarch of House Medani, based in Wroat in Breland. Trelib is a long-time friend of King Boranel. This camaraderie often causes the house to be more open and favorable with Breland than with the other Five Nations.
* Brina d'Medani
* **Taldor d'Medani** (LN male half-elf). High-ranking member of House Medani and the leader of the Basilisk's Gaze guild, whose duty is to hunt war criminals still at large after the Last War.
* **Channara d'Medani** (NN female half-elf). High-ranking member of House Medani and the leader of the Thousand Yard Stare guild.
* **Creilath Movanek** (NN male half-elf bard). Master inquisitive based in Sharn who works for House Medani. He has an half-orc bodyguard named Urzat. As a Medani inquisitive, Creilath is often asked to investigate crimes that the Sharn Watch find mystifying.

### Locations

* **Tower of Inquisition**. Base of operations for House Medani, located in Wroat, Breland.
* **Arythawn Keep**. A fort in southeastern Thrane. It is fairly isolated, separated by the Thornwood from the lightning rail line leading north to Aruldusk, the nearest major town. The Thousand Yard Stare guild is stationed here along with their leader Channara d'Medani, whose objective is to both rebuild the keep and patrol the border with the Mournland.
