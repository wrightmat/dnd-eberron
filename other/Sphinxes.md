There are three types of Sphinxes: Prophetic Sphinxes, Time Traveling Sphinxes, and Story Sphinxes. Story Sphinxes are tied to Thelanis and are primarily agents of Destiny to keep the Book of Destiny's will on track. Time Traveling Sphinxes are tied to Kythri and are agents of the future civilization of Sphinxes that are trying to prevent their civilization from dying at the end of the Third Age of Eberron. Prophetic Sphinxes are tied to Xoriat and the Maze of Reality, and are agents of the Draconic Prophesy.

All of the Sphinxes are concerned about recent events because they advance the Age more quickly than it's supposed to go. The ways in which each group of Sphinxes tried to correct things may be different though.
