 #organization 

Each of the chromatic, metallic, and gem dragon tribes have their own means and methods for advancing the agenda of the dragons, but all of them are committed to it. After the attack on Shae Mordai, the obsidian dragons went underground (literally) to remove any suspicion from themselves, instead convincing the other tribes to take on the mantle. For many years, these tribes have been establishing footholds across Eberron, but especially in Khorvaire.

Below are details on each of the tribes. The dragons should be treated as essentially one large BBEG until near the end of the campaign when the obsidian dragons and Arstyvrax are exposed as the true original bad guys. As the players advance through the campaign, the dragons should be pursuing their own goals as well, regardless of what the players decide to do. A new tract below should be started whenever the PCs first learn about or encounter a dragon tribe plot. At that point, each clock will tick along as the dragons continue their work.

### Progression Tracts

 - [ ]  The Silver Scales are seen delving into forgotten tombs, deciphering ancient texts, and confronting magical challenges, looking for arcane secrets.
