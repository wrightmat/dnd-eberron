House Cannith is a human dragonmarked house whose members are well known for their innovation and advancements in technology. They are responsible for technological wonders such as the warforged and the lightning rail. House Cannith provides repair services and the house's gorgon mark is a known and trusted symbol that appears on magical and mundane items. Through past wars, Cannith have become the most politically powerful dragonmarked house.

House Cannith possesses the Mark of Making. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to infuse items with magic or even repair them, giving Cannith an advantage in the manufacturing arena.

Cannith South is the branch of House Cannith led by Merrix d'Cannith and based out of Breland.

Cannith South is seen by many people as the closest substitute for Whitehearth that the house will ever get. The Cannith of the south send expeditions to Xen'drik to find new artifacts and to the Mournland to regain the lost items and plans of Whitehearth. Cannith South's enclaves are all over Breland, Zilargo, and Darguun. There are rumors that they will seat an enclave in Xen'drik but the house denies these plans. Nevertheless, Merrix has secured an enclave to be built in Stormreach.

The heirs of Cannith South are driven to create new things that that can help Merrix gain control of the house. Members have slowly been adopting veneration of the Traveler, in his artificer aspect. This association with a god of the Dark Six disturbs Cannith West in particular.

Merrix is (I think) second cousin to Jorlanna and third cousin to Zorlan. His father is Aaren and his mother’s name is unknown. He is the youngest of the three.
