This is a map given to a group of adventurers by a wise sphinx known as Tahorep. It clearly depicts several locations where sphinx sightings have been reported, marked by a strange symbol (that looks a bit like an "R"). But this map holds many secrets as well, including additional markings that are invisible to the naked eye and can only be seen with a special artifact.

IRL, this is a map of Khorvaire with several marks in regular pen and even more marks written in an invisible ink pen. At some later point in the game, the party will receive an "artifact" that contains a UV LED which can be activated to allow them to see the additional markings. These should include the remaining sphinx hideouts, marked with the same "R" symbol that represents the sphinx king (although the players won't likely know this for a while), as well as a strange mark over Argonnessen that looks like five spirals. This final strange symbol is actually the symbol of Khyber (Tiamat), marking The Vast under which the topaz dragons reside, but the players won't know this initially.
