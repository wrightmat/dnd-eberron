The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Khorvaire. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals and typically worship the pantheon as a whole rather than the nine deities individually. The Sovereign Host is directly related to the Dark Six, whom the Vassals believe were kicked out of the pantheon for various transgressions in an event referred to as the Schism.

### Core Beliefs

* The Sovereigns are always present. For example, whenever a forge is fired, Onatar stands beside it.
* The Sovereigns shape the world and their hand is in all things. No proof is needed, for the proof is in the world.
* Each Sovereign must be honored at their proper place and time.
* The Sovereigns give strength and guidance to those who listen, and instinct and intuition are their voices. When one is heard most clearly, that one should be followed.

Fundamentally, worshipers of the Host identify them as deities that govern everyday life. Prayer to the Host is contextual: a warrior seeking strength prays to Dol Dorn, while a farmer offers praise to Arawai. While most Vassals claim to wholly reject the Dark Six, some still make offerings to them.

### The Nine Sovereigns

* Arawai, the Sovereign of Life and Love, the patron of fertility. She represents the benign side of nature and brings good weather and bountiful harvests.
* Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Believed to be the first wizard, he revealed the secrets of magic to the world.
* Balinor, the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt, the patron of those who follow the border between nature and civilization. He guides hunters and wild beasts alike.
* Boldrei, the Sovereign of Hall and Hearth. She is guide and protector of family and community and encourages folk to work together for the good of all.
* Dol Arrah, the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice. She represents wisdom in battle and is patron of those who seek justice, fight with honor, and make sacrifices for others.
* Dol Dorn, the Sovereign of Strength and Steel, the patron of the ordinary soldier. He represents bravery, strength, skill at arms, and aids those who wield weapons.
* Kol Korran, the Sovereign of World and Wealth, guide and protector for traders and travelers and supporter of fair negotiation.
* Olladra, the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune, the patron of entertainers, gamblers, and risk-takers. She bestows luck and spreads joy.
* Onatar, the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He inspires all who create and aids artificers, craftsmen, and smiths.

Three powerful totem beasts, all siblings of each other, essentially rule over and protect the creatures of Lamannia.

Bix, the dragon turtle totem, resides in the Endless Ocean and protects all creatures who swim or otherwise roam the waters. He is the representative of Shargon (The Devourer) in the Three Faces of the Wild, and respects creatures who fend for themselves. Anyone who carries favor with Shargon will carry favor with Bix as well.

Strigix, the owl totem, resides in the Twilight Forest and protects all creatures who fly or otherwise roam the skies. She is the representative of Arawai in the Three Faces of the Wild, and protects all life while promoting fertility across the plane. Anyone who carries favor with Arawai will carry favor with Strigix as well.

Ursix, the bear totem, resides in the First Storm and protects all creatures who roam the land. He is the representative of Balinor in the Three Faces of the Wild and embodies nature, and taking what is needed from the bounty of nature.

#### Three Faces of War

Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and Dol Azur (the Mockery)

Followers of the Three Faces of War revere the three Dol Gods as the Sovereigns of War, who are invoked any time blades are drawn or blood is shed in battle. They revere the Dols the most among the Sovereigns, respecting Dol Arrah as the wise face of war, Dol Dorn as the brave face of war, and secretly Dol Azur as the cunning face of war.

The Three Faces of War is a faith for soldiers. The followers of the Three consider all Three Faces of War to be acceptable aspects of warfare. The people of Fernia respect duels over debates so much because of their worship of the Three Faces of War.

The Three Faces of War was first established in Karrnath, and Karrn the Conqueror can be counted among the founders of this warrior cult. It spread to the other Five Nations during the Last War. Today, the Three Faces of War is considered a fraternal organization that has become widespread among soldiers and officers of the armies of Khorvaire. Several officers in the armies of Khorvaire who follow the faith may be acting on behalf of the Shadowsword and his master, the Rage of War.
