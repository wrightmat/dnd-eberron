_Wondrous item, unique_

The _Draakhorn_ is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.

The low, moaning drone of the _Draakhorn_ discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.

While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t knocked prone. The horn can’t be turned or aimed at a specific target.

If five creatures within a 150-foot range of the horn are wearing each of the Dragon Masks, then a special effect occurs when the horn sounds. These five creatures are able to join together as one Gargantuan creature, with the appearance of the Dragon Queen Tiamat herself. Each component functions as the single creature, with each performing an action as a specific part of the dragon's body on their turn.

### DM Notes (temporary)

* Likely body parts: Arms (Claw Attack), Mouth (Breath Weapon and/or Bite), Tail (Tail Attack), Legs (Movement), ???
* Aither is most likely Arms, and her +2 Dragon Claws increase to +3
* Shahiri is most likely the Tail, keeping her Tail reaction
* Thana is most likely the Mouth, with her Bite ability
* Verity being the Legs might make sense, in which case some abilities related to her Rogue-ness should be included.
* Last body part for Staff - what would make sense? The body itself? Keep some spell casting and/or her Chronomancy ability.
