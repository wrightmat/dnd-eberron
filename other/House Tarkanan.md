House Tarkanan is a criminal organization based in Sharn consisting mostly of bearers of aberrant dragonmarks. The House takes its name from Lord Halas Tarkanan who, along with the Lady of the Plague, raised up those with aberrant dragonmarks to challenge the dragonmarked houses during the War of the Mark. House Tarkanan has a reputation for assassination, thievery and other unlawful deeds.

House Tarkanan is not itself a dragonmarked house, but instead, names itself in mockery of the dragonmarked houses that slaughtered their aberrant predecessors in the War of the Mark.

House Tarkanan conducts business to sell assassination and thievery, as well as by recruiting those who have aberrant dragonmarks and teaching them to use their marks as well as how to fight or steal.

Many members of House Tarkanan have adopted Tarkanan as a surname to indicate their allegiance to the house. Senior assassins are known as barons, while more junior members of the house are called lords and ladies.

### Characters

* **Thora Tarkanan** (female human assassin). The founder and leader of House Tarkanan, a criminal gang of aberrant marked individuals in Sharn named in mockery of the dragonmarked houses. She has the ability to sense mystical energies, which she uses to identify other aberrant dragonmark heirs. She uses the name Thora Tavin among the wealthy of Sharn as she cultivates influence in the city.
* **Rotting Bal** (male human monk). Rotting Bal derives his name from the sores that cover his skin, an apparent side effect of his powerful aberrant dragonmark. Bal was born in the Shadow Marches, in a hidden monastery dedicated to the Dragon Below, he learned martial arts at the feet of a dolgaunt master. But he always felt a certain distance from the other monks. The promises of Xoriat felt empty: Bal was driven by different visions. When Thora Tavin came to his monastery, he knew she held the key to his destiny. Bal is utterly devoted to Thora and would give his life to protect her. With his lethal touch, he is one of the deadliest people in Sharn, and he serves House Tarkanan as assassin and enforcer. While he is fanatically devoted to the Tarkanan cause and has no compunctions about killing, he is no fool; he can be reasoned with and would rather avoid unnecessary conflict if possible.
* **Zae** (female halfling rogue). Though she looks like a kindly old halfling lady, she is really a powerful rogue. Zae has the ability to telepathically communicate with and influence rats and other sorts of vermin.
* **Vestan ir'Simul** (male human fighter). A member of the Cult of the Dragon Below, Vestan is a prominent figure within the House. He is adept in the use of a greatsword and has a unique aberrant dragonmark that allows him to cast fear.

### Locations

* **Tavin Manor**. Located in the Central Plateau of Sharn (specifically Dragon Towers), Thora Tarkanan's (formerly Tavin) manor serves as the unofficial base of operations for the House.
