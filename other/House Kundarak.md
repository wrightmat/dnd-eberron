House Kundarak is a dwarven dragonmarked house providing services focused on security and banking. Their primary customers are those who have enough coin to have something worth protecting, namely the wealthy and powerful, other dragonmarked houses, and even state governments. They are the wealthiest dragonmarked house by far and their banking establishments can be found all over Khorvaire.

House Kundarak possesses the Mark of Warding, which allows the bearers to secure items, papers and money, hence why they are the number one provider of security services. A member of their house is always the warden of the Dreadhold prison.

Like all other dragonmarked houses, House Kundarak's business is providing services. Its traditional business is banking, which involves loans and storage. Another service is security; for paying clients, Kundarak will build and install security. Similar to their banking business they offer to store any item in their highly secured vaults.

Kundarak also lease their ancestral lands in Kundarakhold to any mining establishment providing they offer a percentage of the profit.
