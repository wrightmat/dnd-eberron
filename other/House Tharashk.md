House Tharashk is a human and half-orc dragonmarked house that has recently begun spreading throughout Khorvaire, though it is still heavily based in the Shadow Marches. The house is the second youngest of the Dragonmarked houses. Its members are renowned prospectors, bounty hunters, and inquisitives. Tharashk is the only house to hire monstrous laborers and mercenaries from Droaam, with whom they have an alliance.

House Tharashk possesses the Mark of Finding. This mark grants various magical benefits related to locating people and objects which in turn has led to their fame for bounty hunting.

The word "Tharashk" is Orc for "united".

Unlike other dragonmarked houses, Tharashk's clans are incredibly important and they are not as united as their peers. It is uncommon for a Tharashk house member to refer to themselves as "d'Tharashk" and the use of their clan name is more prominent. The three main clans are Aashta, Torrn and Velderan, though these aren't the only clans that make up Tharashk, smaller clans tend to be aligned with one of them. Although the clans do their best to work together for the sake of the house, heirs often put the interests of their clan before the house, which has led to many feuds.

#### Guilds and Organizations

* **Finders Guild**. Oversees the prospecting of dragonshards, bounty-hunting, monster slaying, urban inquisitive services, and locating of precious resources. To avoid major conflicts with House Medani, rather than providing counter-espionage to the rich and powerful, the Finders Guild services the ordinary people.
* **Liondrake's Roar**. New division of House Tharashk created to broker the services of Droaam's monstrous mercenaries. Through it, races that would previously have been killed on sight now find work across the globe. This has led to the normalizing of their presence within society as a whole, much to the Daughters of Sora Kell's approval.
