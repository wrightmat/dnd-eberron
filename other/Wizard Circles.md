#### Arcane Congress (Aundair, Thrane, Breland)
**Headquarters**: Arcanix, Aundair
**Schools**: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.

The Arcane Congress was established by King Galifar I in 15 YK. The Arcane Congress was tasked with studying the mysteries of magic and to place these powers at the service of the Kingdom of Galifar. The Congress has its seat in four floating towers above the village of Arcanix in Aundair. It also uses the Starpeaks Observatory to study the moons and stars. The members of the Congress oversee the towers of wizardry, advise Aundair's monarch on all things magical, and train new wizards and magewrights, despite a friendly rivalry with the wizards of the dragonmarked houses.

#### Arcane Order of Aureon (Thrane)
**Headquarters**: Sigilstar, Thrane
**Schools**: evocation, abjuration, divination

The Arcane Order of Aureon is the largest and most powerful circle in Aundair, wielding influence both within the Arcane Congress and among the nobility of the nation. For this reason it is often disparaged by the other circles, who assert that it has become a hollow shell choosing members based on pedigree rather than arcane talent… essentially, that its members are more likely to be nobles rather than sages. Members of the Arcane Order must swear to use “Aureon’s Gift” to preserve civilization and in the service of the law. While its diverse membership practice all forms of magic, the schools of evocation, abjuration, and divination have especially strong support in the order.

Though not the first wizard’s circle, this was the first circle to use the term _arcane order_. The Arcane Order was founded in ancient Daskaran by monks devoted to Aureon, but quickly spread into Thaliost. Bound by the belief that magic should be a force for law and order, the circle were staunch supporters of Galifar I. They provided magical support during his conquest and helped enforce order across the united kingdom in the aftermath. They formed the solid foundation of the Arcane Congress and ensured the Congress served crown and kingdom. It’s worth noting that the Princess Aundair was originally a member of the Guild of Moonlight and Whispers — and that Aundair herself was instrumental in convincing the other circles to unite in the Arcane Congress, setting aside the feuds many of the lesser circles had with the Arcane Order. Those feuds continue to this day, but are conducted within the confines of the Congress.

Over the course of centuries, internal rivalries caused the Arcane Order to split along national lines. This resulted in Breland’s Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Erudite Order of eastern Cyre. The Arcane Order remained a force in central Cyre and in Thrane, though its support dropped significantly in Thrane following the depredations of Sarmondelaryx, the Year of Blood and Fire, and the rise of the Silver Flame. Today the Arcane Order maintains a single hall in Thrane, in the city of Sigilstar.

#### Arcane Order of Moonlight and Whispers (Aundair)
Headquarters: Daskaran, Aundair
Schools: illusion, enchantment, divination, necromancy

Said to be the first true wizard’s circle in Khorvaire, the Guild of Moonlight and Whispers was founded in ancient Thaliost by Margana Lain. The guild was dedicated to finding ways to replicating the mystical powers of the fey through arcane science. Members specialize in illusion, enchantment, divination, and magic related directly to the fey, and the Guild is an exceptional source of knowledge regarding fey and archfey.

Moonlight isn’t a large circle, in part because of its extremely high standards. However, it is the most widely respected circle in Aundair, in part because Princess Aundair was herself a member of Moonlight and Whispers. While its members are devoted to their nation, they believe that the Arcane Order of Aureon’s obsession with laws and political power undermines the pure pursuit of arcane knowledge. When someone challenges Aureon in the Arcane Congress, it usually takes the support of Moonlight to have a chance to succeed. Breland’s Guild of Starlight and Shadows was founded by members of Moonlight, and the two are generally friendly; while Starlight has less of an interest in the fey, both circles have a common interest in illusion and enchantment. Members of one of these circles will usually be admitted to the halls of the other, though not accorded the privileges of full members.

Mechanically, most members of the circle are wizards, but the guild does accept Archfey warlocks as long as they are proficient in Arcana; the circle is devoted to _understanding_ fey magic, not simply using it.

#### Arcane Order of Starlight and Shadows (Breland)
Headquarters: Sharn, Breland
Schools: conjuration, enchantment, illusion, transmutation

The Order of Starlight and Shadows is a wizards circle in Breland. It originally emerged as a form of rebellion against the strict rules and structure of the Esoteric Order of Aureon. The Order has always included a large number of sorcerers, many of whom found the endless research of the wizards to be dull torment. The Order of Starlight and Shadows has always been a dynamic and energetic organization, willing to bend rules and push boundaries. The circle stood alongside the Esoteric Order to fight the mad wizards of the Closed Circle, but in general the members of the Guild consider the Order wizards to be pretentious stuffed robes. Members of the two circles often quarrel, and mystical duels are not uncommon.

Wizards and sorcerers associated with the Guild of Starlight and Shadows usually focus on spells from the conjuration, enchantment, illusion, and transmutation schools. Specialist wizards who join the Guild must focus on one of these schools.

#### Order of the Ethereal Blade
Headquarters: Lathleer, Aundair
Schools: abjuration, evocation

The Order of the Ethereal Blade was founded in the fifth century (YK) as a duelist’s society, where members of other circles could test their skills and spells in battle with fellow mages. What began as a mystical fight club became the core of the original Knights Arcane, and also pioneered Aundair’s Bladesinger tradition (the Tairnadal, Greensingers, and others have their own forms of this path). Today, the Ethereal Blade focuses on the study and development of war magic, but it remains a dueling society whose members are always ready to prove their mettle in battle. Many of Aundair’s finest warmages are members of the Order, along with officers of the Knights Arcane and Knight Phantoms.

While it began as a wizard’s circle, today the Order of the Ethereal Blade welcomes Eldritch Knights, Arcane Tricksters and others who blend martial and mystical techniques. With that said, it’s still an arcane order. There are other societies that cater purely to duelists and wandslingers, including Fairhaven’s League of ir’Lain and the Darkwood Wands of Passage.

#### Order of the Unspoken Word
Headquarters: Xandrar, Breland
Schools: transmutation

The Unspoken Word is devoted to the pursuit of ultimate arcane power. Members believe that laws and moral concerns should never stand in the way of knowledge. Just as the Guild of Moonlight and Whispers seeks to unlock the mysteries of the fey, the Unspoken Word strives to master the powers of dragons, overlords, and daelkyr. Its members are determined to unravel the secrets of the Du’raskha Tul, the moon-shattering magics of the giants, and more. What has allowed this order to survive when similar groups — such as the Closed Circle of Breland — were destroyed is the absolute insistence that such magic should never be USED: that _these words will forever remain unspoken_. Unspoken mages insist that fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of progress. But an Unspoken wizard pursuing the moon-breaking magic of the giants will insist that they have no desire to shatter moons; it’s simply that _if such powers can be understood, could we use them in positive ways?_

Members of the Unspoken Word are often viewed with a trace of fear, and most enjoy this infamy. They like to imply that they have dreadful secrets locked away in their vaults, fell powers they _could_ unleash if they choose to. But again, they continue to exist because they never _have_ caused disasters… and because their members are mages of considerable skill. While most are wizards, they accept Fiend and Great Old One Warlocks, provided they are proficient in Arcana and devoted to the pursuit of arcane science.

Mordain the Fleshweaver is said to have been part of the Unspoken Word before his fall from grace, though other accounts say that he began as a member but ultimately severed ties with the order in part because he believed such knowledge should be USED. However, the order may still have relics from his time as a member, and it’s possible Mordain still sends them little “gifts” — some of which could be very dangerous.

#### Order of Dolurrh’s Gate
Headquarters: Ghalt, Aundair
Schools: necromancy

Based in Lathleer in Aundair, this is one of the only respected orders of Necromancers in the Five Nations. Members of the order focus on the positive uses of necromancy, such as the practical value of _speak with dead;_ they’re also experts on undead, studying how to contain and control undead threats.

#### Order of the Golden Seal
Headquarters: Fairhaven, Aundair
Schools: adjuration

This order of Abjurers is based in Fairhaven in Aundair. Originally part of the Arcane Order of Aureon, they were split from the main order in 312 YK and charged with maintaining the mystic defenses of the Arcane Congress — and in replicating the abilities of the Mark of Warding. It was wizards of the Golden Seal who first perfected the common _glyph of warding_ spells used in the Five Nations. While small, this is an elite order whose members gained considerable prestige during the Last War.

#### Order of Endless Doors
Headquarters: Passage, Aundair
Schools: conjuration

Based in the city of Passage in Aundair, this guild of Conjurers catalogs manifest zones that can serve as planar portals, along with the circumstances that can open them. They are determined to unlock the secrets of teleportation, and to make this a part of everyday life. They have often feuded with the Guild of Moonlight and Whispers, and some believe that House Orien has sabotaged their research. It’s worth noting that the Guild of Endless Doors did develop the forms of _teleport, teleportation circle_, and _misty step_ currently taught at Arcanix; it’s simply that those first two spells are largely useless because of how few people in the Five Nations can actually cast them, and they are working on developing more accessible forms of this magic. However, they are a lesser order and lack the resources of Orien.

#### Order of the Veil Keepers
Headquarters: Askelios, Thrane (Starpeak Observatory)
Schools: divination

The Keepers are a semi-monastic order, who maintain the Starpeaks Observatory in the mountains close to the village of Askelios. While reclusive, they are respected for their exceptional work with divination; when a Keeper addresses the arcane congress, people listen. This is an excellent option for a Diviner with the hermit background.

#### Order of the Eternal Flame
Headquarters: Thaliost, Thrane
Schools: evocation

Located in the city of Thaliost, this order of Evokers specializes in pyromancy. The Lodge is located on a small manifest zone tied to Fernia, and the “Eternal Flame” is a manifestation of that.

### Order of Oral-un
Headquarters: Wyr, Aundair
Schools: psionics

small monasteries dot the countryside, in which monks devoted to any number of gods or belief systems spend time in quiet mediation and study. The warrior-monks of the Monastery of Oral-un, located on the edge of the village Wyr, for example, are as famed for the sweet, dark Orla-un wine as they are for their doctorine of strong minds and stronger bodies.
