40,000 years ago (Age of Giants), the Turning of the Age was occurring on Dal Quor (from the Dreaming Heart to the Dreaming Dark), and a large number of Quori left the plane and emerged in Xen'drik (due to the large number of manifest zones throughout Xen'drik), seeking refuge.

This led to a war between the Quori and the Giants, who were the primary residents of the continent. The Quori tried to negotiate, but could only do so via the Giants' dreams. The Giants saw this as a form of aggression, and sent their Elf slave soldiers in to the largest manifest zone (now Stormreach) to invade and attack before the Quori could do the same to them.

The Giants, preparing for a retaliatory invasion from the Quori, and not entirely knowing what to expect, designed an automated stone construct that they would use as soldiers in the war. After all, when facing a foe who attacks your dreams, what's better than a soldier that doesn't dream?

Even though the Giants kept the designs secret, the Quori were able to raid the dreams of a few select individuals and obtain the plans for themselves. They then created their own constructs, but using their own shimmering, opalescent sentira rather than stone. And rather than being mindless automatons, these "Quorforged" were piloted each by a Quori bound inside a sphere of sentira known as a Docent. The Quori were now able to attack the Giants on all fronts - night, day, and dream - without threat of harm.

The war raged on, and the Giants adapted their original construct plans to create even larger colossus versions, hoping to turn the tide of the war. But those were developed too late, and the Quori had become too powerful.

So the leaders of the Giants assembled their greatest minds and developed a powerful weapon that became known as Moon Breaker. This eldritch machine was designed to sever the ties of Dal Quor by destroying the moon of Cyra to which the plane was bound. Immediately after the weapon was fired, all of the manifest zones to Dal Quor disappeared, and the Quorfored constructs were disabled (though not destroyed).

Time moved on. The Turning of the Age happened on Dal Quor, despite the previous Quori's best efforts. The elves, who had been used as slave soldiers for years, rose up after the war ended, and the Giants used their eldritch weapon to quell the uprising early by almost wiping out the entire race. Seeing the devastation that the Giants had wrought, and how powerful and reckless they had become, the Dragons of Argonnesson intervened and wiped them out.

### Subgroups

- **Cul'Sir Empire**: Capital at Stormreach, with population spread throughout northern Xen'drik. Composed of Storm and Cloud Giants. Built a thriving society with great infrastructure.
- **Su'lat League**: Population spread throughout western Xen'drik. Composed of Fire Giants. Skilled at elemental binding, transmutation, and abjuration. Build arcane wonders such as Moonbreaker.
- **Group of Eleven**: Alliance of eleven city-states spread all over Xen'drik, each modeled after one of the planes (minus Mabar and Dal Quor).

### Timeline

80,000 years ago (80 KYA)
- The start of the Age of Giants.
- Enslavement of the first Eladrin taken from Shae Tirias Tolai. See [[3-13. Crya, the Lonely Dreamer#Taer Lian Doresh|Taer Lian Doresh]].

60 KYA
- First contact with the dragons, from whom the Giants learned expertise in arcane magic.
- Establishment of other outposts, such as on Sarlona.

40 KYA
- Giant-Quori War
	- Emperor Cul'sir took a special interest in Dal Quor, since it was one of the only planes not claimed by the Group of Eleven.
	- Cul'sir ordered his people to explore any manifest zones to Dal Quor, where they eventually discovered Dream and his immense power. Cul'sir was determined to harness this power and concocted a ritual to draw Dream into the Material Plane and imprison him, eventually being successful.
	- One eladrin woman named Nada, a slave of the giants, took a special interest in their new prisoner. She took care of him as much as she could, and worked on a plan to get him out. Over time, their familiarity blossomed into love.
	- After a hundred years of imprisonment, Nada was finally able to lead a small uprising of the eladrin and drow elves to release Dream and escape Stormreach. Dream was successfully released, but Nada was killed by the giants during the uprising. Dream took her body, and immediately returned to Dal Quor, entombing her body in the spire from which her people originated.
	- Dream's broken heart forced him to bring about the Turning of the Age, ending the Dreaming Heart. He quickly gathered his quori and invaded Xen'drik, hoping to put an end to the Giants who killed his love.
	- The war raged for many years, until the giants built a great arcane weapon known as Moonbreaker to sever the ties between Dal Quor and the Material Realm, closing all manifest zones, and preventing the realms from ever communicating again.
