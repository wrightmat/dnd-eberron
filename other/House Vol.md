House Vol was an elven family line originating in Aerenal and one of the first in which dragonmarks appeared. After that, the family existed for 600 years (approximately −3,200 to −2,600) before it was laid to ruin and completely wiped from the face of Eberron. While the family was a noble house of Aerenal, it was not a formal dragonmarked house as found in modern Khorvaire, as that structure was invented by House Sivis much later.

House Vol possessed the Mark of Death. Erandis Vol's manifestation was unlike any other, theoretically capable of epic feats of magic. However, transformed into an undead lich before she could master its power, Erandis Vol's Mark of Death is powerless.

### History

The line of Vol originated in Xen'drik, and was among the elven clans that rebelled against the giants and followed Aeren in the exodus that led them to their new home, Aerenal, between -39,000 and -38,000. While eventually most of the elves in the continent starting following the Undying Court and their beliefs, tied to the positive influence of Irian, Vol was different: that line had inherited the traditions of the Qabalrin, with darker forms of necromancy tied to the negative influence of Mabar, and a fascination with death that directly opposed the views of most of the other elven factions. One of the well-known members of the line around that period was Ashalyn Vol, a priest and necromancer born around -5,000 who helped established the Mabaran traditions that went down in history and would eventually influence one of the religions of Khorvaire in the current age.

When the line of Vol manifested the Mark of Death (the oldest dragonmark, along with the Mark of Shadow and the Mark of Hospitality), that helped them become more powerful and relevant in their home, but it also created more tensions and fear among their rivals in Aerenal. The dragonmark eventually caused House Vol to be at the center of a historical war between dragons and elves. Minara Vol, the then matriarch of the house, sought to end the long-standing war between the two races through an arcane and genetic project that would fuse the bloodlines of both species. She allied herself with the rogue green dragon, known as the Emerald Claw. Minara was impregnated and gave birth to a girl whom she named Erandis, after her grandmother. The child was raised in secret.

It's not known how but word of the half-dragon child was leaked. Some believe she was betrayed by one of the elves of her very own house, however none of these people can explain exactly who did this or why. The prevailing belief among historians is that her own father, desperate for an end to the devastating conflicts, voluntarily announced the news of the successful breeding of both dragon and elf. If this was truly the Emerald Claw's objective, then he achieved it to some degree as the revelation of Erandis's birth brought an end to the periodic conflicts and an alliance between dragons and elves. But out of mutual fear of the power House Vol could one day possess through these half-dragons, the elves and dragons united with the goal of exterminating the half-dragons and House Vol's bloodline along with it. Not long after the purge began, Erandis's father disappeared. Similar to the mystery of who betrayed Erandis, no one knows what happened to the Emerald Claw, though two theories exist. One is that he perished defending the half-dragons, the other is that he fled Eberron out of shame of his hubris. Towards the end of the war, Erandis was killed. Refusing to accept her death, Minara resurrected her as a lich and had a handful of close allies escort Erandis to Khorvaire.

Though it was a long and bitter war, its results were never in doubt, the line of Vol and every known relative of theirs were exterminated, and their seat, Shae Deseir, devastated, with the red dragon Avothirax personally leading the armies to the location of Minara. House Vol's allies and associates fled for their lives to Khorvaire. Those that fled are believed to be the progenitors to the Blood of Vol religion.
