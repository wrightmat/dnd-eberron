House Vol was an elven family line originating in Aerenal and one of the first in which dragonmarks appeared. After that, the family existed for 600 years (approximately −3,200 to −2,600) before it was laid to ruin and completely wiped from the face of Eberron. While the family was a noble house of Aerenal, it was not a formal dragonmarked house as found in modern Khorvaire, as that structure was invented by House Sivis much later.



### Characters

* **Thora Tarkanan** (female human assassin). The founder and leader of House Tarkanan, a criminal gang of aberrant marked individuals in Sharn named in mockery of the dragonmarked houses. She has the ability to sense mystical energies, which she uses to identify other aberrant dragonmark heirs. She uses the name Thora Tavin among the wealthy of Sharn as she cultivates influence in the city.
* **Rotting Bal** (male human monk). Rotting Bal derives his name from the sores that cover his skin, an apparent side effect of his powerful aberrant dragonmark. Bal was born in the Shadow Marches, in a hidden monastery dedicated to the Dragon Below, he learned martial arts at the feet of a dolgaunt master. But he always felt a certain distance from the other monks. The promises of Xoriat felt empty: Bal was driven by different visions. When Thora Tavin came to his monastery, he knew she held the key to his destiny. Bal is utterly devoted to Thora and would give his life to protect her. With his lethal touch, he is one of the deadliest people in Sharn, and he serves House Tarkanan as assassin and enforcer. While he is fanatically devoted to the Tarkanan cause and has no compunctions about killing, he is no fool; he can be reasoned with and would rather avoid unnecessary conflict if possible.
* **Zae** (female halfling rogue). Though she looks like a kindly old halfling lady, she is really a powerful rogue. Zae has the ability to telepathically communicate with and influence rats and other sorts of vermin.

### Locations

* **Thora's Manor**. Located in Sharn, Thora Tarkanan's manor serves as the unofficial base of operations for the House.
