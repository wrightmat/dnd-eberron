House Cannith is a human dragonmarked house whose members are well known for their innovation and advancements in technology. They are responsible for technological wonders such as the warforged and the lightning rail. House Cannith provides repair services and the house's gorgon mark is a known and trusted symbol that appears on magical and mundane items. Through past wars, Cannith have become the most politically powerful dragonmarked house.

House Cannith possesses the Mark of Making. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to infuse items with magic or even repair them, giving Cannith an advantage in the manufacturing arena.

Cannith West is the branch of House Cannith led by Jorlanna d'Cannith and based out of Fairhaven, Aundair. It has a presence in Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, and strong ties with the other dragonmarked houses through the Twelve. Jorlanna seeks to lead her branch into having stronger ties with the Five Nations and the other dragonmarked houses.

After the death of the previous Cannith patriarch and his heirs on the Day of Mourning, Jorlanna d'Cannith, along with Merrix and Zorlan, each asserted their claim to be the next head of House Cannith. The House could not agree on which one would be the next successor, so the House split into three branches. Cannith West was that led by Jorlanna, and is primarily based in Aundair because Jorlanna's connections to the country.

Some time after the split, Jorlanna used her diplomatic skills to negotiate with the Wardens of the Wood to gain access to sites in the Eldeen Reaches, and get into the good graces of the Twelve.

Jorlanna’s cousin was Aaren, making her second cousin to Merrix (I think), and he’s also second cousin to Zorlan. Her parents are Starrin and Elsabet, so she has the strongest familial claim to the head of the house.
