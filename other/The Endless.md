The Endless are the anthropomorphic representations of powerful natural forces they embody. They regard themselves as a family, referring to each other as siblings, and they are known to be the children of the cosmic entities Entropy ([[Mother Void]]) and Expanse (Father Time).

From oldest to youngest they are: [[Destiny]], [[Death]], [[Dream]], [[Destruction]], [[Desire]], [[Despair]], and [[Delirium]].
