The Silver Scales, also known as the Paladin Protectors of the Realm, are an order of silver dragons and dragonborn headquartered out of Sharn.

The Silver Scales' main headquarters, called the Silvered Spire, is strategically located within the bustling city of Sharn in Breland, within the government district of Highest Towers within the Upper Central Plateau. This allows them to keep a close eye on the activities within Khorvaire and respond swiftly to emerging threats. While physically situated in Breland, the Silver Scales draw inspiration from the principles of Syrania, the plane of tranquility and order. This influence shapes their dedication to protecting the people of Khorvaire from the chaotic machinations of the dragons aligned with Tiamat. Silver dragonborn members of the Silver Scales are known for their intelligence and protective nature. Their training emphasizes not only combat skills but also strategic thinking and diplomacy. The organization actively seeks alliances with other groups in Breland to strengthen their efforts.

The Silver Scales are perceived as a sympathetic force, genuinely dedicated to the well-being of Khorvaire's inhabitants. They engage in public acts of protection, safeguarding cities from external threats. However, behind closed doors, they may have hidden motives or undisclosed plans to counter the chaos spread by the other dragon tribes. The Silver Scales face the challenge of operating within the urban complexity of Sharn while staying true to their principles. They navigate political intricacies and conduct covert operations to counteract the dragons' influence. Maintaining public trust is crucial, but so is ensuring the secrecy of their true mission.

Yllosavax, the venerable silver dragon leading the Silver Scales, maintains a lair within Sharn. From this vantage point, he oversees the operations of the organization and guides its members with his wisdom. Yllosavax holds the key to crucial information about the dragons' plans, making his guidance essential in the fight against Tiamat's release.
