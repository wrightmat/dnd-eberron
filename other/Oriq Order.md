 #organization 

The Oriq is a secret society of mages who use magics "forbidden by the colleges of Strixhaven," and are obsessed with power at any cost.

The Oriq are mostly mages who couldn't pass the entrance exam of Strixhaven or drop-outs. They argue that Strixhaven is controlling access to magic and that the world would be better off without it. If they destroy the university, they believe that anyone anywhere in the world could practice magic and the influence of the Founder Dragons would be negated. The Oriq are usually dressed in dark clothes, with metal masks hovering where their faces should be. One of their most powerful tools are the Mage Hunters, horrifying creatures that can sense magic.

The Oriq reside far from Strixhaven but often infiltrate the university looking for spells and recruits for their dark schemes. Oriq agents use deception, stealth, and their darkly powerful brand of magic in pursuit of their sinister goals.

The Oriq have recently associated with [[House Tarkanan]] of Khorvaire, as they are known aberrant dragonmark bearers. The Dragonmarked House serves as their agents across Khorvaire in the Oriq efforts to siphon magic away from the continent.

### History

The original Oriq were aberrant dragonmark bearers born on Argonnesson, the dragonlords’ stronghold. In the rigid hierarchy of Argonnesson, the aberrant marks were seen as flaws — mutations incompatible with the dragons' vision of order.

These individuals were exiled from Argonnesson for their marks, forming a secretive society dedicated to the study of forbidden magics, including blood magic and chaos magic. The Oriq’s rejection by Argonnesson became the foundation of their philosophy: they sought power outside the rigid traditions enforced by the dragons.

Aberrant dragonmarks became a symbol of the Oriq’s defiance — proof that power lies in the chaos of creation and not in the “perfect” systems of Argonnesson.

### Characters

- **Malakar Draksang** (male dragonborn blood mage). Malakar was a warlock who attended Strixhaven as part of Silverquill College many years ago, but he was passed over for the role of Oracle. He had a special hatred for the Dragonsguard, who had stood in his way, and all the rest of Strixhaven's elite with them. Malakar was all ego, for he believed he was the preeminent mage in the entirety of Eberron. His arrogance was spiked with fits of rage — he was furious that others did not appreciate and recognize his superiority, and he would take it out on anyone who did not show utter deference to him. Malakar practiced all forms of forbidden magic, but was especially drawn toward blood magic, as he strived to awaken the Blood Avatar to demolish Strixhaven University and claim its world-renowned library of spells for himself.
- **Extus Narr** (male human dunamancy warlock). Malakar's first lieutenant, who has been corrupting time and wiping out schools of magic.
- **Zaelith T'Kaarn** (non-gendered githzerai entropomancer). Malakar's second lieutenant, the Herald of Chaos, and a githzerai who came to Strixhaven from Kythri to study and refine chaos magic. Their work led them to experiment with chaotic energies, eventually embracing the school of entropomancy. Their experiments caused a massive explosion, destroying their lab and scattering magical fallout across the region. This event caught Malakar’s attention, and he recruited Zaelith as his second lieutenant, tasking them with sowing chaos and destabilizing the magical infrastructure of Eberron. Their appearance is unsettling: glowing, jagged cracks run across their ashen skin, shifting with an inner light like molten metal, and their silver eyes seem to ripple with chaotic energy. They wear frayed, iridescent robes that constantly shift in color and texture, and their form occasionally flickers, as if caught between dimensions.

### Locations

- **Fortress Badlands**. A secret meeting location on the far south end of campus (between and past Prismari and Witherbloom), several miles from campus.
