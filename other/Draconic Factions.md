 #organization 

Each of the chromatic, metallic, and gem dragon tribes have their own means and methods for advancing the agenda of the dragons, but all of them are committed to it. After the attack on Shae Mordai, the obsidian dragons went underground (literally) to remove any suspicion from themselves, instead convincing the other tribes to take on the mantle. For many years, these tribes have been establishing footholds across Eberron, but especially in Khorvaire.

Below are details on each of the tribes. The dragons should be treated as essentially one large BBEG until near the end of the campaign when the obsidian dragons and Arstyvrax are exposed as the true original bad guys. As the players advance through the campaign, the dragons should be pursuing their own goals as well, regardless of what the players decide to do. A new tract below should be started whenever the PCs first learn about or encounter a dragon tribe plot. At that point, each clock will tick along as the dragons continue their work.

Each of the "Orders" are essentially secret societies where the membership is generally not known. Members do wear a concealed insignia, in case they need to identify each other - a single actual dragon scale from the appropriately colored dragon.

Arstyvrax could use the Ancient Topaz Dragon or Adult Topaz Dragon (depending on desired CR) with the Vampire's additional Bite stuff, Charm action, and Vampire Weaknesses ability.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Some dragon tribes, such as the white dragons (least intelligent and mostly just territorial and ferocious) and the other gem dragons, don't have their own distinct plot progressions.
* Tiamat is essentially a representation of the evil eye, with the sphinxes acting as agents of apotropaic magic.
* For the Infernal Machine, use the Kobold War Machine (CR 9) stat block from Tome of Beasts 2, then have it disappear when defeated (possibly taking a PC with it? maybe roll a save or something?)
* The table below can be used for potions made from dragon parts, draconic ales, or anything else.
