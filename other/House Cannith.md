House Cannith is a human dragonmarked house whose members are well known for their innovation and advancements in technology. They are responsible for technological wonders such as the warforged and the lightning rail. House Cannith provides repair services and the house's gorgon mark is a known and trusted symbol that appears on magical and mundane items. Through past wars, Cannith have become the most politically powerful dragonmarked house.

House Cannith possesses the Mark of Making. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to infuse items with magic or even repair them, giving Cannith an advantage in the manufacturing arena.

### Branches

#### Cannith East (Karrnath)

Cannith East is the branch of House Cannith led by Zorlan d'Cannith and based out of Korth, Karrnath.

Zorlan has done much in Karrnath; where there was once only one outpost of the House, there are now many. Before the Day of Mourning, this branch was known for training house members in administration and diplomacy. Currently, Cannith East maintains expertise in siege warfare and its members advise Karrn generals.

The branch has adopted much of Karnnathi culture. Members of this house think of undead as a necromantic equivalent of warforged. In secret research, Cannith East seeks to create a new kind of undead construct, animated by magic and a ghostly intelligence bound to it.

Zorlan is a devout follower of the Blood of Vol.

He is the furthest removed of the family, being (I think) a second cousin to Jorlanna and a third cousin to Merrix (Jr). His mother was Xerith, and his father’s name is unknown.

#### Cannith South (Breland)

Cannith South is the branch of House Cannith led by Merrix d'Cannith and based out of Sharn, Breland.

Cannith South is seen by many people as the closest substitute for Whitehearth that the house will ever get. The Cannith of the south send expeditions to Xen'drik to find new artifacts and to the Mournland to regain the lost items and plans of Whitehearth. Cannith South's enclaves are all over Breland, Zilargo, and Darguun. There are rumors that they will seat an enclave in Xen'drik but the house denies these plans. Nevertheless, Merrix has secured an enclave to be built in Stormreach.

The heirs of Cannith South are driven to create new things that that can help Merrix gain control of the house. Members have slowly been adopting veneration of the Traveler, in his artificer aspect. This association with a god of the Dark Six disturbs Cannith West in particular.

Merrix is (I think) second cousin to Jorlanna and third cousin to Zorlan. His father is Aaren and his mother’s name is unknown. He is the youngest of the three.

#### Cannith West (Aundair)

Cannith West is the branch of House Cannith led by Jorlanna d'Cannith and based out of Fairhaven, Aundair. It has a presence in Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, and strong ties with the other dragonmarked houses through the Twelve. Jorlanna seeks to lead her branch into having stronger ties with the Five Nations and the other dragonmarked houses.

After the death of the previous Cannith patriarch and his heirs on the Day of Mourning, Jorlanna d'Cannith, along with Merrix and Zorlan, each asserted their claim to be the next head of House Cannith. The House could not agree on which one would be the next successor, so the House split into three branches. Cannith West was that led by Jorlanna, and is primarily based in Aundair because Jorlanna's connections to the country.

Some time after the split, Jorlanna used her diplomatic skills to negotiate with the Wardens of the Wood to gain access to sites in the Eldeen Reaches, and get into the good graces of the Twelve.

Jorlanna’s cousin was Aaren, making her second cousin to Merrix (I think), and he’s also second cousin to Zorlan. Her parents are Starrin and Elsabet, so she has the strongest familial claim to the head of the house.
