_Wondrous item, uncommon_

The jewels and runes in these claws flare with purple light when you enter combat, empowering your natural fists or natural weapons.

While wearing the claws, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with unarmed strikes and natural weapons. Such attacks are considered to be magical.
