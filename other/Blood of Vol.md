The Blood of Vol is an idiosyncratic and decentralized religion that worships the "divinity within" rather than an external higher power. The religion was made the state religion of Karrnath by Kaius I at the start of the Last War, but this status was revoked by Regent Moranna. Worshipers are known as "Seekers", short for "Seekers of the Divinity Within".

### Doctrine

The Blood of Vol believe the following:

* Everyone has a spark of divinity. Find that power within.
* Death is the end, Dolurrh is oblivion, and if the gods exist, they are cruel. Stand with those you care for; all we have is this life and each other.

The core doctrine of the Blood of Vol is that the promises of other faiths are simply lies â€” mortality is a curse inflicted by uncaring gods who jealously hoard immortality and the potential of divinity.

##### Seekers and the Undead
The widespread use of undead by Seekers in both labor roles and the military has caused a great many misconceptions that Seekers worship the undead in some way. In truth, while Seekers do believe that a person's body belongs to their community after death, and intelligent undead hold prominent roles within the faith, the undead are seen as martyrs, not saints. Seekers believe true immortality can only be achieved by the living, and that undeath is but a pale shadow of that. However, undead faith leaders are respected as martyrs for giving up their chance at true immortality to lead others over time.

##### Rites and Prayers
The most important ritual in Seeker communities is the Sacrament of Blood, an irregularly practiced rite that involves each member of the community contributing a small amount of blood by cutting themselves with a bloodfang dagger. After a purification ritual performed by the priest, each member then takes a sip from the chalice to receive a transcendent, revelatory, or even prophetic vision. What many don't know is that leftover blood is stored in barrels of preserving pine to be used in necromantic rituals and to sustain the undead martyrs of the faith.

##### Symbol
As the Blood of Vol is a highly individualized religion, each cleric chooses their own holy symbol. However, symbols related to blood or souls or colored red and black are popular
