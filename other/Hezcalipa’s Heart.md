*Wondrous Item, very rare*

Hezcalipa's Heart is a radiant crystal about the size of a human fist, pulsing with divine energy. It is believed to be the literal heart of the couatl Hezcalipa, a powerful celestial being who once served as a guardian of Eberron.

Any creature who holds the Heart gains 1d12 hit points every minute, or every round while in combat. Once per day, a creature can hold out the Heart and speak Hezcalipa's name, fully healing up to eight creatures of all hit points. Once this has been done, the Heart goes dark until the next dawn, losing all of its benefits.

Hezcalipa was a couatl sage from the Age of Demons who helped discover the Draconic Prophecy and used it to bind the Overlords. Along with the blue dragon Ourelonastrix, Hezcalipa discovered the Draconic Prophecy. Hezcalipa led the couatl in their sacrifice to form the Silver Flame and bind the Overlords during the Age of Demons.[
