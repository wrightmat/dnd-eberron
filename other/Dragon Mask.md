_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

Each _dragon mask_ is a legendary wondrous item that reshapes to fit the face and head of a wearer attuned to it. While you are wearing any _dragon mask_ and attuned to it, you gain the following benefits.

**_Damage Absorption._** You have resistance against the mask's damage type. If you already have resistance to that damage type from another source, you instead have immunity to that damage type.

**_Draconic Majesty._** While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.
