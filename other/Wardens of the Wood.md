The largest and most influential of the druid sects of Khorvaire is the Wardens of the Wood. The Wardens are primarily human but include other races.

During the Last War, the Wardens became the de facto governing body of the Eldeen Reaches after Aundair abandoned the region. The Wardens rallied the people to defend their lands against bandit raiders and foreign nations with designs on their abundant woodlands and plains. The Wardens are respected and well-liked throughout the Eldeen Reaches.

The Wardens seek to maintain a balance between civilization and nature, and is in many ways the most liberal of the druid sects. They have no problem with agriculture or animal husbandry as long as the land and its creatures are not ill-treated or abused. And they often work with farmers and ranchers to help them prosper while maintaining a proper balance with nature.

They guard the plains and forests, protecting nature and the people living there from all threats — natural and unnatural alike. The Great Druid Oalian is recognized as the ultimate authority in the region by all the sects except for the Gatekeepers. The Wardens of the Wood directly serve Oalian and act as his eyes and ears throughout the region.

### Becoming a Warden

The influence of the Wardens is so widespread throughout the Reaches that most inhabitants incorporate the sect’s principles unconsciously in their day-to-day lives. Most are not active worshipers, but druidic gatherings take place right beside village markets and farmers’ fields, and the Eldeen peoples actively engage their more religious neighbors. Thus the environment fosters the qualities most desired for those who wish to serve nature. Those Reachers who live especially close to the land, such as farmers and hunters, participate most actively in the sect’s activities. They attend seasonal ceremonies, pledge their assistance in times of danger, and make offerings of food. Most new members of the Wardens come from these families. During the cycle of spring observances, senior druids visit the villages to speak blessings over the land, while keeping a keen eye out for any who feel the call to nature’s service.

The young hopefuls are taken to the town of Greenheart, the spiritual and administrative center of the Wardens. There they undergo a special ceremony of mass initiation. After being initiated, the youths scatter to various locales within the Reaches to begin their training. Each travels to an area far from his original home, both to broaden experience and to reduce distractions from family and friends.

Initiation into the Wardens takes place in the Great Druid’s grove. The initiates are brought into the presence of Oalian, who speaks to each individually for a moment, then presides over the religious ceremony. Participants wear robes of deep green; at the height of the ceremony they throw back the robes to reveal bright red tunics. This symbolizes the harmony of animal and vegetative life, as well as the initiate’s new awareness of the world. Each initiate then receives a sprig of young bracken in token of her new status. As the fern shoot begins tightly rolled and eventually spreads into a broad frond, so the young initiate will eventually grow to embrace her role within nature.

### Hierarchy

Each community has at least one druid to attend to its religious needs; these priests form loose circles numbering ten to twenty members, representing a wide area. One or two members of each such circle travel to Greenheart for consultation with the elders, although during important festivals all the druids are expected to attend. Larger towns are served by small circles of up to a half-dozen druids. Individual worshipers and circles are self-sufficient and rarely deal with the higher administration of the sect. The hierarchy of the Wardens is fairly loose. However, they do have a fixed base of operation at Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.

Great Druid Oalian heads the order spiritually and still bestows his immense learning on followers, but in his great antiquity he is largely sedentary. He usually dreams in the deep grove but always stirs to welcome visitors. Faena Graymorn (NG female half-elf druid 13) handles the day-to-day management of the sect. She is assisted by a conclave of elder druids whose number varies according to the shifting population of the town: During high conclaves, thousands of worshipers converge on Greenheart, and the temples and other public places require extra personnel to handle the crowds. At other times, six to twelve administrators suffice. They in turn confer with the leaders of various small circles and itinerant members throughout the realm.

### Symbols

The greatpine Oalian is the progenitor of all the Wardens, and many wear a stylized pine tree somewhere on their garb out of respect to the Great Druid. Orcs and half-orcs often bear a scar shaped like a tree.

The bracken fern is another token of the Wardens’ role within the world. Its spreading fronds represent welcome, and its humble status as forest undergrowth emphasizes humility and harmony.
