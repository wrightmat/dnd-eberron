House Ghallanda is a halfling dragonmarked house found throughout Khorvaire. Ghallanda is one of the few dragonmarked houses that are not involved with some form of arms dealing or soldiering; instead, Ghallanda are Eberron's best hosts dealing in food and shelter.

House Ghallanda bears the Mark of Hospitality. This dragonmark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers control over food and shelter, giving Ghallanda an advantage in all areas related to hospitality.

The heraldic symbol of House Ghallanda features a blink dog. The blink dog was chosen as they are known to come to the aid of those in need.

House Ghallanda allow their customers to spend time at their enclaves, much like a hotel. At the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold, Ghallanda secured concessions freeing their enclaves from the local law, effectively turning them into individual nations. Ghallanda holds no quarrel with their customers, so long as they pay. Anyone who is wanted can escape the law by visiting a Ghallanda enclave.

House Ghallanda also runs taverns and inns throughout Khorvaire. Ghallanda also can contribute to war efforts by supplying soldiers with magically created food and shelter.
