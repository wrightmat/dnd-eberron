 [[2-06. The Draconic Soulshard]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Announcement: For healing in the Mournland, I'm not going to reduce it in any way, and we'll just stick with the short rest and long rest changes.
* Announcement: New homebrew rule for Help Actions (if everyone is cool with it - get feedback).
* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.
* If they find the soulshard without fighting the dragon, have Drugor steal it from them (after going the first flashback scene once they touch the shard). Each time they take it back from them, start a new flashback scene.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Went back to Greenland and rested one night. The next day, they were accused of murder.
- Adopted Chip.
