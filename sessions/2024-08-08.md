 [[2-06. The Draconic Soulshard]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Announcement: For healing in the Mournland, I'm not going to reduce it in any way, and we'll just stick with the short rest and long rest changes.
* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.
* If they find the soulshard without fighting the dragon, have Drugor steal it from them (after going the first flashback scene once they touch the shard). Each time they take it back from them, start a new flashback scene.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Went from Barren Keep to Whitehearth, where they got turned around several times, but eventually advanced to Greenland via the wall of mists near Lyrenton.
- At Greenland they had a good conversation with Hammer, Anvil, and Architect, where they got quite a bit of information about the Mournland and the dragon specifically. They also learned all about the Becoming God, and Aither even tithed two gold coins (for the eyes).
- Moved to Field of Ruins, where they didn't really talk to anyone. Went to Making and the Glass Plateau where they had no issue with the Xorn, killing it easily. At Crimson Water, they saw the creature they were warned about at Greenland, and were able to run away from it before it could even attack. At Tronish they just watched the fight and moved on, landing them at the Cavern of Flesh.
- Verity tried to sneak in invisibly, but made enough noise to attract Drugor. They tried to have a conversation, but Drugor was too crazy, especially when Verity convinced him to come outside. The group witnessed him revert to his "Cyran noble" personality. After a while, Drugor went back inside to the sleeping chamber.
- They tried to sneak around and then kind of fight the dragon, but ended up leaving and re-grouping outside. In the process, Aither checked the hoard and didn't find anything, but Verity tried to sense magic in the area and didn't find the exact location, but was pretty certain it was there somewhere. They'll probably try to get the soulshard next time after resting (possibly going back to Greenland for safety).
