[[1-10. Frostfell and Elemaeus]] [[1-08. Lhazaar and Lirmar]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Got away from Frostfell without too much trouble, and made their way to Lhazaar.
* In Regalport, Verity bought a fancy padded garment that gives them advantage on checks against Extreme Cold and Extreme Heat.
* Group is interested in seeing the play "Shadows over Cyre" if they come back to Regalport later.
* Succeeded in navigating the storm, and landed on the island without too much trouble.
* Got through the area without much trouble, and got the Wings of Flying.
* Asked about insignia or some sign that someone is a member of the Sapphire Scales - so definitely look into that insignia idea for all of them because it's great.
