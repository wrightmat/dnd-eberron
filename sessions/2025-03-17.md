### Pre-Session Notes:
* As their last day in class, hand out the leylines map. This was received in any Intro to... course or Beginning Computational Magic (so everyone gets one in-character).
* Start with any year-end downtime and final relationship building. Then we'll move on to summer break scenes, and then start up with Year 2!

### Post-Session Write-Up:
