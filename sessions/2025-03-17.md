session: "6"

### Pre-Session Notes:
* As their last day in class, hand out the magic schools map. This was received in any Intro to... course or Beginning Computational Magic (so everyone gets one in-character).
* Start with any year-end downtime and final relationship building. Then we'll move on to summer break scenes, and then start up with Year 2!
* Alton/Alex: For leaning into blood magic in the future, you should consider Constitution ASI or the Durable feat at 4th level. Blood magic feats won't be available to you until 6th level at the earliest (depending on how things go in-character).

- A few relationship scenes occurred as the year came to a close.
- Summer breaks were spent:
	- Shear: In the Forsaken Forest, looking up at the moon, when he encountered a strange portal to another place where the moon and trees were even bigger and a giant bear acknowledged him as if he knew him (The Twilight Forest of Lamannia, and the bear was Ursix the Totem, but he doesn't know any of that yet).
	- Hawthorne: Back at his inn in Sarlona, where he discovered the first instances of his evocation magic when he inadvertently destroyed a vase.
	- Mina: Stayed at Strixhaven in a private room. Wrote a report back to her handlers, who responded with a passphrase that unlocked the ring that contains her genie.
	- Alton and Cosette: Both stayed at Strixhaven and spent the summer researching in the Biblioplex - Alton studing elemental magic, and Cosette studying abjuration magic. Alton also retrieved the Oriq mask from the buried Murgaxor, but wasn't able to figure out exactly what magic is was emitting.
- The group learned about the Mage Tower game, and decided to enroll a team. They spoke with Professor Sharpbeak, and set off for the Cultivarium. Inside, they tagged the first few mascots without any trouble, but ran into all kinds of trouble in the hydro lab. The water weird grabbed hold of Cosette, and while the other were able to hurt it, it managed to drag her nearly into the water (but a Nat 1 on death saves is what really killed her) and drop her inside the tank. The rest of the party successfully destroyed the tank and the water weird inside of it.
- Alton took Cosett's body and ran off (presumably to revivify her). That's where we ended, so start back with the party split. Hawthorne, Mina, and Shear will presumably continue tagging mascots, while Alton takes Cosett somewhere to be revived.
- TODO: Sent Jolene information about what she learned in her first year courses
