session: "6"

### Pre-Session Notes:
* As their last day in class, hand out the magic schools map. This was received in any Intro to... course or Beginning Computational Magic (so everyone gets one in-character).
* Start with any year-end downtime and final relationship building. Then we'll move on to summer break scenes, and then start up with Year 2!
* Alton/Alex: For leaning into blood magic in the future, you should consider Constitution ASI or the Durable feat at 4th level. Blood magic feats won't be available to you until 6th level at the earliest (depending on how things go in-character).
