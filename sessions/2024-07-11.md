[[2-04. Echoes of the Celestial Realm]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* **Scroll of Teleport**. Verity is Very Familiar with the plane of Syrania, so they can declare where on the plane they're trying to arrive, and I roll a d100 per the table on the spell. On a 25-100, they arrive exactly where they want to. On a 14-24 they arrive in the Immeasureable Market right in front of Miraela's stand. On a 01-13 they arrive directly in front of Verity's father.
	* Aeon is coldly disappointed with Verity. After calling Honor and Joy over, he forbids Verity from ever returning (barring them from the plane), saying something along the lines of: "Listen to me closely, for I will only say this once. This is the plane of peace. You know nothing of peace, and only the opposite follows you. First your mother, now your siblings, and soon those who follow you now. You will leave this place and never return - you are barred from Syrania."
	* Honor and Verity should place their hand on each of Verity's shoulders, thanking them, and then fly away with their father.
* When returning to the ship after Arcanix, have Oliver Ramorell, Quartermaster of the *Celeste Noir* (who's originally from Darguun), directs the party to Darguun. He's heard the group talking about the magic map, and recognized that location. There is an ancient labyrinth there that's is said to hold powerful magic. He'd never believed it before, but it seems now like it must be true!
