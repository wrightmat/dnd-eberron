### Pre-Session Notes

* 

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Went back to Regalport and talked to Ureilya about the Dragon's Path and the Order of the Sapphire Scale, but she didn't know much more since they've been laying low and are secretive.
* Stole a Bag of Holding from Garrick at the Vault in Frostmantle.
* Learned about the Sovereign Host changes, and that Father Beldrok is a member of the Ruby Scale.
* Father Beldrok was converted by a traveling dwarf who told him the ways of Thir, and he came to a realization or revelation, then they established the Order together.
* Successful in the first room. Fought the ooze in the second room. Successful in the other rooms, until the Naga when they took a few bites before getting the red mask off of it.
* Ended at the Mror Holds sphinx lair, as usual.
