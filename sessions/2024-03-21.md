### Pre-Session Notes

* Prior to the players going to Sarlona, Valmoc should leave them, only saying that he has business to attend to, leaving the ship in their care. He's actually going to Arcanix, to advance the silver dragons' goals, but will not tell the players under any circumstances.
* When the players return to Sharn, Valmoc will be there at the dock waiting for them.

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Went back to Regalport and talked to Ureilya about the Dragon's Path and the Order of the Sapphire Scale, but she didn't know much more since they've been laying low and are secretive.
* Stole a Bag of Holding from Garrick at the Vault in Frostmantle.
* Learned about the Sovereign Host changes, and that Father Beldrok is a member of the Ruby Scale.
* Father Beldrok was converted by a traveling dwarf who told him the ways of Thir, and he came to a realization or revelation, then they established the Order together.
* Successful in the first room. Fought the ooze in the second room. 
* TO DO: Need to decide on a member or two, or possibly a changeling lieutenant to Kalryni to serve as the face of the Order of the Sapphire Scale.
* TO DO: Come up with a plan for the theater play and how to use it to drive the story forward.
