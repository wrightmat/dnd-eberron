### Pre-Session Notes

* Prior to the players going to Sarlona, Valmoc should leave them, only saying that he has business to attend to, leaving the ship in their care. He's actually going to Arcanix, to advance the silver dragons' goals, but will not tell the players under any circumstances.
* When the players return to Sharn, Valmoc will be there at the dock waiting for them.
