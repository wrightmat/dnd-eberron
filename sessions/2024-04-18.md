[[2-01. The Storm of Speartip]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* If time left at the end of this session (before moving on to any of the second chapter adventures), it would be a good time to do a first chapter recap and check-in. Make sure everyone understands that the first chapter was designed to set the scene, introduce concepts and characters, and give options - but the second chapter will be way more on the players to determine what happens next. I've given more adventure options, but you'll also want to come up with your own plans for gaining allies, learning more about whatever groups interest you, and eventually taking on the topaz dragons. Also the factions that have been introduced will start pursuing their own goals between your sessions, based on their resource and abilities, and what you all do.

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Maelstrom rounds:
	* Round 1: Lightning Strikes the ship. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 2: Dragon flew overhead. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 3: Wild Magic Fog rolled in. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 4: Necromancy Magical Storm.
	* Round 5: Shadow Fog rolled in.
	* Round 6: Magical Divination Storm for 3 days - disadvantage on crew quality checks.
	* Round 7: Chaos Fleet ship appeared, so ended the maelstrom early
* The party chatted with the Chaos Fleet, and even agreed to their trial to go get Horget Black.
* But when they got to Horget, they heard his story and no long wanted to bring him back to the Chaos Fleet.
* They really connected with the Heavenly Fleet when they appeared, and talked Lorrister out of pursuing Horget after telling him his side of the story. Instead, Lorrister suggested they go talk to Kalryni herself.
* The party loved the palm trees monsters, but they angered one with a bad pursuasion check, so it put up a wall of thorns and attacked. But they managed to break its concentration and run away, and since they never attacked to morphoi, they have no beef with the ravenala.
* When they got to Kalryni, they learned all about her goals, and definitely don't like it. They decided she couldn't really be negotiated with, and instead just took the dragon claws. Almost died from the hoard mimic, but they made it out and returned to the shore.
* Lorrister was a bit confused that they never actually asked Kalryni to end the storm, but they came up with another plan to destroy the artifact on the Chaos Fleet ship and talked Lorrister into helping. That whole encounter turned into a bit of a mexican standoff as they tried to levitate the artifact and push it with mage hand, but Magroth just produced his own mage hand and pushed back. Then Verity flew upward, and Magroth just followed. So after a few rounds, they managed to move the artifact to the Heavenly Fleet ship and eventually destroy it. Magroth's fleet just left through a manifest zone back to Kythri.
* The party made allies with Lorrister and his fleet, but he said he had to remain in the Principalities, so he gave them a Speaking Stone so they can communicate with him in the future.
* Next time they'll sail back to Aerenal for the Moon Temple.
