[[2-02. The Storm of Speartip]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* If time left at the end of this session (before moving on to any of the second chapter adventures), it would be a good time to do a first chapter recap and check-in. Make sure everyone understands that the first chapter was designed to set the scene, introduce concepts and characters, and give options - but the second chapter will be way more on the players to determine what happens next. I've given more adventure options, but you'll also want to come up with your own plans for gaining allies, learning more about whatever groups interest you, and eventually taking on the topaz dragons. Also the factions that have been introduced will start pursuing their own goals between your sessions, based on their resource and abilities, and what you all do.
* Maelstrom rounds: (start with round 4 and the battle next time)
	* Round 1: Lightning Strikes the ship. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 2: Dragon flew overhead. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 3: Wild Magic Fog rolled in. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 4: Necromancy Magical Storm.
