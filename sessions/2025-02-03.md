### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
- Got through the intro sessions, which everyone seemed to like!
- They met Nora, got a quick tour of the central campus, and settled into their dorms. Alton is rooming with Zsehissu, Shear with Hawthorne (although Hawthorne has already expressed interest in getting a new roommate), and Cosset by herself.
- Completed the scavenger hunt and obtained most of the prizes (minus the trinket in the cafe). They had zero issue with the mimic, and learned about the black material covering it but didn't seem to make much of it.
	- Hawthorne has the cuddly mascot.
- Ended with Mavinda congratulating them on a job well done. Start next time with Day 3!
