[[2-02. The Moon Temple]] [[2-03. Mystic Glade and Vvaraak's Cave]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Sara, I added a Lunarian Halberd to your inventory from last time

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Started back at the Moon Temple where they re-traced their steps after 3 weeks IRL to figure out which tiles they were missing. They grabbed the one from the entryway, and then decided to take on the Moonstone Dragon again, finally besting it after about eight rounds. After the battle, they returned to the Possessed Pillar room and levitated the statue in order to grab the tile underneath it. At that point they had no probably arranging the tiles in the correct order, and Thana grabbed the Moonblade.
* They long rested in the cleared temple, and ran into Elyon outside. Aither and Verity initially held back and let Thana handle it, but after a few rounds where they saw how hard Elyon was hitting, they decided to jump in. After that, the combat wasn't much trouble, and Elyon stood done after the last non-lethal blow, talked about how he liked the group and was happy they were protecting his niece, and left.
* The group decided to head to the Shadow Marches next. While on the ship, they learned that Doc Oc had some shore leave while they were gone where he explored the Copper Dragon Hotel and Resort. Valmoc also explained the situation with the magic aura around Arcanix.
* The ship dropped them off in Urthhold, where they talked to dockmaster and chartered a smaller boat to take up the river. They sailed past Zarash'ak without stopping, and into the woods. Thana had very little trouble leading the group in navigating, and they found the Mystic Glade pretty quickly.
* Every member of the party got at least one prophesy while exploring the Glade. They didn't anger (or engage with at all) the Bronzewood trees, and they didn't learn of the healing properties of the brook. They also found the entrance to the ruins pretty quickly, and went inside.
	* Prophesies: 1 (green dragons), 2 (white dragons), 3 (black dragons), 4 (blue dragons), 7 (brass dragons), 10 (gold dragons)
* Verity initially failed to pick the dragon door, so they took the other door. But all of them succumbed to the music effects and ran back outside. So Verity tried again, and succeeded, so they went that way instead. They checked the water tank room first, but didn't let out the mephits. Next the rat room, where they did let out the rats - leading them out they way they came in with rations. Then they continued forward into Meepo's room.
* They loved Meepo - who wouldn't?! They learned about the stolen dragon, and agreed to let Meepo take them to his leader. They had a pleasant conversation with the leader, who directed them to where the dragon was taken and agreed to let Meepo go with them. She also promises a few trinkets from her alter as payment.
* Next time we'll start with the dragon search, from the northeast door out of room 10.
