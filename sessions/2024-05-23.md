[[2-02. The Moon Temple]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Sara, I added a Lunarian Halberd to your inventory from last time
* 

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Thana turned into a bear lycanthrope by rolling a nat one on an Investigation check of the Moon Pool and falling in. She stayed in hybrid form until the first fight with the moonstone dragon, then reverted upon waking up, and had the curse fully removed when they finally got to the cauldron.
* Visited the Library and Monastery of the Moons via the tree doors, and discovered the command word for Fey and Plants in the library.
* Got the key from the statue without it leaving the platform (or attempting to look around the room), so they didn't even see the tile in that room.
* Faced the Moonstone Dragon pretty early on, and it got in its Dream Breath, so I said they woke up in the central chamber (hoping they would explore more).
* They went right this time and killed the Lunarian without too much trouble. Then they went north and faced the dragon again, this time killing it - where I said it burst into a cloud of Dream Breath and they woke up in the central chamber again.
* They explored a bit more, and picked up some of the tiles, while also getting a few more shadow secrets and picking up the Lunarian Halberd (which Aither has).
* Have tiles for Right Crescent, Right Half, Right Gibbous, Left Crescent, Left Half. Start back with the dragon battle again.
