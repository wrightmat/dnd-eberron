[[2-02. The Moon Temple]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Almost two weeks' travel from Lhazaar to Aerenal. During downtime, Benjamin Octavius, the ships' surgeon introduces himself to the party and tells them how he still gets all the news from Sharn via his family who still lives there. Use this moving forward to relay news as needed to the players (instead of using newspapers).
* **News**: Strange unexplainable occurrences (such as magical surges) have been reported first across Lhazaar and then all of eastern Khorvaire.
