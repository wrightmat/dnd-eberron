 [[2-09. Through the Crystal Library]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Now that Chip has his spells and some life experience, would be fun to give him a moment in the library at some point. He could certainly take on the Order of Scribes subclass, and could even obtain his magic quill and/or awakened spellbook in the library somewhere.
* Seralath should also be struggling with his hunger, as he hasn't been able to hunt in quite some time. Should feel uncomfortable while in the library, and continually trying to move everyone through faster so he can get outside. Once the group gets to Vorelâ€™arux, he'd want to excuse himself somehow and try to get away to hunt (but also wanting to do it as steathfully as possible, given all of the other dragons nearby).
* News: The Infernal Engine randomly appeared in Valenar, disappearing 1 day later, and taking 125 people with it.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Thana has a purple tattoo from an Ink Devil's Mark.
- Aither died during the Paper Drake fight. So I moved to her vision early, and had her wake up in the draconic sphere room. Verity was knocked out too, but was able to be healed by Thana. They were beaten by paper!
- The visions were pretty straightforward, with Thana's perception revealing all of the undead, while she delayed for a bit and took damage before getting to the book. She was interested in speaking more to Mee-maw, who made it clear that she was doing well finally at the end (after leaving her handing at the beginning). Verity picked the chaos orb, and eased through the maze with great checks. She rebuked her mother at the end, who disappeared rather than face it.
- Upon reconvening at the draconic sphere, they carefully studied the map. Verity transcribed everything to the map from Flamewind's lair, and Aither downloaded everything to a spellshard. They asked about all of the dragon factions, and also learned the location of the topaz dragons in The Vast. They also learned about their allies appearing on the map as bright shining spots, and discovered that manifest zones are shown on the map as well (due to a roll of 13 by Aither).
- They had no problem with the Repository and its buddies, and found the Lantern of Seeking word for dragons. They also learned the history of the Crystal Library. During the process Aither succumbed to madness but was immune to the frightened condition she received. Thana also fell to madness, and starting trying to attack Verity. So Verity and Aither just ran away further into the sewer, and by four minutes later they were at the end of it.
- The group pushed through the door and found their way to the city of dragons. Thana looked through the gates with a really good check and discovered everything about the city - the dragons, the fountain, and the patrols. Verity explored the sewer more and found the other door where the kobold entered.
- Next time start in the sewers where the party has completed a long rest. Let's see if they get out of the city!
