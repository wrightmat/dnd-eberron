 [[2-09. Through the Crystal Library]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Now that Chip has his spells and some life experience, would be fun to give him a moment in the library at some point. He could certainly take on the Order of Scribes subclass, and could even obtain his magic quill and/or awakened spellbook in the library somewhere.
* Seralath should also be struggling with his hunger, as he hasn't been able to hunt in quite some time. Should feel uncomfortable while in the library, and continually trying to move everyone through faster so he can get outside. Once the group gets to Vorelâ€™arux, he'd want to excuse himself somehow and try to get away to hunt (but also wanting to do it as steathfully as possible, given all of the other dragons nearby).
