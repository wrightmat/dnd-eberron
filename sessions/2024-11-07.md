 [[2-10. Traversing Argonnessen]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* News: The Infernal Engine randomly appeared in Valenar, disappearing 1 day later, and taking 125 people with it.
* Long rest. During which they discover that Seralath has gone missing.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Spiney managed to fly away with the Heart in tow, headed south (toward Argonnessen, but they don't necessarily know that).
- They ran to the airship ready to chase after Spiney. So prep some airship chase rules!
- Might look into the Emerald Scale, primarily for information gathering, but also maybe getting Arcanix on their side.
- Maybe interested in doing more with the Silver Flame.
