[[1-08. Aerenal and Aelion]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start at Morgrave University, where the players hear a commotion outside of Flamewind's office. If they go outside, there are three White Dragon Wyrmlings, covering each of the three hallways away from the office. They will attack if they see a player, first using their Cold Breath at range.
`encounter: 3: White Dragon Wyrmling`
* When the players make it out of Lareth Hall, Valmoc is outside, beckoning for them to follow him. He leads them safely to the docks, where he has a chartered ship waiting for them.
* On the way to Aerenal, he continues to try and convince the party that he's on their side.
