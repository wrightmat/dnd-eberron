[[1-05. Aerenal and Aelion]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start at Morgrave University, where the players hear a commotion outside of Flamewind's office. If they go outside, there are three White Dragon Wyrmlings, covering each of the three hallways away from the office. They will attack if they see a player, first using their Cold Breath at range.
`encounter: 3: White Dragon Wyrmling`
* When the players make it out of Lareth Hall, Valmoc is outside, beckoning for them to follow him. He leads them safely to the docks, where he has a chartered ship waiting for them.
* On the way to Aerenal, he continues to try and convince the party that he's on their side.

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Had a bit of a hard time with the white wyrmling fight, so Valmoc stepped in and used his paralyzing breath on one of them. Then afterward, it was revealed that Flamewind was the one who hired him, and the group immediately seemed more trusting of the situation. They got on the chartered ship with him and headed to Aerenal.
* When they got to Shae Cairadal, Thana saw her uncle and had a conversation, which went basically as expected. She agreed to immediately leave town and go investigate the Madwood. Verity bought another set of Thieves' Tools before leaving.
* Thana recognized Aeren with a really good history check, and Verity quickly deciphered the glyphs to get inside. With the group already knowing Aeren, they didn't have much trouble with the arrangement of the spirits (but had a good time with it).
* Then they ALL ROLLED NAT 1s IN A ROW! Four Nat 1s! While trying to decipher what was going on with the glowing orbs. So I threw the monster encounter at them, and then let them repeat the checks, where they finally succeeded.
* Ended at the Grove of Spirits in Aelion's lair.
