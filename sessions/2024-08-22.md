### Pre-Session Notes

* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.
* After they get caught up with everyone on the ship, it's attacked by topaz dragons, led by Arstyvrax. Start by rolling initiative, with all of the dragons acting on a single initiative (and Arstyvrax only using legendary actions).
	* Round 1: Each topaz dragon breathes their desiccating breath on to the ship. Everyone on the ship must make the Constitution save.
	* Round 2: Each topaz dragon flies over the ship, doing impressive aerial maneuvers (casting *bane*). Everyone on the ship must make the Charisma save. Everyone can also make a DC 15 Perception check (using Thana's passive if no one succeeds), with any successes revealing that Arstyvrax is flying overhead, eying the ship, and heading straight toward it.
	* Round 3: Arstyvrax flies directly over the ship, casting *control water* (Flood), causing a wave to crest over the ship. DC 16 Dexterity save to avoid 4d8 bludgeoning damage.
	* Round 4: Arstyvrax flies back over the ship, casting *control water* (Part Water), causing the water to part directly below him as he flies over. The ship falls to the ocean floor, and the water washes back over it as the spell ends. 
	* This ship is destroyed, and the players land in the water. Start by having each of them roll 2d20 (staying in initiative order), using these rolls to place their mini on the grid, with the first one being on the long axis and the second one on the short axis (for the long axis, which is 22 squares long, ignore the last one on each end; for the short axis, which is 16 squares long, have 2 and 19 be just outside the grid while a 20 lets them pick their location and a 1 starts them as far away from other players as possible).
	* After the first round underwater (6th round overall), each player makes an Investigation check, finding the following things depending on the result: DC 10, they see a bright white light underwater; for every 2 above 10, they find a crew member of the Celeste Noir (in this order: Demetrius dâ€™Lyrandar, Benjamin "Doc Oc" Octavius, Natsuko Hayashi, Oliver Ramorell, Brunhilde Kheldeburn, Aubrey Galatea).
		* Players can hold your breath for 1 + Con modifier minutes (minimum 30 seconds).
		- After that, players stay conscious for Con modifier rounds (minimum 1 round).
		- After that, players drop to 0 hp and start making death saves. They can't regain HP until they get air.
		- Each Action, Reaction, and Bonus Action underwater costs 1 round (6 seconds) of breath.
		* Water is considered difficult terrain without a swim speed, so each foot swam costs one additional foot of movement.
		* Swimming (without a swim speed) or doing anything else of exertion in the rough water requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Failure results in 30 seconds of air being lost instead of 1 round, as they struggle and flounder in the water.
		* Each round that a player speaks or attempts to cast a spell with verbal components removes 30 seconds from the time they can hold their breath.
		* A creature who is holding their breath when they take damage from any source makes a Constitution saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken from the attack, whichever is higher. On a failure, they exhale and run out of breath. It can then survive a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.
