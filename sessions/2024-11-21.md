### Pre-Session Notes

* Hand out Hezcalipa's Heart card.
* Update everyone on the progress of their previous session work as the ship travels to collect assets: to Aerenal to get the Deathguard, to Kasshta Keep to get the monks, and (optionally) to Shining Valley to get Verity's siblings. Also ask if they want to stop and do any shopping.
	* There has been very little news on dragons, only some increased sightings of dragon orcs (Order of the Onyx Scale) across Darguun and Q'barra.
	* Blue dragon advancement has halted entirely.
	* Word arrived from Windsor that the campaign is going well, and it seems unlikely that Corrine will be selected as headmistress.
	* The brass dragon efforts are in total disarray after a very eventful few days. Their strength has been nearly cut in half.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Nothing to report - the mass combat system worked great! If anything it was balanced to be too easy for the players, but the timing worked out great (it took the whole session) and that's the best direction for it to be balanced! Most importantly, everyone liked it and had fun.
- Next time we'll pick up right with the start of Tiamat's Temple.
