[[2-05. Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Asked Demetrius to drop them off at Darguun and pick them up at Newthrone (Q'barra).
* Start with Perception checks from everyone for the rune, then transition into the minotaur finding them (lantern starts flickering between blue and orange, and anything with a good Perception checks hears clanging of metal).
