### Post-Session Write-Up

- Asked Demetrius to drop them off at Darguun and pick them up at Newthrone (Q'barra).
- While on the ship, they learned that the Bronze dragons had built a Shipyard, Brass Bards had become leaders in Zolanberg and Trolanport, all inns in Zilargo and Draguun had been converted to Copper Dragon Inns, and that Thir had spread across Khorvaire.


- Verity would like to help their siblings (get away from their father at least) if possible. Look into other manifest zones to Syrania that could be used later?
- Verity and Thana insulted a potion shopkeeper in Sharn by negotiating poorly (while Aither smoothed things over slightly) - figure out who that is and what he does.
- When they got to Wyvernskull, they convinced Baalo One-Eye that there was treasure hidden somewhere in Rhukaan Draal, so he left them alone.
- Thana did a great job with Survival checks, only failing one with a nat 1. So that night the Bag of Holding was taken by "Vic". They decided to follow footprints they found that led them to the dead-grey mists of the southern end of The Mournland. But they decided to return to the jungle and enter the Mournland later.
- In the Labyrinth they got through the Undead area and the Elemental area without seeing the Minotaur yet.
- When we start back next time, they have just completed a short rest, but the hour spent allowed the Minotaur to catch up with them. Start with an Investigation check to look for the rune, then an encounter with the Minotaur in the Elemental Rest Room.
