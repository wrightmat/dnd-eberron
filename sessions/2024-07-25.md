### Pre-Session Notes

* If they don't long rest, keep the Minotaur at 98 HP (unless that ends up being too easy, in which case add more). If they long rest, reset the Minotaur HP to full.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Ran into Avarice and Vic after 6 days' travel in the jungle.
	- Add Vic as a true stat block so I can use initiative tracker.
- After an extended chase, they made a deal and agreed to take two items from the bag and return everything else to them (and take the bag back. Vic takes the Orb of Dragonkind and Avarice takes the spell scroll of acid arrow.
	- Maybe they call the conference? Need to think on this.
