 [[2-07. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* As they sleep (the night in Taer Valior and every night thereafter as long as they have the soulshard), have each player roll an Arcana check. Anyone who beats the DC of 12 has a shared dream that's constructed of visions of Arstyvrax's life (emanating from the soulshard). Those players also don't gain the benefit of a long rest.
* As they leave the village, Serelath volunteers to scout ahead and leaves the group. As they traverse the desert, DC 12 Nature checks reveal carcasses of various animals (from Serelath's hunting).
* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- They bought ("rented") griffons at Taer Valior for 80 gp each. If they bring them back, they get half (40 gp) back.
