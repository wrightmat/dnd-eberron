 [[2-07. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.
* As they sleep, they each have a shared dream that's constructed of visions of Arstyvrax's life (emanating from the soulshard). Have the group roll an Insight check to determine how much they see, taking the average, with a 10 showing the first bit of history and the next bit being shown with each 3 above that.
* As they leave the village, Serelath volunteers to scout ahead and leaves the group. As they traverse the desert, DC 12 Nature checks reveal carcasses of various animals (from Serelath's hunting).
