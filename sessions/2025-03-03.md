### Pre-Session Notes:
* **Kerrie/Hawthorne**: I added a homebrew item to your sheet: the Press Notebook (unfortunately D&D Beyond doesn't let me make custom gear, so it says wondrous item, but it's really just a tool). This is actually Wisdom based (and modeled after Cartographer's Tools), and is designed to help you gather facts of a story and put it all together in a compelling way - including DCs for crafting a story and gaining access to places you wouldn't normally be able to access.
	* Sort of related, but Newspapers now have a mechanical benefit in the game (much like Maps in the new 2024 rules), which may come up at any point in the campaign!
- **Everyone**: Tweaked social encounter rules! I have developed a system to set a DC for the final Charisma check after a social scene, based on your current relationship points with an NPC. That current relationship points level will also determine how an encounter begins via the NPC's Initial Attitude - with Rival and Nemesis level beginning with an attitude of Hostile and Friend and Beloved level beginning with an attitude of Friendly (and anything in between being indifferent). Either you or I can end a social encounter at any point, resulting in the final Charisma check.
- FYI: You'll level up at the END of this academic year.
