session: "4"

### Pre-Session Notes:
* **Kerrie/Hawthorne**: I added a homebrew item to your sheet: the Press Notebook (unfortunately D&D Beyond doesn't let me make custom gear, so it says wondrous item, but it's really just a tool). This is actually Wisdom based (and modeled after Cartographer's Tools), and is designed to help you gather facts of a story and put it all together in a compelling way - including DCs for crafting a story and gaining access to places you wouldn't normally be able to access.
	* Sort of related, but Newspapers now have a mechanical benefit in the game (much like Maps in the new 2024 rules), which may come up at any point in the campaign!
