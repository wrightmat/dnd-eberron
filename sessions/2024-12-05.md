### Pre-Session Notes

* Epilogues:
	* Chip decides to settle down a bit from his travels and enroll in school at Arcanix, to pursue his wizarding work.
	* Serelath sets back out on his own to continue his adventures, refusing to tell anyone where he's going, allegedly for their protection.
	* Valmoc returns to Sharn in order to smooth over relations between the draconic races and the humanoid ones. He anticipates having a lot of work over the coming years.
	* Tanila is declared as headmistress of Arcanix, beating out Empress Corrine by a wide margin. Corrine returns to Fairhold and the nation of Aundair never expands beyond its current borders.
	* Rannik leaves Zilargo, and without his leadership the Brass Bard troupes disband.
	* Prince Lorrister returns to the Lhazaar Principalities which have returned to their normal level of chaos as the influence of Kythri has waned and the blue dragons have returned to their normal homes.
