### Pre-Session Notes

* Aither: are you cool with embracing the concept of a dragon monk? YES!
* Minor ret-con: mentions of previous obsidian dragons were actually topaz dragons, except one of them was actually black instead of orange.
* Prior to the players going to Sarlona, Valmoc should leave them, only saying that he has business to attend to, leaving the ship in their care. He's actually going to Arcanix, to advance the silver dragons' goals, but will not tell the players under any circumstances.

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Met Imassa when they got to Syrkarn, but didn't trust her so they didn't tell her what they were looking for and just asked for a tour of the town. But Thana saw the temple off in the distance.
* First they stopped off at the bar and met the yuan-ti, who they immediately thought were intentionally segregated by the others. But the yuan-ti didn't see it that way.
* First scene they found was 3 (Xoriat). After a return visit, they saw all three visions from the portal and it went dark.
* Second scene was 2 (Time-Traveling). They fully embraced the trolley problem (of course) and witnessed all four scenarios before finally deciding to leave.
	* They killed Queen ir'Wyrnarn and Cardinal Krozen. They spared Merrix, killing the warforged, and also spared Kaius, killing the undead (where only Thana was left in the room, and left before they were squished).
* Third scene was 1 (Story). Verity placed some of the green potion into a vial, and later asked Reigney about it, so she knows how powerful it is. Aither tried to read the book, but didn't roll very well, so only got the basics.
* An interesting random encounter with the Musteval Guardinals, who Aither immediately bonded with. She tried to convince one of them to come with them, but didn't succeed. He did agree to follow them through the temple, which got interesting when they had a random encounter with will'o'wisps which he immediately ran toward (since he likes lights!). He went unconscious during that battle. She then tried to convince him again after talking to Reigney, but still didn't succeed, so he stayed behind.
* Last scene was 4 (Cleansing Chamber), where Thana almost immediately drank the radiant liquid, without even telling anyone. She succesfully fought off her shadow, and decided to remove her dhampir curse! Verity looked a little sad that there was no liquid left.
* They got lots of questions in with Reiney, and probably have a better understanding of the entire situation now. But Verity turned to stone by answering "life and death" to the riddle, before Aither answered correctly. Next time we start there!

- [ ] #followup  Decide the fallout for the two deaths (Queen ir'Wyrnarn and Cardinal Krozen). Probably not a big impact to the Church (where Onme is still Voice of the Flame), but there will be fallout for Aundair.
