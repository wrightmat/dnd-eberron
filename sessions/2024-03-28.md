[[1-09. Mror Holds and Durgan]] [[1-11. Sarlona and the Final Lair]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Aither: are you cool with embracing the concept of a dragon monk? YES!
* Minor ret-con: mentions of previous obsidian dragons were actually topaz dragons, except one of them was actually black instead of orange.
* Prior to the players going to Sarlona, Valmoc should leave them, only saying that he has business to attend to, leaving the ship in their care. He's actually going to Arcanix, to advance the silver dragons' goals, but will not tell the players under any circumstances.
* When the players return to Sharn later, Valmoc will be there at the dock waiting for them.
