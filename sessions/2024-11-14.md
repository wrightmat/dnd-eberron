- Got the Heart back from Spiney during the chase on the fourth round.
- They sent the Mosaic Committee after the blue dragons. Then they asked Mawaris about any strange happenings in Arcanix, and while she didn't know of anything she said she'd keep an eye out.
- They asked Windsor to try and hurt the Empress' chances at the University via sabotage.
- TODO: Adjust Morale for blue dragons.
