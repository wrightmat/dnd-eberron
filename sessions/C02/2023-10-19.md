[[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Return to the discussion that Atlas had with Escher in the lobby outside of their room. He would actually give him more information, but in a hushed, almost cryptic manner. "Many treasures lie within the crypts in the depths of the castle. But remember that Strahd has eyes everywhere."
* Wizard of Wines (pg. 173)
	* `encounter: 5: Needle Blight` (6 waves)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 1: Twig Blight` (swarm of 24) (added wave 3) - killed in W9
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 5: Needle Blight` (added wave 4) - killed in W13 (1 ran away, and joined the waves outside later)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 2: Vine Blight` (added wave 5) - killed in W20
	* Davian Martikov should direct the players to Yester Hill, but only after they have gained his trust (probably by clearing the Winery of bad guys). Only then does he tell them that the vineyard’s three magic “seeds” have been stolen. He describes them as "gems the size and shape of pinecones, each one containing a glowing green light as bright as a torch". For the good of all Barovia, he urges the characters to travel to Yester Hill (area Y) to retrieve the most recently stolen one. He is unsure where the other two went many years ago.

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* The group fully explored the winery, and took out all of the druids and blights inside (while finding some treasure). When they got back outside to the veranda, the final six waves of blights attacked. They managed to get through it all without anyone dying (Atlas only went unconscious for a bit) and with only a single short rest.
* Davian told them about the "seed" at Yester Hill, and they agreed to help out.
* Plan next time is to either stop at Vallaki and drop off the few bottles of wine they got from the cellar, or to go straight to Yester Hill and return with barrels of wine afterward.
