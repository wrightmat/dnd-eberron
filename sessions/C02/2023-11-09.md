### Pre-Session Notes:

* Strahd can be found in the Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (K88). He is there because it's the anniversary of their death, and is paying his respects. He will not leave before the three hours is up, and is protected while inside by the Guardians. Once the three hours is up, Strahd will hunt down the party, or simply move to Sergei's Tomb (K85) if the party is already in the catacombs.
	*  "He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all."

### Post-Session Write-Up:

They explored most of the castle with their three hours, and got the remaining Tarroka reading items from the crypts. Atlas spent an hour hanging out with Escher to attune to the Sun Sword. Then they gathered in the Cathedral to get ready for Strahd's appearance. We made it to the top of the 6th round of battle before close. 

Next time, have Strahd attack whoever is near him to start off the battle again, then have him do his dramatic twist at Initiative 20 (after Selena's turn), turn to mist, and then slip through the walls of the Cathedral, escaping down to Sergei's Tomb. When they arrive down there, Strahd should immediately use *mage hand* to close the portcullis, trapping everyone (ideally except for Willimond if possible, so he can charm the others) in the Tomb (except for Strahd himself, who could slip through the walls if needed). Finally, Strahd should fully heal (or 20 HP per round for as many rounds as it takes for them to get down there), and then resume initiative order with Atlas.
