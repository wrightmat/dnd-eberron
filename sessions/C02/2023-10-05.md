[[C02 Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:

* The group selected the Ravens Tract (between Ravens and Dragons).

* Card Reading:
	* 4 (Enemy)- Donjon- This card refers to Stella Wachter (see chapter 5, area N4n). She grants the party no benefit unless her madness is cured. With her wits restored, Stella is happy to join the party and leave her rotten family behind.
		* "Find a girl driven to insanity, locked in the heart of her dead father’s house. Curing her madness is key to your success."
	* 5 (Strahd)- Broken One- Strahd faces the characters in Sergei’s tomb (area K85).
		* "He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all."
	* 1 (Tome)- Druid- The treasure lies at the base of the Gulthias tree (chapter 14, area Y4). Any wereraven encountered in the wilderness can lead the characters to the location.
		* "An evil tree grows atop a hill of graves where the ancient dead sleep. The ravens can help you find it. Look for the treasure there."
	* 2 (Holy Symbol)- Paladin- The treasure lies in Sergei’s tomb (chapter 4, area K85).
		* "I see a sleeping prince, a servant of light and the brother of darkness. The treasure lies with him."
	* 3 (Sunsword)- Mercenary- The treasure lies in a crypt in Castle Ravenloft (chapter 4, area K84, crypt 31).
		* "The thing you seek lies with the dead, under mountains of gold coins."

* Spent the light in the Vistani camp, where the party learned more about them and heard their stories (while Selena got wine drunk).
* The next morning they left for the Village and met Ismark in the tavern after seeking out the crying woman and learning about Mad Mary's daughter Gertruda (although they don't know where she is or anything, just that she's missing).
* Immediately they agreed to help and went to the mansion to meet Ireena. They also agreed to help her take the body to the church.
* At the church, they learned about Doru, and discussed quite a long while about what to do. Eventually Selena convinced Father Donavan that maybe they were the gods' response to his prayers, so he agreed to let them "take care of" Doru. Selena went down there with Willimond, who donated one of his many stakes to the task. Selena did the deed, and passed her roll for Stress, but Willimond didn't take to the watching of the deed as well (failed his roll for Stress).
* Donavan then proceeded with the funeral rites in the graveyard at dusk.
* Pick up next time at the church and do a quick scene with Strahd paying his respects to the dead burgomaster in the graveyard.
