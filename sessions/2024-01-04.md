### Pre-Session Notes:



### Post-Session Write-Up:

Notes from The Quiet Year game (which went great!):
* Adar feeds (at least certain) criminals to the blue dragons that are prevalent in the area.
* A cult in Adar (but from Syrkarn, called the Wanderers of Twlight, who want to expand the manifest zones) wants the manifest zones to stay open, and is willing to hurt people who try to close them down.
* Pyrine was the first to establish trade for food with other regions, starting with food to Ohr Kaluun.
* Buried statue unearthed by a small boy (Rask, who eventually became an archeologist) in Borunan leading to the eventual excavation of a buried city. The ogre mages took interest and started helping, finding a temple containing a large gemstone inside.
* Syrkarn helped to establish democracy in Rhiavhaar, and then established a trade route for fish. They then set up a military force that mostly just drove criminality underground.
* After finishing excavating their mountain cave, Borunan trades building materials with Pyrine in exchange for access to fishing.
* Adar establishes an Olympic-like games for competitive art, which occurs in the summer.
* Pyrine re-established their temples to the Sovereign Host, serving as houses of healing as well.
* Ohr Kaluun found an infernal engine, which started gaining power unexpectedly, then disappeared (taking the researchers with it). Later a body of one of the researchers is found on an entirely different island. Even later, the engine itself appears in Pyrine.
* Eberron dragonshards discovered in the marshes for Rhiavhaar.
* Ohr Kaluun has a revolution where the aristocracy is killed and the people take power. Then they instate a king.
* Rhiavhaar, Syrkarn, Adar, and Ohr Khaluun are all open to better relationships and increased trade (but probably not a full unified government).
* Rhiavhaar population increases, while Syrkarn's decreased from a natural disaster (reality storm).

- [ ] #followup The [[Infernal Engine]] needs to come back into play at least a few times, as everyone was really excited about the idea.
* Could go the 4400-inspired route, where the people the Infernal Engine has taken start returning. Start with one returnee being found somewhere, who can explain the basics of where the taken are. Could also introduce a colony in the Mournland if the PCs end up wanting to go there. Also just have periodic disappearances noted around the world (in newspapers and such).
* Or just use the Infernal Engine as a plot device when no session is prepared, or we want a break. Have the engine appear somewhere and the players have to deal with it. Or make it into something they have to deal with - like an elemental land cart that is picking up people (taxi style), but never dropping them off.
