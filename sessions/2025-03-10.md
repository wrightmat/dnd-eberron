session: "5"

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Waiting outside of their room(s) is a basket containing half a dozen (6) potions of healing, with a note signed by various other students acknowledging their epic retrieval of Sassy Sally Jane.
* Nora pulls Hawthorne aside as the group leaves for classes. Since there's only about four weeks left in the term, Hawthorne's request was denied. If he and Shear end up in the same college next year, this request will be taken under advisement during room selection. Hawthorne can choose whether Shear is even told about the request.
* At the next opportunity, Shear is pulled aside by Nora and told about the dead frogs that she had cleaned up, and that keeping dead animals in the room is against the rules.
* After the boss battle, as their last day in class, hand out the leylines map. This was received in any Intro to... course or Beginning Computational Magic (so everyone gets one in-character).
