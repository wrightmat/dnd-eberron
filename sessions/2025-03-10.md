### Pre-Session Notes:
* Waiting outside of their room(s) is a basket containing half a dozen (6) potions of healing, with a note signed by various other students acknowledging their epic retrieval of Sassy Sally Jane.
* Nora pulls Hawthorne aside as the group leaves for classes. Since there's only about four weeks left in the term, Hawthorne's request was denied. If he and Shear end up in the same college next year, this request will be taken under advisement during room selection. Hawthorne can choose whether Shear is even told about the request.
* At the next opportunity, Shear is pulled aside by Nora and told about the dead frogs that she had cleaned up, and that keeping dead animals in the room is against the rules.

### Post-Session Write-Up:
- They fully explored Sedgemoor, fought all of the various things, and found the spell components. They also cleared the spring, and found Murgaxor's notebook.
- They decided to immediately go to Wiltroot Hall and figure out what's going on there. Hawthorne stayed behind in the Hall (with Mina's owl familiar) while the rest of the party explored some of the area. After finding Javenesh and helping with the water weird situation, the owl returned to them letting them know that Hawthorne had seen a strange bullywug approaching.
- The rest of the party get back about the time that Murgaxor started his ritual. It was a grueling fight, where Mina started focusing on the ritual stones, while the other attacked Murgaxor and his mephits. Every member of the part went down at least once (with Alton holding the record of seven times) except for Mina, who maintained distance and spammed witch bolt along with mage hand to throw stones around.
- Only Alton fully died, and it was basically in the last round of combat. In that same round, the owl re-appeared with Professor Lang running quickly behind, and Mina popped Murgaxor like a bloody pimple using one last witch bolt. Professor Lang agreed to take Alton and have him revivified by the Oracle, while the rest of the party returned to their dorm to rest.
- Next time we'll start with any year-end downtime and final relationship building. Then we'll move on to summer break scenes, and then start up with Year 2!
- TODO: Send Kerrie information about the "reality storms" of Adar.
