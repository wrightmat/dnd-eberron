[[1-12. Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Use the time on the ship after leaving Xen'drik to cover more of [[Valmoc]]'s backstory (parent, time founding the Silver Scales, etc.)
* If the players return to Regalport to see the play, then jump to the new "Optional: The Grand Thuranni Theater" at the end of [[1-08. Lhazaar and Lirmar]].
* Try to nudge them toward the Moonsword Jungle first. Maybe a letter from Thana's uncle or something?
* If time left at the end of this session (before moving on to any of the second chapter adventures), it would be a good time to do a first chapter recap and check-in. Make sure everyone understands that the first chapter was designed to set the scene, introduce concepts and characters, and give options - but the second chapter will be way more on the players to determine what happens next. I've given more adventure options, but you'll also want to come up with your own plans for gaining allies, learning more about whatever groups interest you, and eventually taking on the topaz dragons. Also the factions that have been introduced will start pursuing their own goals between your sessions, based on their resource and abilities, and what you all do.
