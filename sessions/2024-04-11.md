[[1-12. Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Use the time on the ship after leaving Xen'drik to cover more of Valmoc's backstory (parent, time found the Silver Scales, etc.)
* If the players return to Regalport to see the play, then jump to the new "Optional: The Grand Thuranni Theater" at the end of [[1-08. Lhazaar and Lirmar]].

### Post-Session Write-Up
