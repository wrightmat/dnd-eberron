[[2-04. Echoes of the Celestial Realm]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* When returning to the ship after Arcanix, have Oliver Ramorell, Quartermaster of the *Celeste Noir* (who's originally from Darguun), direct the party to Darguun. He's heard the group talking about the magic map, and recognized that location. There is an ancient labyrinth there is said to hold powerful magic. He'd ever believed it before, but it seems now like it must be true!
