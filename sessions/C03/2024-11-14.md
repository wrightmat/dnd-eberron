### Pre-Session Notes

* 

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Got the Heart back from Spiney during the chase on the fourth round.
- They handed the soulshard over to the Mosaic Committee, and then asked them to take care of the blue dragons as payment. Then they asked Mawaris about any strange happenings in Arcanix, and while she didn't know of anything she said she'd keep an eye out.
- Went to Fairhold and talked to Corrine in disguise as Tanila, in order to learn about her plans and what Project Emerald actually is. So they know about the reach of the planned empire, but still not much else. So they decided to go to the Eldeen Reaches, and ended up speaking with Oalian. He didn't know of anything wrong with the woods, but had sensed some minor strangeness on the periphery of the Reaches. He agreed to have his Wardens of the Woods look into things, and reach out if he found anything.
- They went back to Arcanix and asked Windsor to try and hurt the Empress' chances at the University via sabotage. He agreed, and said he'd reach out with any news.
- They then moved on to Zilargo, where they had a social encounter with several members of the Brass Bards. They learned all about their plans to get their leader elected to the Triumvarate, and immediately decided to thwart all of them. Right after the concert, they set out for the docks - where they convinced the brass dragon there to set the boat with the instruments on fire. The next morning they infiltrated the political meeting (Verity under invisibility) and poisoned Vashel's mimosa. Then they attended the rally where they found a bunch of brass dragonborn scrambling to deal with a hungover Rannik with no help from their planner. The speech did not go well, and Verity convinced Nimira (via the message spell) to just leave the Brass Bards entirely. Needless to say, Rannik did NOT win the election.
- TODO: Adjust Morale for blue dragons, Corrine and the green dragons, and the brass dragons.
