### Pre-Session Notes

* If they don't long rest, keep the Minotaur at 98 HP (unless that ends up being too easy, in which case add more). If they long rest, reset the Minotaur HP to full.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Ran into Avarice and Vic after 6 days' travel in the jungle (with nothing else super substantial happening).
- After an extended chase, they made a deal and Avarice/Vic who agreed to take two items from the bag and return everything else to the party (and take the bag back to Garrick). Vic takes the Orb of Dragonkind and Avarice takes the spell scroll of acid arrow.
	- Maybe they call the conference? Or the group finds them again in Argonnessen? Need to think on this.
- Start at Barren Keep in the Mournland.
