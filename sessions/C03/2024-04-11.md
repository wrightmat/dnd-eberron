[[1-12  Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]] [[2-01  The Storm of Speartip]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Use the time on the ship after leaving Xen'drik to cover more of [[Valmoc]]'s backstory (parent, time founding the Silver Scales, etc.)
* If the players return to Regalport to see the play, then jump to the new "Optional: The Grand Thuranni Theater" at the end of [[1-08  Lhazaar and Lirmar]].
* Try to nudge them toward the Moonsword Jungle first. Maybe a letter from Thana's uncle or something?
* If time left at the end of this session (before moving on to any of the second chapter adventures), it would be a good time to do a first chapter recap and check-in. Make sure everyone understands that the first chapter was designed to set the scene, introduce concepts and characters, and give options - but the second chapter will be way more on the players to determine what happens next. I've given more adventure options, but you'll also want to come up with your own plans for gaining allies, learning more about whatever groups interest you, and eventually taking on the topaz dragons. Also the factions that have been introduced will start pursuing their own goals between your sessions, based on their resource and abilities, and what you all do.

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Spent a lot of time with the cats in Flamewind's lair, because they didn't want to harm them. But they got the map information they need, and later while interpreting things on the ship, they figured out what the colors meant.
* Went to Stormreach and while checking out an artifact shop, they decided to purchase the small wyrm statue that whispered their way to the Obsidian City. From the leader there, they learned all about the necromantic wyrm and how a topaz dragon appeared once and left changed. They decided not to approach the wyrm's cave.
* Left Xen'drik and returned to Regalport where they saw the play, and witnessed the appearance of the infernal engine. Afterward, they talked to the actor, and clearly knew she was Sapphire Scale and couldn't be trusted, but didn't ask many questions. At that moment, a large storm began brewing outside and they decided to hop on the shop and go sail into it! Also, we learned that Demetrius was drunk when they got to the ship (2 levels of Inebriation).
* *Celeste Noir* is a Sailing Ship (GoS).
* Maelstrom rounds: (start with round 4 and the battle next time)
	* Round 1: Lightning Strikes the ship. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 2: Dragon flew overhead. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 3: Wild Magic Fog rolled in. Crew maintained course toward the eye.
	* Round 4: Necromancy Magical Storm.
