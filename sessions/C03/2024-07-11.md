### Pre-Session Notes

* Anything cool from Level 8?
* **Scroll of Teleport**. Verity is Very Familiar with the plane of Syrania, so they can declare where on the plane they're trying to arrive, and I roll a d100 per the table on the spell. On a 25-100, they arrive exactly where they want to. On a 14-24 they arrive in the Immeasureable Market right in front of Miraela's stand. On a 01-13 they arrive directly in front of Verity's father.
	* Aeon is coldly disappointed with Verity. After calling Honor and Joy over, he forbids Verity from ever returning (barring them from the plane), saying something along the lines of: "Listen to me closely, for I will only say this once. This is the plane of peace. You know nothing of peace, and only the opposite follows you. First your mother, now your siblings, and soon those who follow you now. You will leave this place and never return - you are barred from Syrania."
	* Honor and Verity should place their hand on each of Verity's shoulders, thanking them, and then fly away with their father.
* When returning to the ship after Arcanix, have Oliver Ramorell, Quartermaster of the *Celeste Noir* (who's originally from Darguun), direct the party to Darguun. He's heard the group talking about the magic map, and recognized that location. There is an ancient labyrinth there that's is said to hold powerful magic. He'd never believed it before, but it seems now like it must be true!

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Asked Demetrius to drop them off at Darguun and pick them up at Newthrone (Q'barra).
- While on the ship, they learned that the Bronze dragons had built a Shipyard, Brass Bards had become leaders in Zolanberg and Trolanport, all inns in Zilargo and Draguun had been converted to Copper Dragon Inns, and that Thir had spread across Khorvaire.

- Verity would like to help their siblings (get away from their father at least) if possible. Look into other manifest zones to Syrania that could be used later?
- Verity and Thana insulted a potion shopkeeper in Sharn by negotiating poorly (while Aither smoothed things over slightly) - figure out who that is and what he does.
- When they got to Wyvernskull, they convinced Baalo One-Eye that there was treasure hidden somewhere in Rhukaan Draal, so he left them alone.
- Thana did a great job with Survival checks, only failing one with a nat 1. So that night the Bag of Holding was taken by "Vic". They decided to follow footprints they found that led them to the dead-grey mists of the southern end of The Mournland. But they decided to return to the jungle and enter the Mournland later.
- In the Labyrinth they got through the Undead area and the Elemental area without seeing the Minotaur yet.
- When we start back next time, they have just completed a short rest, but the hour spent allowed the Minotaur to catch up with them. Start with an Investigation check to look for the rune, then an encounter with the Minotaur in the Elemental Rest Room.
