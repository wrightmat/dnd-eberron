[[2-04  Echoes of the Celestial Realm]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* After recap: Inspiration for Kerrie (roleplaying last time)
* When back on the ship: News from Doc Oc:
	* Have you heard about the Brass Bards? They're all the rage across Zilargo right now. Apparently troops have been performing in all the major cities - Zolanberg, Trolanport, and Korranberg.
	* This crazy machine showed up on one of the islands in the Lhazaar Principalities, then disappeared a day later, taking 30 people with it! Oh, and apparently magic has been going crazy over there too!

### Post-Session Write-Up

* They waited until they got back to the ship, and got all the news from Doc Oc, before using the spellshard. But thanks to really good rolls from Verity, they got all kinds of good information about most of the factions! They learned everything about the gold dragons, even though they haven't even met one. And they got basic information about all the other factions (except for the copper dragons, but they don't seem concerned about them).
* Took the ship to Arcanix, where they rode hippogriffs up to the Floating Towers (except Verity, who flew). Valmoc showed them to Windsor's office, and they caught up on the recent happenings (and Windsor also promised to give them one of his books he wrote about his planar travels). After Verity filled in the party on their history related to Syrania, Windsor dialed the Gate of Xabra and they were off and flying.
* Verity disguised self, and chatted with the angel at the gate under a different voice. But then they all decided to head to the Immeasureable Market first and Verity was immediately found out. She reluctantly agreed to retrieve the items from the Undercloud.
* Thana immediately got magic item vibes, but the group wasn't super stealthy and had to fight a cloud. But on the second Investigation check they found the book, and were able to get into the portal before the clouds got them.
* Inside, Thana and Verity decided to get manicures while Aither creepily snuck around the outside of the building. She saw Joy through a window, but wasn't blinded. Then she saw the naiad through another window, and found the other buildings in the back. The other two found Honor in the lounge and immediately discovered that something was wrong with him. After searching the other rooms, they eventually managed to talk to Joy through the door, and realized that something must have been very wrong with her too.
* Everyone regrouped and filled each other in, then decided to go to the bath house to check out the blue figure Aither saw. Cyrena decided to trust them, and told them all about the hags, Sylvarie, and the paintings (although she didn't know details, like where they were, but knew they had to be destroyed to help the trapped people).
* When we ended, the group was trying to decide how to take on the hags.
