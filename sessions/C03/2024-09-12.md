 [[2-08  An Irian Adventure]]

### Pre-Session Notes

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Everyone survived the water, except for Brumhilde, who died from a shark bite. The rest of the crew traveled with them to Irian through the portal. Should probably figure out where they all go - possibly they join Prince Lorrister's crew?
- Aither immediately fell in love with Snips' new form, but also had a bit of an existential crisis when she realized that all the times that Snips had died that he was actually returning to Irian and coming back as what she thought was just a new mouse. So the fact that it was the same Snips all along was a bit mind blowing.
- Thana immediately agreed to help the Dawn Empress with the planar seed. They had no issue with battling the creatures, and managed to protect the tree. Thana also immediately welcomed the horse as her new companion, which she recognized as an Aerenal-like steed.
- Verity was easily able to convince the Radiant Court to release the planar seed. They also asked Luminael about the ritual that would connect her to Irian (after the Dawn Empress had mentioned it), and after getting more details they agreed to undergo it after the planar seed was returned.
- Then they returned to the seed, Thana placed her former longsword from Aerenal (that has been replaced by the moonblade) under the tree in the center, starting the ritual.
- Ended with the Void Knight stabbing Thana in the gut. Next time start there, with Thana taking a Void Gauntlet attack, but ensure they all got a long rest first.
