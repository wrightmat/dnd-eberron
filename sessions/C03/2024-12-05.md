### Pre-Session Notes

### Post-Session Write-Up

- They beheaded Arstyvrax, so that head is almost certainly hanging in the Mosaic Commission's headquarters.
- Aither continued her travels around the world, now with Seralath accompanying her, in an effort to continue spreading the light and to reach enlightenment herself. Seralath now has a safe home in Argonnesson that he can return to at any time (thanks to a favor from the Lightkeeper), so he returns there occasionally and Aither goes as well. Aither may even decide to take on leadership of the monastery at a later date after her travels.
	- Definitely use Aither as the primary Path of Light NPC in the next campaign, since she is already traveling around the world and can encounter the players wherever needed.
- Thana returns to Aerenal after asking the Light of Siberys for help restoring Shae Mordai. Upon return, she immediately feels the presence of her ancestors once again, their souls (including her parents) restored to their rightful place. She builds a monument to the events that occurred at Shae Mordai in 1051, so no one will forget those lost.
- After returning to the Sarlona with their siblings to catch up, Verity decides to sell their home and move to Aerenal with Thana, taking her up on a blanket offer to all of her friends.
- Most importantly, Chip is enrolled in Arcanix as their first warforged student.
