### Pre-Session Notes

* Anything cool with Level 7?

### Post-Session Write-Up

* The group spoke with the kobolds in their colony, and decided to go take on the mushroom monster threat. Meepo led them there, but got knock unconscious almost immediately.
* Thana and Aither were infected with mindrot spores. On their first long rest, Aither succumbed to it, but Thana cast lesser restoration, clearing the disease. Thana still has it, but it hasn't flared up yet, so she'll need to do the save on her next long rest.
* Verity got a potion of fire breathing and a potion of fire resistance from the area around the dragon fountain. They also grabbed the Night Caller whistle.
	* TODO: Make a card for the Night Caller.
* After killing the two initial guard orcs, they took one of their initiate scales that they found (but don't yet know what it does). Using it and Verity's skills of persuasion, they convinced the orcs in Practice Range (area 27) that they wanted to join the Order, staying friendly with them. They told the party to find Gharzaak if they wanted to join.
* Calcryx is still in the Throne Room, where the party left her after levitating and subduing her. She agreed not to eat them immediately if they let her down.
* They then headed straight down the hallway and found Gharzaak. They learned the basic tenants of the Order and learned that they'd either need to descend the shaft or face off against Gharzaak in order to be considered. So they eventually descended.
* Ended in the Rift Node (room 37) after defeating the Mineral Ooze.
