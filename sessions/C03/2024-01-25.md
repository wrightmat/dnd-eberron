[[1-03  Thrane and Tahorep]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Lightning Rail: 1200 miles to Ghalt, 1.7 days, 80 gp via second class (or 240 gp first class, or 20 gp steerage).
	* What did you all do while on the lightning rail? Get to know each other? Otherwise Valmoc could ask some questions to get to know everyone.


### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Bought the Lantern for 200 gp after a bit of negotiation. Figured out the time weirdness connection to the lair without any problem.
* Verity pocketed the Orb which they found in the library instead. Tahorep knew it though, and still told them about how it works.
* When the Shae Mordai attack happened, Thana woke up and most had died in their sleep, but some were dead in the street and that freaked her out enough to encourage her to leave.
* Probably heading to Zilargo next, so they're pretty close to Sharn to get more money. Do a scene in Flamekeep first, though.

* Do more physical puzzles!
