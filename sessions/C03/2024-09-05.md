 [[2-07  Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]] [[2-08  An Irian Adventure]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.
* After they get caught up with everyone on the ship, it's attacked by topaz dragons, led by Arstyvrax. Start by rolling initiative, following the outline of the "Dragon Attack" scene in "An Irian Adventure".
* Doc Oc news: people have been talking about how Thronehold is suddenly being remodeled! It's been sitting basically vacant since the end of the Last War, so it was pretty surprising.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- They got through the waves of undead, and managed to finish the ritual right after the last wave hit, then cleaned up the rest of the undead. In the hoard room, Verity stole a few of the gems, while Thana tried to read some of the scrolls and Aither checked the trinkets. They ended up not having a hard time at all with the gypsosphinx (I pulled my punches too much, apparently), with Aither doing 30 to 40 damage per round.
- When they woke up, they explored the whole of the "new" temple (originally thinking they were dead, but eventually decided against it). In the pool room, Thana asked to see her parents (and was shown a large crystal holding the Shae Mordai captured souls in the depths of Argonnessen), Verity asked to see their siblings (and saw the Shining Valley, but didn't do well enough to a subsequent check to recognize the location except it wasn't Pyrine), and Aither asked to see the leader of the Order of the Ruby Scale (and saw the sun up a bright clear sky, since their dragon leader has died and ascended to Dol Arrah).
- They approached the Incarnum and asked a few questions about magic, but didn't get a ton of extra information (and didn't need to be told anything too substantial since they've been getting a lot of information from other sources). They did learn about magic being channeled from various locations to a central location (Argonnessen), and about the concept of laylines. It also suggested that channeled magic should probably be stopped at the source, but could also possibly be interrupted along the transmission lines?
- They left the temple and successfully found their griffon mounts, decided to head straight back to the ship. They landed the griffons on the ship and chatted up Demetrius and Doc Oc, getting the latest and only news. Verity then filled in Valmoc on all their adventures. Thana and Aither both looked up into the sky and saw the dragons approaching! Next time we start right off with the Dragon Attack.
- TO DO: Look into ideas for how they might be able to magically interrupt layline transmission of the magic, in case they decide to go that route.
