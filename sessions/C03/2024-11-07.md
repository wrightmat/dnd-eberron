 [[2-10  Traversing Argonnessen]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* News: The Infernal Engine randomly appeared in Valenar, disappearing 1 day later, and taking 125 people with it.
* Long rest. During which they discover that Seralath has gone missing.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- The group awoke to Serelath missing, and immediately investigated. He rolled poorly on Stealth, so was found out by the dragon near the fountain upon his attempted return, and talked his way out of it by promising to tell her about the Crystal Library - but members of the party heard the whole exchange. When he got back down to the sewer, he was immediately confronted and finally came clean. The party agreed to remain friends, and he agreed to help them in their quest to take on the dragons' plot to release Tiamat.
- After exploring the Archive briefly, the party was found out by a patrolling dragon, who they convinced to just release them outside of the city. Then Serelath flew them to Seren Island where Prince Lorrister's ship picked them up. They caught up with Doc Oc and rested while making their way to Thronehold.
- Once there, they stealthfully explored the grounds and attempted to enter the basement first. But they saw the gold wyrmlings before they could be attacked, and escaped to instead approach the open window to the second floor. They explored the whole floor without incident, avoiding the war room soldiers with clever use of invisibility, but went back out to window and back to the basement rather than heading downstairs. This time the hallway was clear, so they explored most of the rooms in the basement after hearing a faint shoveling sound. Unfortunately they spend too much time exploring, and they time they got to the excavation site Spiney and her workers were gone.
- They fought the gold wyrmlings in the hallway without too much incident, but by then Spiney was already halfway gone. So Aither ran after her while the others trailed, and she cleverly used levitate to try and keep the Heart out of Spiney's hands. Unfortunately for the group, she was too good at holding on to it, despite repeated attempts. Once the rest of the party arrived, they managed to take out the gold dragonborn pretty easily, but Spiney got away.
- Spiney managed to fly away with the Heart in tow, headed south (toward Argonnessen, but they don't necessarily know that).
- They ran to the airship ready to chase after Spiney. So prep some airship chase rules!
- Other prep notes:
	- Might look into the Emerald Scale, primarily for information gathering, but also maybe getting Arcanix on their side.
	- May be interested in doing more with the Silver Flame.
	- They're also interested in the brass dragons and their "mob".
