 [[2-08  An Irian Adventure]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Ensure they got a long rest. Then start with Thana getting stabbed in the gut with a Void Gauntlet attack.
* Have the PCs figure out what to do with all of the Celeste Noir crew by having Demetrius confront them about it. If they don't decide, he leaves for the bar (Club Starlight), and Valmoc reminds them of the other ship they know about and the captain (Prince Lorrister).

### Post-Session Write-Up

- They didn't have a lot of trouble with the Void Knight, and Aither even managed to kill it before they finished the ritual (while Verity invisibly chanted and Thana did the ritual).
- Afterward, Verity decided to undergo the ritual to become an Irian aasimar. They struggled a bit at every step, but channeled that hardship and succeeded on the second or third checks, finishing the ritual with three levels of exhaustion. Kerrie decided to swap out his Celestial Revelation from Necrotic Shroud to Radiant Consumption (now with glowing eyes and radiant damage). They also received their owl-like companion!
- When they got back to the outskirts of the Amaranthine City, Demetrius confronted them about wanting a new ship. When they floundered about knowing anyone who had a ship, Valmoc brought up Prince Lorrister's flying ship. So they decided to call him and ask for his help. He agreed to give them a ride if they met him in Breland by going through the manifest zone. In the 12 hour downtime, Verity and Thana decided to explore the city while Aither watched over drunk Demetrius. They went with Saeralath and Doc Oc to the Starlight Club, but Searalth didn't go in becuase Doc Oc snuck in disguised as him. They each ordered drinks, which was mostly and uninteresting affair, except that Doc Oc was transported to Risia for a minute. When he got back, he sat down and the other two decided to hit the dance floor, where they both became charmed into dancing for quite some time, until Doc Oc came back and slapped them out of their stupor.
- They left the club and returned to the group. Aither decided to explore the city with Snips, and went to the frozen yogurt shop. Snips got his favorite flavor (Radiant Rum Raisin) and Aither got what the shopkeeper recommended based on her request for pineapple (Golden Sunfruit Swirl). They then got a couple variety cups to bring back to the group. After everyone was rested, they stepped through the manifest zone into the Shining Valley.
- Verity discovered that their siblings were there, and they traded their stories. Verity also got their sending stone numbers, so they could keep in touch. After a while, Lorrister arrived and they filled him in on the whole end of the world situation, after which he recommended they get an army. Or several.
- They decided to go on to Adar to find out the details of the letter that Aither got. Chip, Saeralath, Valmoc, and Doc Oc all accompanied them, while everyone else stayed on the ship (which left, and Lorrister told them to call him whenever they need a ride). At the Keep, she learned that their blue dragons were acting strangely, and some odd magic had been detected in the mountains, but no one has been able to investigate because the Unity Games are starting. Unless Aither wanted to compete, of course!
- TO DO: Prepare a bracket for the games, and come up with a list of random NPCs (including some from previous campaigns) to use as competitors.
