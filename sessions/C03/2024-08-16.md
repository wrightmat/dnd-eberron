 [[2-07. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* As they sleep (the night in Taer Valior and every night thereafter as long as they have the soulshard), have each player roll an Arcana check. Anyone who beats the DC of 12 has a shared dream that's constructed of visions of Arstyvrax's life (emanating from the soulshard). Those players also don't gain the benefit of a long rest.
* As they leave the village, Serelath volunteers to scout ahead and leaves the group. As they traverse the desert, DC 12 Nature checks reveal carcasses of various animals (from Serelath's hunting).
* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- They bought ("rented") griffons at Taer Valior for 80 gp each. If they bring them back, they get half (40 gp) back.
- Three days' travel across the desert revealed who had a good relationship with their new mounts (Aither and Chip were consistently great, Thana and Serelath had a rocky relationship with theirs, and Verity's was mostly indifferent until the end). On the first night, a few of the party noticed that Serelath had snuck out in the night, and they confronted him about it. He admitted to going out and hunting in the night, but was adamant that it was no big deal. Eventually they dropped it, but it will almost certainly come up again.
- When they got near the mountains, they camped after not seeing anything of interest as the sun was going down. The next morning, they mounted their griffons and found the cave without much trouble. So they never visited any of the three areas!
- Ended right before the Arena of Bones room, so we can start with the waves of enemies next time. They'll have to go back and place a sacrifice in the first bowl in order to advance into the inner sanctum.
