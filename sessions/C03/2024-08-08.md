 [[2-06. The Draconic Soulshard]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Announcement: For healing in the Mournland, I'm not going to reduce it in any way, and we'll just stick with the short rest and long rest changes.
* Announcement: New homebrew rule for Help Actions (if everyone is cool with it - get feedback).
* If they find the soulshard without fighting the dragon, have Drugor steal it from them (after going the first flashback scene once they touch the shard). Each time they take it back from them, start a new flashback scene.

### Post-Session Write-Up

- Headed back to Greenland, but went south through the Broken Tower first. They angered the daelkyr when they refused their offer, and started a fight, but they were able to run away pretty easily.
- Arrived back in Greenland and rested one night. The next day, they were accused of murder (Mason). They spent the day asking around, but rolled really badly lots of times and didn't find out much. When they starting asking random people in the village, they met Chip, who actually did have some information for them.
- They ended up adopting Chip, agreeing to let him tag along with them when they left the Mournland. He helped them clear their name by convincing Hammer to give them one more day to investigate, which they used to raise the dead body of Mason and ask the question of who killed him.
- The party then returned to the Cavern of Flesh (leaving Chip at Greenland temporarily). Verity snuck in the back door, invisible, and eventually found the soulshard. But Drugar heard them and snatched it back, so Thana cast hold person and they grabbed it and get out of there just as the dragon was waking.
- They returned to get Chip, and then headed east to get out of the Mournland. They fought the Vapor Lynx to escape, and ended in Taer Valior. We'll start there next time, after they've finished a long rest (and leveled up to level 9), and they'll need to determine their next route!
- TO DO: Prep this area by researching more about Valenar and how to help them get out of this area and toward someplace that can direct them to the sphinx.
	- Idea: If they get on griffons (an airship should probably be prohibitively expensive for them anyway), maybe they're shot down over Hope, because the people there think they're shooting at the sphinx.
- TO DO: Make NPC cards for Valmoc, Seralath, and Chip (use Chat GPT to help flesh out the last two).
