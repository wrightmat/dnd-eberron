[[1-11  Sarlona and the Final Lair]] [[1-12  Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Change Verity's petrification. Do a DC 10 CON save for each of four areas of the body - the head, the abdomen, the arms, and the legs. Any failures result in that part of the body being petrified.  
* Any cool things from Level 6?
* If/when the players return to Sharn, it's being attacked. See [[1-12  Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]] adventure and the "Attack on Morgrave University" scene.
* If the players return to Regalport to see the play, then jump to the new "Optional: The Grand Thuranni Theater" at the end of [[1-08  Lhazaar and Lirmar]].

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Turns out only one of Verity's legs was turned to stone, so they floated her to the Temple of the Flame that Binds and convinced the priest to cast greater restoration (for only about 32 gold, which they passed off as the 450 gp he asked for).
* Dragon attack went as expected, and they heard Flamewind's last words and then went to talk to Valmoc. Then they returned to Flamewind's office to get their gold (1200 gp total, divided evenly, so 300 gp a piece).
* Thana bought a diamond for revivify and a longsword. Staff went spell scroll shopping (which we took offline).
* They hopped on the ship and headed to Stormreach. Didn't seem to interested in the town, and left for the jungle. Failed the first group Survival check and ran into a couple of allosauruses, who also killed Staff during their attack. But they managed to take them out and pass the second Survival check, leading them to the temple.
* Valmoc stayed outside investigating the statues, while they went inside and checked all the rooms, which they just did sequentially. Most went as expected, but they mage handed their way through the tentacle room, and lied to the Court of Shadows to get the purple orb. Aither once again failed to convince a musteval to come with her.
* After much discussion and some false leads (stereotypes like placing the Strength orb with the Giant or Constitution with the Dwarf), Valmoc gave them a few minor hints that eventually led them to the correct solution to the orb statue puzzle. They did great, and liked it a lot!
* Ended right after the stairway downward appeared, so we'll start at Flamewind's former lair next time.
