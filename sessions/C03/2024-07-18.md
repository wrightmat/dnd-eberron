[[2-05  Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Asked Demetrius to drop them off at Darguun and pick them up at Newthrone (Q'barra).
* Start with Perception checks from everyone for the rune, then transition into the minotaur finding them (lantern starts flickering between blue and orange, and anything with a good Perception checks hears clanging of metal).

### Post-Session Write-Up

- They got the minotaur down to 98 HP before one of them (Aither) finally went down and the minotaur ran off.
- Moved on to the Giant area where they snuck around and toyed with the degenerate titan without actually fighting (or even feeding) him. Verity even created an illusion of food the fooled him.
- In the fiends area, they had more trouble with the door than they did the demon battle!
- They unpetrified Seralath and seems to latch on to him trustingly very quickly.
- The Bukavac battle was the toughest yet, where multiple people went down and back up, but it was never a TPK. Afterward, they rested with Seralath who told them that the frog monster was much smaller when he last saw it five years ago (before being petrified). He also told them about the wereabouts of the Metal Minotaur.
- Next time we start with them deciding what to do about the Metal Minotaur. They were debating whether to try and long rest in shifts, or to just head to the center and maybe try for a surprise round.
- If they don't long rest, keep the Minotaur at 98 HP (unless that ends up being too easy, in which case add more). If they long rest, reset the Minotaur HP to full. After the battle, mention that one of the Minotaur axes gives off a strong magical aura - might be useful as a vestige for Shahiri assuming Claire returns!
