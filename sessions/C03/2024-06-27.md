### Pre-Session Notes

* 

### Post-Session Write-Up

* They decided to explore the tower first. They weren't deterred by either of the people there asking them to leave, or the gargoyles who flew off, and ended up finding the paintings near the top of the tower (along with Glitter). They tried to destroy them, but didn't have much luck, so they instead decided to take them out of the tower and to the bathhouse for protection by Cyrena.
* Once the paintings were safe, they decided to face Morganna, since she was the only one they knew about. Unfortunately, they didn't know that the other hags were nearby, and they (along with Saeth) moved into the lounge after Morganna was hit the first time. So the battle was more difficult than they anticipated, especially after Morganna went invisible, and Thana eventually ended up falling unconscious. She failed her death saves and died in the lounge.
* Aither and Verity decided to pick up Thana (with Verity going invisible) and run out of the room. Since the hags couldn't see them anymore, they decided to run out the front door, hoping to get to and protect the paintings. The PCs regrouped in the bathhouse, where they laid Thana in the pool, after learning that it was magical but not magical enough to bring her to life. But Cyrena did tell them that Sylvarie once protected a magical lotus, which she may still have, if they could find her.
* The group set off for the shrine, hoping Sylvarie was there. They got inside and found the medusa in the basement, but Verity was immediately able to talk her down. So she put on a blindfold and they filled her in on what had been going on. Sylvarie handed the golden lotus over to Verity, who immediately made it into a potion for Thana.
* As they left the shrine, the hags were exiting the tower, and saw Verity. She went invisible again, and Aither slipped away running quickly to the front door. So the hags went into the shrine, thinking they were chasing them. The group gathered again in the bathhouse, where Verity administered the potion to Thana, who immediately woke up (from a nice memory with her mee-maw giving her a candy). They asked Sylvarie if she knew how to destroy the paintings, which she did, and they each took a few and destroyed them (with Sylvarie destroying her own, restoring her appearance). After that, Sylvarie politely excused herself from the room, and went over to the shrine to kill all of the hags and the cambion.
* After the temple was safe, the group went around to all of the rooms and found all of the hag's victims, making sure they were safe and learning their stories. Honor and Joy both hugged Verity, and filled her in on what they remembered about their deal with the hags. After finding everyone, the whole group retired to the bathhouse where they relaxed and learned all about one another.
* Next time we'll start out with them leaving the spa (via the scroll of teleport) and arriving back in Syrania.
