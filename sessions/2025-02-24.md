### Pre-Session Notes:
* Go over first few weeks of courses and extracurriculars. Give classmates and some curriculum information from [[other/Strixhaven University#Selected Course Curriculum|Selected Course Curriculum]], then ask each PC what they did with their last 3 weeks.
* Then start out with [[1-01  Strixhaven Year 1, Term 1#Week 4 Frog's the Word]]


### Post-Session Write-Up:
- Hawthorne completed his first writing assignment for the Strixhaven Star about the mimic attack - and knocked it out of the park! (even including the drawing from Shear as the artist rendition)
- Alton spent time lifting heavy things with Greta, and gained a relationship point for it.
- Shear studied some books that Urmaktok left him, in an effort to grow particular plants from seed in his room (which Hawthorne doesn't seem super excited about).
- Mina got to know Greta better at work, and played some little tricks on Aurora with her.
- They raced right to the frog racing, where Shear turned himself into a frog (corralled by Hawthorne) while Mina worked with the red frog with a top hat (which turned out was super intelligent, thanks to a Nat 20). Shear won the race, and they had no problem with the fight afterward.
- Everyone studied for the exam as part of their downtime, and everyone aced it except for Hawthorne. He now has to study with Verelda during any downtime prior to the next exam (Slaadi).
- For their midterm break:
	- Hawthorne went to the Biblioplex to look for yearbooks or other information about his daughter. With a Nat 20, he learned that she was in the yearbook last year (so was on campus at least up until the point the pictures were taken) and he also learned about other organizations on campus that he hadn't heard of yet: Familiar House (with all of the basic information about it), Scroll and Bones Society (with only the name and the fact that it must be secretive - nothing else), and some other third even more secret organization (the Oriq Order, but he doesn't know that yet).
	- Alton helped Hawthorne study for his next exam after flunking the last one, so Hawthorne will get advantage on his next Study check.
	- Shear thoroughly studied all of the books on plants that were left for him, so he know exactly where to find the seeds he wants (but didn't have time to get them yet)
	- Mina spent two weeks basically stalking Aurora in secret, trying to learn everything she could about her so they could become friends. She succeeded in learning everything on her card.

- TODO: Look into checks for Relationships
	- Nothing in the book, just kinda leaves it to DM fiat. So, I'm thinking something like the system below.
	- The PC decides how long the social encounter goes on, but the DM tracks the NPC's attitude (Indifferent, Hostile, Friendly) throughout the encounter. When the PC decides to end it, a single Charisma check is made. The DC is equal to 20 minus twice the existing relationship points, minus the attitude level (0 for Indifferent, -2 for Friendly, and +2 for Hostile).
		- So if the PC is chatting with someone they already have 2 relationship points with, and over the course of the conversation they get them to a Friendly disposition, then the final DC would be 14 (20 minus 4 minus 2).

- TODO: Look over level progression - I did NOT have them level up to 3.
