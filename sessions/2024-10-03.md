 [[2-08. An Irian Adventure]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Ensure they got a long rest. Then start with Thana getting stabbed in the gut with a Void Gauntlet attack.
* Have the PCs figure out what to do with all of the Celeste Noir crew by having Demetrius confront them about it. If they don't decide, he leaves for the bar (Club Starlight), and Valmoc reminds them of the other ship they know about and the captain (Prince Lorrister).
