[[2-04. Echoes of the Celestial Realm]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* News from Doc Oc:
	* Have you heard about the Brass Bards? They're all the rage across Zilargo right now. Apparently troops have been performing in all the major cities - Zolanberg, Trolanport, and Korranberg.
	* This crazy machine showed up on one of the islands in the Lhazaar Principalities, then disappeared a day later, taking three people with it!
