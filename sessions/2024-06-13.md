### Pre-Session Notes

* 

### Post-Session Write-Up

* Avoided all of the encounters in the arboretums with smart sneaking and good checks, but still got almost all of the treasure. Also found both the spellshard with the Lantern of Seeking word and the spellshard with the passphrase.
* Didn't have much trouble with the Dragonleaf Tree, due to a disastrous combination of necrotic magic and fire. The four orcs then attacked them, and they killed them all.
* When they got back outside, Gharzaak threatened them and Verity went invisible, causing Gharzaak to thunderwave them and starting initiative. They ended up taking out Gharzaak and his orcs accomplices, knocking him out with non-lethal damage. They then tied him to a tree and revived him, and Verity cast a fear spell - forcing him to give them the passphrase and some other information, such as the name and whereabouts of their boss Moar'donn.
* They then left the swamp and boarded their boat, with the spellshard in hand. Next time we'll start there.
