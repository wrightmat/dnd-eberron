[[1-05. Aerenal and Aelion]] [[1-06. Valenar and Valrok]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Verity grabbed a couple of leaves off of the modril tree for later (after learning they're deadly when consumed raw). Later made them into two doses of poison (should probably look up some mechanics).
* Didn't have any problem with the dungeon puzzles generally, and **immediately** figured out the word to the book lock!
* They received the Staff of Healing from the sphinx, and Staff shapeshifted into a goblin and stole it from Thana (without her noticing).
* Asked a few questions, but mostly just received confirmation that it was the obsidian dragons who attacked. Also learned a few more details about enemy dragon tribes.
* In Valenar, Aither asked Gunnora the blacksmith for a pair of brass knuckles. These will give a +1 to her unarmed strikes.
