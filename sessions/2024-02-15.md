[[1-05. Aerenal and Aelion]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Verity grabbed a couple of leaves off of the modril tree for later (after learning they're deadly when consumed raw). Later made them into two doses of poison (should probably look up some mechanics).
* They received the Staff of Healing from the sphinx, and Staff shapeshifted into a goblin and stole it from Thana (without her noticing).
