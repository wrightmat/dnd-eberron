[[1-11. Sarlona and the Final Lair]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* Change Verity's petrification. Do a DC 10 CON save for each of four areas of the body - the head, the abdomen, the arms, and the legs. Any failures result in that part of the body being petrified.
* Any cool things from Level 6?
* If/when the players return to Sharn, Valmoc will be there at the dock waiting for them. See [[1-12. Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]] adventure and the "Attack on Morgrave University" scene.
* If the players return to Regalport to see the play, then jump to the new "Optional: The Grand Thuranni Theater" at the end of [[1-08. Lhazaar and Lirmar]].
