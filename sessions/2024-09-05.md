 [[2-07. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]] [[2-08. An Irian Adventure]]

### Pre-Session Notes

* When they get back to the ship - the head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, has sent a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.
* After they get caught up with everyone on the ship, it's attacked by topaz dragons, led by Arstyvrax. Start by rolling initiative, following the outline of the "Dragon Attack" scene in "An Irian Adventure".
* Doc Oc news: people have been talking about how Thronehold is suddenly being remodeled! It's been sitting basically vacant since the end of the Last War, so it was pretty surprising.
