### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start at Flamekeep where crowds of people have gathered for the selection of the new Keeper of the Flame - the Vocal Conflagration. The Diet of Cardinals emerge from the Cathedral of the Silver Flame, where High CardinalÂ Riathan (selected as High Cardinal after the death of Krozen) announces the name of the new Keeper.

>As you arrive in Flamekeep, the capital of Thrane, you're greeted by the towering spires of cathedrals adorned with silver and radiant flame motifs. The streets are alive with the fervor of the faithful, draped in vibrant silver and muted white. Pilgrims from distant lands join locals, filling the city with a diverse congregation. The air is charged with anticipation as whispers of the Vocal Conflagration, the sacred ritual to select a new Keeper of the Flame, echo through the cobbled streets.

>As you approach the grand Cathedral of the Silver Flame, a hallowed structure with stained glass reflecting the divine light, you witness a sea of worshippers gathered in the grand square. The crowd's collective energy seems to pulsate, driven by a shared eagerness to witness the pivotal moment in their faith.

* **Presentation of the New Keeper**

>A figure draped in resplendent vestments of silver and white stands atop the cathedral steps, overlooking the multitude. The Diet of Cardinals, each robed in their ceremonial attire, flank him on either side. Their faces, though aged, reflect unwavering devotion and spiritual authority.

>The man raises his hands, signaling for silence, and the square falls into a hush. With a voice resonating like a hymn, he addresses the faithful, "Beloved children of the Silver Flame, gathered under its radiant embrace. Today, we embark on the sacred journey of the Vocal Conflagration, a divine communion with the Voice of the Flame to choose the one who shall guide us forward."

>The High Cardinal then leads the assembled Diet in a ritual chant, invoking the Silver Flame's blessings upon the gathering. The air is charged with the collective fervor, and the cathedral bells toll in harmony with the chants.

>Amidst the rhythmic invocations, the High Cardinal approaches the central altar, where a sacred brazier burns with ethereal flame. Beside it, a ceremonial chalice rests, symbolizing the chosen vessel for the Flame's power. Riathan places his hands upon the chalice, eyes closed in communion, as if channeling the divine will.

>With a solemn reverence, he opens his eyes and addresses the people, "In the sacred dance of the Vocal Conflagration, the Silver Flame has chosen. Behold, the vessel through which its radiant will shall be channeled, Onme Nanvia Donverou!"

>The crowd erupts in a mixture of gasps and cheers, their voices echoing through the grand square. An older woman with silver hair and nearly glowing skin steps forward, clad in simple yet regal attire, a symbol of humility and divine calling. High Cardinal Riathan places a silver circlet upon her head, signifying the sacred responsibility she now bears.

>The newly anointed Keeper of the Flame raises her hands in acknowledgment, and the crowd, now jubilant, welcomes their chosen spiritual leader. The bells continue to toll, their reverberations reaching far beyond Flamekeep, marking the dawning of a new era under the guidance of Onme Nanvia Donverou, the Keeper of the Flame.

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* After observing the Vocal Conflagration in Flamekeep, the group hopped on the Lightning Rail and headed to Zolanberg. They wandered around a bit and learned about the Brass Bards show happening soon, so headed to the Copper Dragon Inn.
* During the show, Verity noticed one of the brass dragonborn working the crowd. They asked about it after the show, and the dragonborn told them how they learn information from people during the show. They also chatted with Rannik a bit, and know that's he's cagey at best and may be hiding something.
* Chatted with the bartender, got a few drinks, and ended up a little drunk. They then decided to move over to the Drunken Dwarf, where they found a dwarf passed out on the floor and struck up a conversation. After a few more drinks from the bartender here, Aither (who hadn't been drinking) left to get the group a room back at the Copper Dragon Inn.
* The next morning, after sobering up, they found their way to the Shimmerwood Forest on foot. Had no trouble with the labyrinth, and actually found the center quite quickly (after discovering two of the "trap" rooms, but not encountering the monster). They got the Blue Dragon Mask from the sphinx (and were very excited about the prospect of becoming "Dragon Rangers" ala Power Rangers), as well as the UV light which they used to uncover the map and ask a few more questions of the sphinx.
* Headed back to Sharn on foot and got more money from Flamewind (1000 gp, which they split up after Verity was confronted). They also asked her why she didn't have a lair here, and learned a bit of her backstory. Next time they plan to charter (or possibly buy) a ship and head toward Aerenal.
