### Pre-Session Notes:

##### Questionnaire
Send out at the start of the session (or even before the session) so players have time to fill it out while I talk. Then review the results during the break.

##### New 2024 Rules
Lots of various changes, mostly balance-related. Review anything you want to use and don't assume it's the same!

* **Backgrounds** have been expanded and diversified, offering players greater flexibility in defining their characters' histories and skills. This change emphasizes personal backstory over inherent species (now the term used in place of race) traits. Backgrounds have two notable changes in the revised core rulebook:
	* Ability score adjustments are now tied to the background you select, rather than the species you choose.
	* Each background comes with a specific feat. Feats that can come with a background are now categorized as Origin feats.
* **Weapon Mastery** is now available to many of the martial classes such as barbarian and fighter - which is probably not as important as this is a magically-focused campaign. But I will be removing my Cleave homebrew rule, as this is now a Weapon Mastery option.
* **Unarmed Strikes** now encompass grappling and shoving actions, streamlining combat mechanics and providing more options for characters who engage in hand-to-hand combat.
	* After hitting with an Unarmed Strike, Grappling or Shoving triggers a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw from the target against a DC of (8 + the attacker’s STR + the attacker’s proficiency). On a failure, they’re successfully grappled or shoved.
* **Exhaustion** condition changed and simplified - meaning I'm more likely to use it now:
	* When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 2x your Exhaustion level. For example, if your character has Level 3 exhaustion, any D20 Tests would be reduced by -6.
	* Speed Reduced: Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5x your Exhaustion level. For example, if you have Level 4 exhaustion, your Speed would be reduced by -20 feet.
* **Bonus action potion drinking** is now a base rule. I'm keeping my homebrew rule of drinking as an action to maximize healing.
* **Crafting Rules**. Core rulebooks now provide updated rules for crafting items, including magical equipment. These rules standardize costs and processes, ensuring consistency across campaigns.
* **Spells**. Quite a few new spells - review and see if there's anything new you want to try out!

##### Strixhaven-Specific Stuff
Study at Strixhaven isn’t about learning to be a wizard but about learning to be a historian, an artist, an orator, a scientist, or some other profession — while using magic to enhance one’s studies. The university’s understanding of magic is expansive. Characters of any class can study at Strixhaven, whether they’re full-fledged spellcasters like wizards, clerics, and druids; they manage a spell or two thanks to a
subclass or feat; or they manifest magical abilities that aren’t even spells.
Magic is everywhere on campus. The campus culture encourages finding magical solutions to the most mundane problems, and if characters need access to a spell they can’t cast, they have a strong chance of finding someone who can cast it.

- **Magical College System**
	- Players are sorted into one of five colleges starting in the second year, each with unique themes and magical philosophies:
		- Lorehold - Explores the past and preserves its lessons for future generations. Also called the College of Archaeomancy.
		- Prismari - Uses the elements to practice the arts. Also called the College of Elemental Arts.
		- Quandrix - Focuses on the mathematics of nature. Also called the College of Numeromancy.
		- Silverquill - Teaches the magic of rhetoric, poetry, oration, and writing. Also called the College of Eloquence.
		- Witherbloom - Harnesses the forces of life and death. Also called the College of Essence Studies.
	- Each college provides flavor and thematic roleplay opportunities but does not impose mechanical restrictions.
* **Relationships**
	* Friendships and Rivals:
		* Players can build relationships with NPC students, which are tracked as either friendships or rivalries.
		* Each relationship has a score from -5 to +5 (up from -2 to +2 in the book), starting at 0.
		* Friendship Points (+1): Gained by helping or bonding with an NPC.
		* Rivalry Points (-1): Gained by competing with or antagonizing an NPC.
	* Relationship Thresholds:
		* At +2 (Friend), the NPC becomes an ally, providing the boon denoted on their character card.
		* At -2 (Rival), the NPC becomes hostile, creating complications in the form of the bane on their character card.
		* At +5 (Beloved), the NPC becomes even closer. This might be a romantic pairing, a deeper platonic camaraderie, or a sibling-like bond.
		* At -5 (Nemesis), the NPC becomes even more hostile. The Nemesis is driven to undermine or harm the character, escalating tensions and creating memorable conflict.
	* Boons and Banes: Allies and rivals can influence certain events or provide bonuses/penalties during exams or adventures.
		* When a character has a Beloved, the character gains Beloved Inspiration at the end of each long rest. Beloved Inspiration functions like Heroic Inspiration, except a character regains a number of uses of Beloved Inspiration after each long rest equal to the number of Beloveds they have, not to exceed a number equal to their proficiency bonus.
		* When a character has a Nemesis, the character loses one Heroic Inspiration at the end of each long rest. This can be Heroic Inspiration derived from a Beloved (negating Beloved Inspiration), or from another source such as the Human species trait.
- **Exams**
	- Exams occur at regular intervals during the campaign, simulating the academic challenges of Strixhaven.
	- Each exam consists of two skill checks:
		- A Study Check (completed during downtime) where players prepare for the exam by choosing a relevant skill to roll against a DC, which they can make only once. Success on the Study Check grants advantage on the Exam Check.
		- An Exam Check (rolled during the exam session) using skills tied to the subject matter.
			- Both Checks Succeed: Pass with flying colors and gain Inspiration or other rewards.
			- One Check Succeeds: Pass and gain modest rewards.
			- Both Checks Fail: Fail the exam, leading to minor consequences (e.g., a damaged reputation or increased rivalry scores).
		- Pulling an All-Nighter. 
After pulling an all-nighter, a character gains two
rerolls to use during the next Testing phase if the
character succeeds on the ability check. Doing so
imposes a cost: the character gains 1 level of exhaustion
that takes effect at the start of the day of
the Exam. This level of exhaustion can’t be removed
until after the Exam.
- **Extracurricular Activities**
	- Players can join up to two extracurriculars, such as clubs or sports teams. While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a Student Die and a Relationship Point.
	- Each character gains one Student Die for each Extracurricular they are participating in. A Student Die is a d4 the player can roll and add to an ability check that the character makes, provided the check uses one of the skills listed in the Extracurricular’s description.
	- While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain either a positive or a negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC who is also a member of the Extracurricular.
	- Characters can quit an Extracurricular at any time, updating their tracking sheet accordingly. When a student quits an Extracurricular, they immediately lose its benefits.
- **Jobs**
	- A student who works a Job gains 5 gp at the start of each week that they hold the Job. If a student quits during the academic year, they stop earning this money at the end of the week in which they quit.
	- While a character works a Job, they gain a positive or negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC at that Job. This represents a coworker with whom the character is often scheduled and with whom they can easily form a connection.
- **Campus and NPC Events**
	- The book encourages the DM to weave in campus events, from magical pranks to festive celebrations.
	- Events provide opportunities for characters to roleplay, engage with NPCs, and further their goals.
	- The campaign includes a diverse cast of NPC students and professors, each with unique personalities and quirks. I will be using a card-based system to select which NPCs are present in various locations as needed.

##### Miscellany

- For character creation, I encourage you to explore unique magic users and sources of magic from Eberron (such as dragonmarks) - let's have some fun exploring magic!
- You can use the Owlin species from the book if you'd like, but don't use the backgrounds or feats from the book, as they're too specific to the colleges. I will likely grant or at least allow a feat from your selected college after year two.
- Think specifically about your character's motivation or goal(s) - in other words, why are you at Strixhaven?
- I do intent this to be a roleplay heavy campaign. You'll have more opportunity to gain benefits from inspiration and other sources, but you'll likely be asked to play out a scene in order to gain this benefit. For example, student may choose to study together in order to gain advantage via the Help action, but I'll ask you to play out what this study session looks like.

##### Break
Use this time to review the survey, compile the results, and transfer information to the players' note pages.

##### Character Roundtable
Go around the table and ask about each of the players' characters. Answer any questions they may have. Gather the below information and use it to create their PC note page.

- Name
- Gender and pronouns
- Species
- Class
- Background (and Origin feat)
- Motivation / Goal(s)
- Where are you from?
- Any relationships you have - such as family?

##### Introductions
If enough time remains (at least an hour), go ahead and start the [[1-00  Session One Intros|Session One Intros]].
