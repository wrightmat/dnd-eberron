### Pre-Session Notes:

##### Questionnaire
Send at the start of the session so players have time to fill it out while I talk. Then review the results during the break.

##### New 2024 Rules
Lots of various changes, mostly balance-related. Review anything you want to use and don't assume it's the same!

* **Backgrounds** have been expanded and diversified, offering players greater flexibility in defining their characters' histories and skills. This change emphasizes personal backstory over inherent species (now the term used in place of race) traits. Backgrounds have two notable changes in the revised core rulebook:
	* Ability score adjustments are now tied to the background you select, rather than the species you choose.
	* Each background comes with a specific feat. Feats that can come with a background are now categorized as Origin feats.
* **Weapon Mastery** is now available to many of the martial classes such as barbarian and fighter - which is probably not as important as this is a magically-focused campaign. But I will be removing my Cleave homebrew rule, as this is now a Weapon Mastery option.
* **Unarmed Strikes** now encompass grappling and shoving actions, streamlining combat mechanics and providing more options for characters who engage in hand-to-hand combat.
	* After hitting with an Unarmed Strike, Grappling or Shoving triggers a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw from the target against a DC of (8 + the attacker’s STR + the attacker’s proficiency). On a failure, they’re successfully grappled or shoved.
* **Exhaustion** condition changed and simplified - meaning I'm more likely to use it now:
	* When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 2x your Exhaustion level. For example, if your character has Level 3 exhaustion, any D20 Tests would be reduced by -6.
	* Speed Reduced: Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5x your Exhaustion level. For example, if you have Level 4 exhaustion, your Speed would be reduced by -20 feet.
* **Bonus action potion drinking** is now a base rule. I'm keeping my homebrew rule of drinking as an action to maximize healing.
* **Crafting Rules**. Core rulebooks now provide updated rules for crafting items, including magical equipment. These rules standardize costs and processes, ensuring consistency across campaigns.
* **Spells**. Quite a few new spells - review and see if there's anything new you want to try out!

##### Strixhaven-Specific Rules
Study at Strixhaven isn’t about learning to be a wizard but about learning to be a historian, an artist, an orator, a scientist, or some other profession — while using magic to enhance one’s studies. The university’s understanding of magic is expansive. Characters of any class can study at Strixhaven, whether they’re full-fledged spellcasters like wizards, clerics, and druids; they manage a spell or two thanks to a
subclass or feat; or they manifest magical abilities that aren’t even spells.
Magic is everywhere on campus. The campus culture encourages finding magical solutions to the most mundane problems, and if characters need access to a spell they can’t cast, they have a strong chance of finding someone who can cast it.

- **Magical College System**
	- Players are sorted into one of five colleges starting in the second year, each with unique themes and magical philosophies:
		- Lorehold - Explores the past and preserves its lessons for future generations. Also called the College of Archaeomancy.
		- Prismari - Uses the elements to practice the arts. Also called the College of Elemental Arts.
		- Quandrix - Focuses on the mathematics of nature. Also called the College of Numeromancy.
		- Silverquill - Teaches the magic of rhetoric, poetry, oration, and writing. Also called the College of Eloquence.
		- Witherbloom - Harnesses the forces of life and death. Also called the College of Essence Studies.
	- Each college provides flavor and thematic roleplay opportunities but does not impose mechanical restrictions.
* **Relationships**
	* Friendships and Rivals:
		* Players can build relationships with NPC students, which are tracked as either friendships or rivalries.
		* Each relationship has a score from -2 to +2, starting at 0.
		* Friendship Points (+1): Gained by helping or bonding with an NPC.
		* Rivalry Points (-1): Gained by competing with or antagonizing an NPC.
	* Relationship Thresholds:
		* At +2 Friendship, the NPC becomes an ally, providing benefits like guidance or assistance during downtime.
		* At -2 Rivalry, the NPC becomes hostile, creating complications for the character.
	* Boons and Banes: Allies and rivals can influence certain events or provide bonuses/penalties during exams or adventures.
- **Exams**
	- Exam Process:
		- Exams occur at regular intervals during the campaign, simulating the academic challenges of Strixhaven.
		- Each exam consists of two skill checks:
			- A Study Check (completed during downtime) where players prepare for the exam by choosing a relevant skill to roll against a DC.
			- An Exam Check (rolled during the exam session) using skills tied to the subject matter.
		- Success in the Study Check grants advantage on the Exam Check.
	- Results:
		- Both Checks Succeed: Pass with flying colors and gain Inspiration or other rewards.
		- One Check Succeeds: Pass and gain modest rewards.
		- Both Checks Fail: Fail the exam, leading to minor consequences (e.g., a damaged reputation or increased rivalry scores).
- **Extracurricular Activities**
	- Players can join up to two extracurriculars, such as clubs or sports teams.
	- Each activity grants a specific benefit, such as proficiency in a skill or a bonus to ability checks in certain situations.
	- Participation influences relationships with other students and provides additional roleplay opportunities.
- **Jobs**
	- Characters can take part-time jobs for extra gold and opportunities to strengthen relationships.
	- Each job requires a weekly ability check (e.g., Athletics for Groundskeeping or Arcana for Library Assistant).
	- Success may yield bonuses like extra study time or relationship points.
- **Campus and NPC Events**
	- The book encourages the DM to weave in campus events, from magical pranks to festive celebrations.
	- Events provide opportunities for characters to roleplay, engage with NPCs, and further their goals.
	- The campaign includes a diverse cast of NPC students and professors, each with unique personalities and quirks. I will be using a card-based system to select which NPCs are present in various locations as needed.

##### Miscellany

- For character creation, I encourage you to explore unique magic users and sources of magic from Eberron (such as dragonmarks) - let's have some fun exploring magic!
- You can use the Owlin species from the book if you'd like, but don't use the backgrounds or feats from the book, as they're too specific to the colleges. I will likely grant or at least allow a feat from your selected college after year two.
