  - name: Devour Sanity (1/Day).
    desc: "The shade whispers dissonantly at a target humanoid that is within 20 feet of it that can hear it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target protects it, as does a magic circle. The target has dreadful thoughts as long as it is not deafened. If these thoughts last for at least 8 hours, the target gains a flaw from the indefinite madness table (see pg. 258 of the DMG). Only a greater restoration spell or more powerful magic can rid a character of indefinite madness."
```

These shadow beings tend to take on a form that's most resonant to its target, to ensure that it can frighten it to the most extreme level.
