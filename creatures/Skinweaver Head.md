### Skinweavers

No corpse is wasted in Mordain’s domain. The skinweaver builds webs from skin and muscle, stretching entrails between trees and bones in a grotesque mockery of a spider. Heads and hands become hosts for the foul creatures’ spawn. Some might assume that skinweavers could be created only from the bodies of warlocks or wizards, but the arcane powers of these creatures are instinctual; thanks to Mordain’s twisted skills, a fighter’s head can also cast spells in the Forest of Flesh.

Although skinweavers can induce decomposition, a skinweaver head can also produce a clear mucus that preserves flesh. This has an effect similar to gentle repose, and it preserves the creatures’ webs. Most skinweavers work in the midst of a network of vile strands, which are treated as difficult terrain. A skinweavers forest walk allows it to ignore its own webs.

Skinweavers are formed from the severed hands and heads of humanoid beings. The flesh is perfectly preserved, and a skinweaver head can even be beautiful- until one takes a closer look. The heads have six spindly, chitinous legs protruding from the sides of the skull and two smaller foreclaws, with a spiderlike abdomen sealing the base of the neck. A skinweaver hand is severed beneath the wrist and mounted on an armored body similar to that of a scorpion, with the hand in place of the scorpion’s tail. Skinweaver flesh is far tougher than that of the original humanoid, and these creatures can take a surprising amount of damage.

Skinweaver hands are psychically bound to a particular skinweaver head, and they act with perfect, silent coordination. If a skinweaver group is present, determine initiative only for the heads; the hands act on the same phase as their linked head. If a skinweaver head is killed, its linked hands immediately focus their attacks on the killer and continue to fight until slain. If the hands survive, they seek a new head with which to bond. Skinweavers do not employ any language, but the heads are excellent mimics and repeat phrases said around them in battle.

#### Skinweaver Hand Tactics

Skinweaver webs create patches of rough terrain, but the skinweavers can ignore these webs due to forest walk. The hands use their mobility to keep their distance from an opponent, relying on ranged attacks. Occasionally one hand uses stealth to ambush a party, launching a preemptive choking attack against a lightly armored caster while the head and hands strike from a distance.

#### Skinweaver Head Tactics

Merely moving close to a skinweaver head causes a creature’s flesh to crawl. A head uses existing obstacles and its disgusting mucus web to hold enemies at bay, which allows its hands to strike from afar. If an enemy uses an arcane power against the skinweavers, a head can mimic the spell in the caster’s own voice, flinging the power back against the party. Though a skinweaver head appears to display intelligence through its actions, it does not speak and instead mockingly mimics speech it hears.
