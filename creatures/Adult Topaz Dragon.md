    desc: Multiattack. The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Desiccating Breath (Recharge 5–6). The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature’s weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t weakened.
