_This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall. It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady eyes gleam out through the skull’s sockets. It hefts its spear and shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack._

While most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can’t be ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe’s trapsmiths, particularly evident in their springspike shields.

**Living Legend**. A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe’s greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force.
