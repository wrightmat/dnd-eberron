    desc: "If the skitterhaunt damages a Medium or smaller beast, it can try to infest it as a bonus action. The damaged creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. If the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0, the skitterhaunt has devoured the creature’s insides and the affected becomes a skitterhaunt, retaining its outward shell but replacing its flesh with skitterhaunt ooze."

_This large vermin moves erratically, leaking noxious fluid from its cracked exoskeleton._

**Ooze Vermin**. This parasitic ooze lives in the shells of monstrous vermin, such as scorpions and spiders, that it has infested and killed. A skitterhaunt creature might be mistaken for its original, living version at a glance, but the sluggish, erratic movements and oozing carapace of skitterhaunts quickly reveal their true nature.

**Wide Range of Prey**. A skitterhaunt infection can decimate whole nests of vermin. When those are in short supply, these oozes move on to prey on other species, such as ants, crabs, tosculi, and sometimes even zombies or reptiles.

**Hosts Required**. Skitterhaunts can’t survive long outside their host creatures; they quickly liquefy and lose their cohesion. A body abandoned by a skitterhaunt is an eerie, hollowed-out husk with a strong, acidic odor.
