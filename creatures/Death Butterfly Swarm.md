traits:
  - name: Potent Poison.
    desc: "The death butterfly swarm’s poison affects corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison."
  - name: Swarm.
    desc: "The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit point."
  - name: Weight of Wings.
    desc: "A creature in a space occupied by the death butterfly swarm has its speed reduced by half, and must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded. Both effects end when the creature doesn’t share a space with the swarm at the end of the creature’s turn. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to the swarm’s blindness (but not the speed reduction) for 24 hours."
actions:
  - name: Multiattack.
    desc: "The swarm makes a Bite attack against every target in its spaces."
  - name: Bites.
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., every target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 22 (6d6 +1) piercing damage, or 11 (3d6 + 1) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target also takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and prevents the poisoned condition."
