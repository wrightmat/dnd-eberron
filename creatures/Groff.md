    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become engulfed by the groff. While engulfed, the target can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. When the groff moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The groff can have only one target engulfed at a time. An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space."
