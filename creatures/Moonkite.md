It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled. In addition, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would banish it from its current plane or that would bind it to a particular location or creature. The moonkite can grant this trait to anyone riding it."

_This fantastic creature is almost uniformly circular in shape, its bizarre form composed of six pairs of bright silver hawk wings flapping in perfect unison. Despite its odd appearance, the creature moves gracefully through the air._

**Ordered Forms**. The circular bodies of these bizarre, spherical celestials are surrounded by six identical wings of burnished silver. Many angels like devas and planetars see moonkites as the perfect unity of form and function, and often extol their virtues to mortals when trying to convince them of the grandeur of the heavens. Moonkites themselves rarely communicate, but when they do, their wings vibrate in time with their words.

**Heavenly Steeds**. Though most celestials do not ride mounts nor use creatures like pegasi and unicorns as steeds, moonkites sometimes serve as mounts for powerful celestial generals and heroes, especially those that do not possess a humanoid form. The moonkite can outfly most other creatures, and it is particularly hardy against the powers of demons and devils, making it a valuable mount to many celestials. Celestials riding a moonkite never treat it as a lesser creature, instead often confiding in the moonkite or asking for its opinion.

**Gifts from Above**. When the world is in dire peril from a powerful chaotic or evil threat, moonkites have been known to assist good-aligned heroes as steeds. Any mortal that gains a moonkite as an ally must uphold the tenets of truth, heroism, and generosity, lest it lose the celestial’s assistance.

**Immortal Nature**. The moonkite doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.
