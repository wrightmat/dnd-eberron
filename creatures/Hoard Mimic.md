    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the mimic adheres to the target. A creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage."
  - name: Caustic Mist (Recharge 5–6).
    desc: "The mimic sprays a fine mist of acid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.

  - name: Shapechanger.
    desc: "The mimic transforms into a hoard or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies."
```

Kin to the common mimic described in the _Monster Manual_, hoard mimics are among the oldest and most cunning of their kind. A hoard mimic's massive, amorphous form and shape-shifting prowess allow it to take on the semblance of a vast trove of treasures, not just a single object. Like smaller mimics, hoard mimics exude adhesive goo to trap prey. They can also vent a fine, caustic mist from their pores that burns and blinds creatures caught in it.

Hoard mimics are so named because many enter into partnerships with dragons, each one serving as a false hoard in a dragon's lair to draw unwitting intruders away from the real riches — and into the mimic's maw. If faced with unexpectedly fierce opposition, though, a hoard mimic might offer information about the true hoard in exchange for its life.
