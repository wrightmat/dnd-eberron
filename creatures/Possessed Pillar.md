_This ancient animal-headed pillar is engraved with weathered symbols from ancient empires._

**Animal Headed**. Possessed pillars are carved from enormous blocks of stone to look like animal-headed gods of ancient pantheons, or sometimes demonic figures of zealous cults. The most common are the jackal-faced and the ibis-headed variants, but pillars with baboon, crocodile, elephant, or hawk heads also exist.

**Hijacked by Cults**. Some such pillars are claimed by various cults, and carved anew with blasphemous symbols or smeared with blood, oils, and unguents as sacrificial offerings.

**Weapon Donations**. Priests claim the weapons stolen by the pillars and distribute them to temple guards or sell them to fund temple activities.
