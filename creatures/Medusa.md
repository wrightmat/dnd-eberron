While turning to stone, a creature’s speed is reduced by 10 feet and they have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws.

If a creature who is turning to stone and dazed in this way is targeted by this action again and fails their save, they are petrified and can no longer make saving throws to end the effects of Stone Gaze. The petrification lasts until the creature is restored by a cure ailment power of 4th order or higher, a greater restoration spell, or a similar supernatural effect."

Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, few creatures are as underestimated and misunderstood as medusas. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god — but while some medusas embrace wickedness, others simply fight for their lives against ignorant hunters.

**Cursed for Defiance**. When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, the deity may curse them to live as a medusa. The offender’s skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.
The gods who use this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude — or to places haunted by creatures who don’t judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories.

**Warriors for Good or Ill**. Though they might be secluded, medusas rarely stay idle. Many plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of victims who foolishly hunted or harmed them.

**Serpentine Reflexes**. While the medusa’s stone gaze is legendary, they also can move and strike as swiftly as a snake. This enhanced dexterity makes them incredible archers, and most prefer to fight at range.

**Lifting the Curse**. The deity who inflicted a medusa’s curse can rarely be convinced to lift the punishment, usually by undertaking an impossible task in the god’s name or making a threat they can’t ignore. Some sages claim ancient rituals can undo a god’s curse, but these lost secrets are hidden by wrathful divine servants — and performing such a ritual would almost certainly entail great sacrifice.

> [!info] Dazed
A dazed creature can only do one of the following things on their turn: move, use an action, or use a bonus action.
>
If a creature becomes dazed during their turn, their turn ends. The cure ailment power, lesser restoration spell, and greater restoration spell remove the dazed condition. At the GM’s discretion, other powers, spells, or effects might also remove the dazed condition.
>
When a dazed creature is affected by a spell or effect that gives them an extra action on their turn (like the haste spell or the fighter’s Action Surge feature), they can still take this extra action, in addition to the movement, action, or bonus action allowed by the dazed condition.

#### Medusa Lairs

Medusas find privacy and solace in the shadows, often occupying abandoned ruins in lonely mountains or caves with lofty ceilings. Statues of a medusa’s victims usually litter the area.

##### Lair Actions
When fighting inside their lair, a medusa can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the medusa can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the medusa can’t use the same lair action two rounds in a row:
- **Venom Shower**. Black venom rains down in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point the medusa can see within 90 feet of them. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.
- **Shadowstep**. The medusa teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.
- **Stony Wail**. The statues in the medusa’s lair scream in pain. Each enemy within 60 feet of the medusa who can hear them must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the medusa until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.
