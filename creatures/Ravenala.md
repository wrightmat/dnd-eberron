  - name: Lamenting Engulfment.
    desc: "The ravenala targets a creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the ravenala. While restrained, the creature is engulfed inside the ravenala’s trunk. The ravenala can grapple one creature at a time; grappling doesn’t prevent it from using other attacks against different targets. The restrained creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature is compelled to sing a lament of all its various mistakes and misdeeds for as long as it remains restrained. Singing prevents uttering command words, casting spells with a verbal component, or any verbal communication. The restrained creature can still make melee attacks. When the ravenala moves, the restrained creature moves with it. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ravenala."

_Ravenalas guard tropical forests and watch after local flora and fauna. Their heads are crowned by long-stemmed, green-paddled fronds and spiked seed pods, and their dangling arms end in hooked wooden talons._

**Leafy Advisors**. Tribal humanoids respect and venerate ravenelas, and sometimes seek their advice or magical aid at times of great need. Ravenalas seldom interact with other species unless approached and questioned.

**Prisoners Lamentation**. Unlike treants, ravenalas avoid physical conflict in favor of magical responses. If annoyed, they imprison hostile creatures within their trunks rather than killing or eating them. Trapped creatures must sing their own lament as they are carried off to a distant, dangerous locale.

Ravenalas grow to about 20 feet tall and can weigh 1,800 lb.
