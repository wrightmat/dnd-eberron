Each creature of Murgaxor’s choice that he can see in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t incapacitated. A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this necrotic damage."
