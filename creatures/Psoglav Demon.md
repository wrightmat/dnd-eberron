  - 1/day: greater invisibility
traits:
  - name: Magic Weapon.
    desc: "The psoglav’s weapon attacks are magical."
  - name: Shadow Door (4/Day).
    desc: "The psoglav has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some dim light. The shadow door can span a maximum of 90 feet."

  - name: Bite.
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage."
  - name: Shadow Stealing Ray (Recharge 5-6).
    desc: "The psoglav emits a beam from its single eye. One target within 60 feet of the psoglav is hit automatically by the ray. The target is knocked 20 feet back and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. The target’s shadow stays in the space the target was originally in, and acts as an undead shadow under the command of the psoglav demon. If the creature hit with the shadow stealing ray flees the encounter, it is without a natural shadow for 1d12 days before the undead shadow fades and the creature’s natural shadow returns. The undead shadow steals the body of its creature of origin if that creature is killed during the encounter; in that case, the creature’s alignment shifts to evil and it falls under the command of the psoglav. The original creature regains its natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain. A creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it every time it is hit."

_An immense creature sniffs at the air. Most of its head is covered by a helmet from which one baleful eye gazes out. Its muzzle fuses flesh and machinery, and sharp metal teeth glint from under its lips._

**Paid in Souls and Memories**. These demonic creations are bred for protection, which they provide for a select few. The price for their guardianship is always high, and never in coin. Their Abyssal breeders demand everything from memories to souls in exchange for their services.

**Fond of Trophies**. Psoglav demons carry recent kills along with them as grisly toys, and often wear strings of scalps or ears as trophies. They do not mind the stench, and they enjoy gnawing bones as a pastime, the larger and more durable the better. Psoglav demons suffer no ill effects from bright light, but they far prefer dappled shadow or full darkness.

**Helmet Totems**. Speculation about what a psoglav keeps under its helmet is rampant. Some believe they keep stolen shadows and souls there, others that their helmets are part of a leash held by their breeders — and if the helmet were ever removed, one would not only see the demon’s brains, but also release it from servitude to its demonic lord or summoner. Psoglav demons without a helmet are rare but extremely dangerous.
