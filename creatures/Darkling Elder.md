### Description

A wise and respected darkling can undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, channeling away some of the darkling’s absorbed light. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a taller, elf-like form. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.
