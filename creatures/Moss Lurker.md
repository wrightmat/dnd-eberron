_Somewhat like the cruel crossbreed of troll and gnome, the moss lurkers are a primitive race of forest and cavern dwellers with long, greenish beards and hair. Their hides are mossy green or peaty amber, and a vaguely fungal scent surrounds them at all times._

Like their trollish relatives, moss lurkers have large and often grotesque noses. Their claws are bright red when unsheathed, and their teeth tend toward the long and snaggly. They wear simple clothes of homespun wool or leather, or go naked in the summer. Their hats are sometimes festooned with toadstools or ferns as primitive camouflage.

**Rocks and Large Weapons**. Moss lurkers have a fondness for throwing stones onto enemies from a great height, and they often employ enormous axes, warhammers, and two-handed swords that seem much larger than such a small creature should be able to lift.
