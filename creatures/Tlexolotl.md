### Description

Tlexolotls are gigantic, salamander-like creatures that slumber deep in the magma of dormant volcanoes. A tlexolotl drowses amid the molten depths for centuries, rising only rarely to gorge itself on massive amounts of animal and plant life before returning to its slumber. Should a tlexolotl’s sleep be disturbed—whether by intruders in its volcanic lair or the eruption of its molten home—the lava-drenched brute emerges in a rage, rampaging forth until its belly is full and its volcano is quiet once more.

Despite a tlexolotl’s destructive prowess, the land around its volcano is often naturally abundant. It’s common for those who live nearby to honor the tlexolotl as a protector of the land, as the ash it creates rejuvenates the soil and encourages life to flourish.
