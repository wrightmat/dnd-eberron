Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born in Mabar or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace Mabar for its bleak landscapes and desolation. Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.

_**Dark Portals.**_ Portals to Mabar manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.

_**Recast in Shadow.**_ The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon’s scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.

The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for Mabar, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. Mabar also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane’s malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on Mabar, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.

_**Back in the World.**_ A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of Mabar that even a return to the Material Plane can’t undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to Mabar to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave Mabar behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in the Material Plane.
