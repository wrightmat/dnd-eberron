From carved knife grips to chanted meditation verses, art in Adar often serves a dual purpose. It's also very personal. People in Adar take time to do their tasks. They make beautiful and intricate jewelry and armor, personalized carvings to hang over a house door (which aids in knowing the residents), and even multi-colored crystal windows for their temples. Beauty is always coupled with functionality. A golden roof on a temple not only shows reverence, but it also never tarnishes. A mural not only recalls the past or reveres an ancient master of the Path of Light, but it also beautifies and seals the stone.</p> <p>A popular art form in Adar is \"earth painting.\" Such works, made of colored earth, are often group efforts and are usually stylized images of intertwining lines of color. The paintings are created in a ritualized and meditative way. Intended to be impermanent, such paintings are at once the product of contemplation and creation.</p> <p>While storm winds howl, the warm hearth provides a place to gather and create. It's also where stories are told and dances performed. Adaran tales tend toward morality plays, extolling wisdom and survival. Their folk dances are group affairs involving rings of people switching partners or couples dancing in time with one another.</p> <p>Buildings in Adar are made out of stone, with wood used for roofs. Built to withstand the wind, precipitation, and trembling earth, houses are usually broad and low with sharply slanted sides. To an Aundairian, Adaran living spaces would seem cramped, but a native of Adar values a house that lasts more than she does a high ceiling. Adarans take care and time to personalize their dwellings \u2014 an Adaran might spend years carving designs into the walls of her home. Most houses have a central opening in the roof with another smaller roof built over it, like a small tower. Such openings allow light in and stale air out.</p> <p>Grander edifices, such as the shrines or temples that form the center of a community, are often domed. Most Adarans take pride in a well-appointed village shrine. All buildings face east when possible, or north, but Adarans never build main entrances facing south. The east invites the light and life. The north invites wealth. South is considered a direction of decay and death.</p>"},{"location":"Adar/#food-and-fashion","title":"Food and Fashion","text":"<p>Food holds a special place in Adaran life. It is a requirement for life, but it is also a mode of expression, a blessing from the spirit world, and an experience. An Adaran avoids cooking and eating when he is angry or grieving, lest his emotions taint the meal. Food is usually baked in or roasted on a clay oven built in the house, though broiling over an open fire is a common alternative. Adarans avoid using utensils. They use their hands, sometimes protected by leaves, to pick up food, intending to involve all five senses in eating. Adarans like spice. The fragrant herbs used in cooking provide taste, and many also aid digestion and fortify the body. Foreigners can find Adaran food too spicy, and Adarans often find foreign food bland.</p> <p>A wide variety of comestibles can be found on the Adaran table, from broad, woody cavern fungi to the meat of mountain sheep, from fleshy fruits to the milk of oxen and goats \u2014 along with yogurt and cheeses from this milk. Some Adarans refrain from eating meat, showing their respect for the lives of all creatures. Monasteries are often more limited in fare, due to the ruggedness of the land around them. Still, the ascetics appreciate food as a manifestation of life.</p> <p>Adarans wear loose and comfortable clothes including simple sandals when it's warm. In the cold, they layer in cloth and fur. As with all their crafts, they take the time to decorate their clothes \u2014 leather and cloth are often richly colored, and patterns of elaborate lines are woven or painted as highlights. Bright colors in individualized patterns often make it possible to tell who's coming down the ridge before that person's face can be recognized.</p> <p>Skin is a place for adornment as well. Intricate, temporary body art made with herbs provides a way to focus the mind while allowing one to share the results. Herbal paints or powders are also applied to indicate a spiritual or emotional condition or event, such as yellow for happiness or ash-gray for grief.</p> <p>The Adarans' love of craft manifests in a variety of jewelry. From glass beadwork to tiny silver plates strung together as a head covering, Adar ans spare no effort in producing beautiful objects to wear. They enjoy bracelets, armbands, and torcs. Rings are also favored; Adarans wear just as many rings in their ears and noses, and on their toes, as on their fingers.</p>"},{"location":"Adar/#five-things-every-adaran-knows","title":"Five Things Every Adaran Knows","text":"<ol> <li>The legend of Taratai.

To its people, Syrkarn is the promise of freedom.</p> <p>Syrkarn is an arid landscape of harsh deserts, lush grasslands, and endless steppes sloping up from the southern extent of the Sea of Rage. Its population consists of an almost equal mix of Sarlonan human clans and tribes of eneko \u2014 the mongrel ogres who trace their lineage back to the nation of Borunan.</p> <p>Though the climate and the isolated life of this land are never easy, the coastal steppes and inland savannah of Syrkarn offer limitless range for animals and agriculture. Herds of wild bison and domesticated goats, deer, and horses roam the grasslands, while cultivated fields of oat grass and flax spread across the Itzaina plains and the steppes of the Lamecha lowlands. The natives grow a range of vegetable crops, including the gnarled root known as sepse, native to Sarlona and prized for its high nutritional value. Exotic spices found nowhere outside Sarlona thrive in the heat of the savannah, as does dreamlily. Use of the drug is rare among the Syrk humans, but the eneko (who are immune to dreamlily's narcotic effects) grow it for its medicinal value. Harvests are hard in some years, but the clans and tribes of Syrkarn know bounty more often than not.</p>"},{"location":"Syrkarn/#at-a-glance","title":"At A Glance","text":"<ul> <li>Population: 3,260,000 (44% human, 42% eneko, 12% half-giant, 1% kalashtar, 1% other)</li> <li>Area: 1,320,000 square miles</li> <li>Capital: Nderitese</li> <li>Major Settlements: Per, Gjitha, Maszani</li> <li>Environments: Temperate to tropical throughout; equatorial heat tempered by proximity to the Sea of Rage</li> <li>Highest Point: Mount Athay in the Kushtuar Hills, elevation 4,408</li> <li>National Motto: None</li> <li>Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Fernia, Risia, and especially Lamannia are found throughout this land. Like all of Sarlona, Syrkarn is beset by storms whose force borders on the unnatural, and planar disturbances flare and flood across the steppes like unnatural wellsprings. Still, these rifts are seldom as haunting or destructive as the reality storms of the Tundra. The prominent planar connection in Syrkarn is the Whitewater, the crystal-clear lake believed to mark a manifest zone linked to Lamannia. The rocky land surrounding the area remains wet and cool year-round, even as the sands that give the lake its name burn white beneath the equatorial sun.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Syrkarn/#religion-and-culture","title":"Religion and Culture","text":"<p>Derived as it is from Riedran refugees and their descendants, Syrkarn's human population is uniformly contemptuous of the Path of Inspiration. Nearly half of all human Syrks follow no gods at all, instead placing their faith and devotion in the land itself. For Syrk clerics, the spirit of Syrkarn is treated as a neutral force that provides access to the Animal, Healing, Plant, Sun, and Travel domains. Its favored weapon is the sickle.</p> <p>In much of Syrkarn, humans have reclaimed the worship of the Sovereign Host from contact with Lhaazarites. At the same time, the eneko have always invoked aspects of Arawai and Balinor, naming these Rowa of the Enduring Trees and Banor the Bowhunter. Human Syrks thus focus their own worship on Arawai and Balinor, with this accidental meeting of traditions underpinning the long-term social stability in the region.</p>"},{"location":"Syrkarn/#art-and-architecture","title":"Art and Architecture","text":"<p>A nation of farmers and hunters would seem an unlikely place to seek the highest artistic traditions of an empire. Syrkarn is the only place where the legacy of ancient Sarlona still lives \u2014 a legacy that spreads through Syrk culture on every level.</p> <p>The cloaks and clothing of the Syrks are decorated with intricate line-art patterns in a style reminiscent of the architecture of ancient Sarlona. The images are created using long-lasting red and black inks created from the berries and leaves of the hardy hilp bush. Given historical Syrkarn dismissal (or outright distrust) of Riedra, the old artistic style of that land, with its flowing lines and curves, is all but unknown here.</p> <p>Because Syrkarn has never been subject to Inspired rule, it has been spared the cultural purges the Inspired used to build monolithic Riedra over the nations of old. Syrkarn is thus one of the few places in Sarlona where a significant portion of the architecture of the ancient past survives. Across this land, derelict castles stand atop wind-swept tors, their stark lines seemingly thrust up from the living rock. Where the villages of the mongrel ogres have been built on the central plazas of the ruined cities that came before them, ancient avenues and neighborhoods (called \"corners\") still radiate out through the surrounding grasslands like ghostly spokes. Along isolated mountain passes and long-lost wayroads, fortresses stand whose foundations are as solid as when they were laid two thousand years before.</p> <p>Dominated by columns, straight lines, and square arches, the architectural style of ancient Sarlona still affects this land and its people. Even the most utilitarian structures are built to a standard of stark beauty, and whether of wood or stone, are typically buttressed, arched, and reinforced to last a lifetime. The nomadic tribes are no less inventive than their brethren in Syrkarn's fixed settlements, building their mobile homes from elaborate frameworks of interlocking poles and light beams over which decorated hides are stretched and sealed.</p>"},{"location":"Syrkarn/#food-and-fashion","title":"Food and Fashion","text":"<p>Food in Syrkarn is plentiful, well spiced, and served with copious amounts of ustah \u2014 a potent liquor brewed from honey and wild berries, reportedly from an ancient ogre recipe. The demands of rural life limit the choices available to the Syrk palate, with meat, fruits, and vegetables all typically dried for storage and transport. However, Syrks treat cooking with the same reverence as their other arts, and need no excuse for a feast.</p> <p>True to Syrkarn's reputation as a land of freedom, the fashions of its people encompass an eclectic range of styles, and a remarkable artisanship can be seen in the textiles, cloth, and weaving of Syrkarn. Among both the mongrel ogres and the humans, a wild aesthetic predominates, combining utilitarian function and the simple beauty of ancient Sarlonan design. Despite their nomadic lifestyle, the half-giants of Syrkarn hold an edge over both the human clans and ogre tribes in armorsmithing and weaponry.</p>"},{"location":"Syrkarn/#development","title":"Development","text":"<ul> <li>A cult known as the Wanderers of Twilight emerged during the Second Sundering, with the mission to protect and expand the manifest zones that pervade Sarlona.
