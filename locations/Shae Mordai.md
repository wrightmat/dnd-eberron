 #location #capital  [[Aerenal]]

Shae Mordai, also known as the City of the Dead, was the seat of the Undying Court in Aerenal. The city was also the site of the largest known Irian manifest zones and it was the spiritual capital of Aerenal.

The city was made up of the temples and homes for the Deathless. The city also still holds a great (ruined) library of information on magic and the lives of every elf that has lived on Aerenal. The city was a center for arcane study and a place of worship, as well as the only place where the ritual of the undying could be performed.

### Deathless

Deathless, also known as Undying, are creatures that are no longer alive but continue to have an existence sustained by the essence of Irian and the devotion of the living.

Deathless are similar in many respects to traditional undead, but unlike undead, deathless are good creatures sustained by positive emotions and energy, whereas most undead are sustained by negative emotions and Mabaran energy. While this energy preserves the spirit, it does not preserve the body, and so most deathless appear as decayed corpses that give off bright light.

The majority of deathless still live in the ruined city of Shae Mordai. The city once held the temples where the Ritual of Transition is performed to turn elves into deathless. Since the Sundering, no new deathless have been created, and the deathless who already existed wander aimlessly.

### The Undying Court

On the island continent of Aerenal, the lines between life and death are blurred, and the living converse freely with the dead on a daily basis. The elves of Aerenal offer their prayers not to distant gods, but to their individual and common ancestors.

#### The Undying Court & The Draconic Prophecy

Some say that Aeren's journal contained not only the rituals that would come to shape elven life on Aerenal, but also a dedicated prophecy that Aeren gifted the founders of the island-nation. The myth states that this included a plan for the elves, and that that is one of the purposes of the Undying Court. Aeren's word might be a portion of to the greater Draconic Prophecy, but it may also conflict with it.

Some scholars believe that the dragons know the ultimate plans of the Undying Court, and that those plans are at odds with the Draconic Prophecy.

### The Sundering of Shae Mordai

On 20 Barrakas 1002, the topaz dragons and their powerful obsidian dragon leader, Arstyvrax, attacked and destroyed the city of Shae Mordai. No one knows their motivation, as no one had ever been successful in attacking this city before, especially with necrotic or other dark powers. Many suspect that the topaz dragons may have had help from an even more powerful outside entity.
