### Universal Properties

The sweltering heat of Fernia can be deadly to unprotected creatures, and it burns through mortal metabolisms. The following properties apply to the entire plane.

**Deadly Heat**. All regions of Fernia are subject to extreme heat (as defined in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). In some areas of particularly deadly heat, a creature without protection must make a Constitution saving throw every minute instead of every hour. In addition, all creatures gain resistance to cold damage, and a creature that is usually resistant to cold damage becomes immune to it.

**Empowered Fire**. When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals fire damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

**Fires of Industry**. A creature has advantage on ability checks using tools (such as baking with cook’s utensils, or forging an item with smith’s tools) when it incorporates Fernian flame into its action in place of mundane flame.

**Burning Bright**. Whenever a creature makes a death saving throw, it must make an additional saving throw, keeping the results of both rolls. In addition, when a creature gains a level of exhaustion, it gains an extra level; when it reduces a level of exhaustion, it reduces it by an additional level. In Fernia, whether you live or die, it’s going to happen quickly!

**Standard Time**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

### Characters

* **Phlain** (male efreeti aristocrat). Bystan’s father and Sultun of High Hearth. He smells of brimstone, and is a large handsome man made almost entirely of fire who has a deep, rolling voice that sounds like a burning bonfire.
* **Azhalar** (male efreeti aristocrat). As Sultan, Azhalar stood at the top of the social order. He had assembled the grandest armies and enjoyed displays of martial might, including exotic engines of war. His galas often involved gladiatorial matches or grand war games. Azhalar is a cruel man who was unkind to his subjects, and Phlain successfully unseated him. Azhalar is now rarely seen.
* **Shashraqa** (female efreeti aristocrat). Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall stands just below Ashalar in the social order and is determined to unseat her rival. She is cultivating the friendship of several dragons. She considers herself to be a connoisseur of art, and could take an interest in the work of an artistic adventurer.
* **Raqashtar** (male efreeti aristocrat). Pasha Raqashtar of Gold Ash is the most cosmopolitan of the efreet. He has many friends in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, and enjoys betting on the outcome of battles in Shavarath. His appetite for gambling could draw the adventurers into his orbit, as he might make a wager with another immortal about the outcome of a particular adventure — then seek to put a burning finger on the scales.
* **Brass** (female dao architect). Brass is the finest architect of the dao, and is responsible for most of the grand palaces of the efreet. She’s always intrigued by unusual architecture and has visited Sharn a few times to study the towers. She’s also celebrated for her sculptures, and has produced everything from tiny miniatures to towering colossuses, along with magical marvels that begin as the former, then transform into something far larger, like figurines of wondrous power.
* **Naja Ash** (female dao sculptor). Naja Ash sculpts fire, producing masterful artifacts and tools that channel or produce flame. She creates the majority of the azer, and she can create other elemental creatures, constructs, or unique blends between the two concepts. She’s the foremost expert on elemental binding in the multiverse, though it would take a great deal to convince her to share her knowledge with mortals.
* **Sar Saeran** (male dao blacksmith). Blacksmith who creates tools of war, from personal armor and weapons to grand siege engines. The efreeti Azhalar is his best client, but all of the efreet value his peerless work. He has spent eons trying to create the perfect sword, and often seeks out legendary blades on the Material Plane — sometimes to keep, sometimes to study for a few minutes, and sometimes to destroy.

### Locations

##### The City of Brass

The sole metropolis in Fernia, the City of Brass is the glorious city of the efreet, a place of marvels. Here, a towering statue of an efreeti holds a sphere of continual flame the size of an airship. The statue reshapes itself to match the appearance of the efreeti who currently dominates society; both the statue and whichever efreeti it depicts are known as the Sultan. Currently, the Sultan is Azhalar of High Hearth.  All efreet have mansions in the City of Brass, though at any given time, many dwell within their island estates. Likewise, there are always a few dao in residence showing off their latest creations and taking new commissions. The streets are filled with mephits and salamanders. Visiting mortals are a curiosity, but most elementals are too busy to take much time on them. The City of Brass is ringed with teleportation circles, linking it to all of the estates and major foundries.

##### Efreeti Estates

Each of the noble efreet have a sprawling palace or mansion on an island in the Sea of Fire. While not so grand as the City of Brass, these estates are studies in opulence, filled with dao-crafted wonders and sculptures of metal and flame.

**Foundries**

Foundry islands are models of industry. Some are focused primarily on physical engineering, with vast gears and wheels slowly turning, and chains rising and falling. Others reflect arcane industry, with blazing glyphs and fields of shimmering energy. Here the azers work at all hours, producing both mundane, martial, and magical goods for the efreet and their servants.

##### Deep Halls

Under the foundries, tunnels extend down below the Sea of Fire into the earth below. These are the domains of the dao. Like the foundries above them, each has a distinct style tied to the sensibilities of the dao who dwells there. Streams of lava and pools of fire run through the halls, along with veins of metal and minerals. While not as luxurious as the estates of the efreeti, these often showcase the wondrous creations of the dao in residence; adventurers could find a hall whose walls are decorated with a thousand swords, or a brass garden filled with cunning construct songbirds. But some dao are paranoid, and deep halls can also contain a host of powerful and deadly traps.

##### The Charred City

One inferno is a burning city, where devils direct bombardment and demons dance about, spreading the flames within.

##### The Flaming Forest

Another inferno contains a lone balor overseeing the devastation of an ancient forest. These fires never end; parts of the layer are rebuilt even as others are consumed, and the inferno continues forever.

##### The Lonely Campfire

This island in the Sea of Fire is a forested clearing with a single campfire, a lonely light out in the darkest wilderness.

##### The First Hearth

Another campfire layer is an inn called the First Hearth, where the angelic barkeep Ashe offers warm drinks around the fireplace from which the inn takes its name. Campfire layers are safe havens, and a perfect place for travelers to rest.
