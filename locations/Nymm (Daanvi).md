### Locations

#### The Panopticon


#### The Hall of Justice
> You enter an immense complex containing an impossible number of courts and chambers of inquiry. In smaller chambers, immortals debate the actions of the beings observed in the Panopticon. A large mechanical humanoid, wearing elaborate golden-hued banded-mail armor and a flowing red robe, is seating in the center of the chamber.

Adventurers who violate the laws of Daanvi are brought before an immortal tribunal. Usually this is a straightforward matter; the judges question the accused. The accused is granted an Advocate and opposed by a Voice of Justice; typically one of these is an angel, the other a devil. Both of these immortals may conjure images from the lives of the accused, drawing on the records gathered from the Panopticon. Once a case is decided by the Kolyarut, the inevitable tribunal enacts their judgment; this ruling is final, and can’t be questioned or appealed.

#### The Infinite Archive
Daanvi’s Infinite Archive contains records on every being that’s ever existed. Here, the data gathered by the Panopticon and the rulings of the Hall of Justice are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on each individual’s deeds, whether they’ve adhered to or violated countless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn’t generally do anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction to act on it. So through your life, the immortals of Daanvi have watched and judged your every action. You aren’t rewarded or punished for your deeds, but they know what you’ve done, and it’s forever preserved on your permanent record.

Mortals must present an excellent reason — or bribe a devil — to get access to the Archive. The Infinite Archive lives up to its name, and is unknowably vast. If adventurers have a legitimate inquiry, a deva sage can be quite helpful. Working with modrons is a long and tedious process, while devils make it even more unpleasant.

#### The Iron Ward
This city of gray stone embodies the worst aspects of oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel amnizu, wields absolute power and can’t be questioned or challenged. Most of the subjects of the ward are indentured servants, trapped in inescapable contracts; visitors must be careful not to accept any offers of work in the ward, lest they be similarly trapped. There are regular displays of brutal “justice” in the grand plaza. Imps scurry in the shadows, watching outsiders and carrying news of their actions to the chain devils and erinyes that serve as the brutal police force. While they can’t punish adventurers “unjustly,” they can tempt visitors into misconduct; fiendish merchants and patrons have many appealing offers for adventurers, but almost all would surely lead to breaking a law of the ward, obscure and ridiculous as it may be.

While the Iron Ward symbolizes the evils of oppressive order, it is driven by order. The police and councilors twist the law and weaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws — the one advantage adventurers have in passing through this place. And while the subjects of the Iron Ward are brutally oppressed, they’re largely symbolic; it’s questionable if the subjects even exist when no one’s around to observe their suffering.

#### The Inescapable Prison
Maintained by devils, this oppressive layer is the embodiment of prison — the inevitable consequence of challenging the law. With the full power of Daanvi behind it, the Inescapable Prison makes Dreadhold look like a cell in the local sheriff’s office. It’s designed to hold celestials, elementals, and other beings with vast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen planes of existence (all shackles in the prison are [[Dimensional Shackles]]). Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological processes are put in suspension, so they don’t need to eat or drink, and they don’t age.

Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Onatar traveled to Eberron as a brass dragon and gave fire to the mortals to help them through the cold winters, defying the laws of Daanvi that forbid interference with mortals races. He was removed from the rotation of rulers (which is why rule now alternates between Aureon and The Shadow) and thrown in to the Inescapable Prison. It's possible that if Onatar were somehow broken out of the prison, then he could be returned to the ruling rotation, thwarting The Shadow's plans further.

#### The Perfect Grange
The Perfect Grange is a vast, precisely maintained farm, displaying the virtues of agricultural discipline. This is a well-ordered area with pristine crops, orchards, and farming villages all laid out in regular geometric shapes. Properly shaped and arranged flowerbeds of every color are always in bloom and never need a gardener. The trees grow in straight orchard rows or tidy forests, with perfect leaves that never fall to the ground.

Underneath the perfect fields is a formian settlement (called Klictrik by the Formians but known colloquially by others as "Mandible") where immortal ant-like spirits care for their queen. The main trade post of the Perfect Grange is the district of Mercantus, the portion of the city of Mandible that is above ground. It welcomes traders and travelers to its markets and inns.

##### Mercantus, the Trading Post
The trade post of Mercantus is composed of perfectly geometrical tents, each of which normally housing a different kind of shop. But currently all of them are abandoned except for a single shop known as the Frugal Formian. It looks as though there's normally an inn of some sort, possibly a bar, and another shop of some kind.

##### The Frugal Formian
This small shop is run by a formian named Ryt'thkril, who normally lives in the main city-nest of Klictrik, but who is now sleeping in his shop (due to the recent flooding). The players would notice that Ryt'thkril looks like he hasn't slept well in days, and he speak with a slow quiet form of Common in order to portray this. If asked, he'll reluctantly tell the players about the recent issues in Klictrik (and direct them to the nearby tunnel access, should they decide they want to investigate).

### Universal Properties

The impulse toward order affects all creatures in Daanvi. It’s impossible to knowingly lie while in Daanvi, and the effects of random chance are reduced. In Daanvi, all things are inherently reliable — remarkable fortune and bad luck are equally rare.

**Plane of Truth**. A creature can’t tell a deliberate lie. It can avoid answering questions, or be evasive in its answers, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

**Impeded Illusion**. When a creature casts an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is halved.

**The Eyes of the Law**. When a creature casts a divination spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.

**No Chance**. The first time in a round (or any time outside of combat) that a creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw (other than a death saving throw), treat the roll as a 10. If the creature has advantage or disadvantage on that roll, it only rolls one die, and treats the other one as a 10.

**Flowing Time**. For every 10 minutes that pass in Daanvi, only 1 minute passes in the Material Plane. So if a creature spends 10 days arguing a case before a Daanvian court, less than a day has passed on Eberron.
