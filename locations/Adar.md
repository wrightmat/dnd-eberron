Adar is the mountainous region in southeast of Sarlona. It is inhabited mostly by humans (including the kalashtar), though there is a prominent contingent of blue dragons on the uppermost peaks.

To its inhabitants, Adar is mostly known as a refuge from the dictatorship of Riedra, and many of its residents can trace their lineage to refugees and dissidents of the Riedran state. To this day, Riedra considers Adar a danger to its enforced stability, and regularly sends troops to attack the borders of the region.

The region of Adar covers the southeastern tip of Sarlona. The region is defined by tall mountains, cliffs, and plateaus, with the majority of the land being over 12,000 feet in elevation. This includes the mountain of Korrandar, one of the tallest mountains in all of Eberron.

About 20% of the region is arable land, mainly in the valleys between the mountains. The region has a number of manifest zones to Lamannia and Kythri, the largest being Ahdryatmin in the center of Adar.

### Locations

#### Monasteries
Eight monasteries act as fortresses and form a defensive ring around Adar. With the exception of Kasshta Keep, the true locations of these monasteries are kept hidden from outsiders.

* **Dvaarnava**. Located on the southernmost tip of Adar, but hidden from outsiders. While most of Adar's coastline is sheer cliffs, ships can dock at Dvaarnava by traveling past a maze of stone spires into a natural cavern in the cliffs. Most of the population of Dvaarnava live in grottoes farther up the cliffs to be safe from the stormy waters.
* **Ghoza**. Like the other monasteries in Adar, Ghoza's true location is hidden. However it is known to be located on the eastern part of Adar along the Jathara Sound, just south of a wide point in the sound known as Kasshta's Belly. Ghoza is built high in the cliffs near the sound, however it also controls underground caverns that can reach Kasshta's Belly through underwater grottos.
* **Haztaratain**. Carved into a mountainside on the eastern side of Adar close to the coast (within 50 miles of Corvagura), its exact location is hidden from outsiders. It is famous for being the birthplace of the kalashtar, and is a major pilgrimage site for followers of the Path of Light. The Haztaratain monks train at the monastery and often re-gather there on the spring equinox.
* **Kasshta Keep**. Lies on the border of Adar and Syrkarn, carved into a mountain thousands of feet above the waters of the Kasshta River. The only ways to access the Keep are by eastern trails that lead to the Keep's gate, or by magical winches that can lift boats up from the river to an artificial mountain lake. The Keep is often enshrouded by storms and strange mists. The Keep is the original stronghold of the Keepers of the Word. Elders from that organization's Council of the Wise oversee the day to day operations of the Keep. The keep is also the dwelling place of Speaker of the Word, Adar's spiritual leader.
	* The **Council Chambers** in the highest parts of Kasshta Keep are where the most respected elders live and work. It is also the meeting place of the Council of the Wise.
* **Malshashar**. Its true location is a closely guarded secret, especially as it is one of the fortresses guarding Adar's border, but it is located in northern Adar deep in the eastern parts of the Ahnadiv Mountains. The area around the monastery are prone to storms and landslides. The core sections of the monastery are underground beneath a single mountain peak, but a few sections sprawl out under neighboring mountains. Due to the secrecy and the harsh environment, even the food is grown underground.
* **Ruukosi**. The monastery is built on the western side of Adar, into the cliffs on either side of the mouth of the Ruukosi River, where it enters the Jathara Sound. The two halves of the monastery are connected by a natural arch over the river, which has been hollowed out into a lookout post, that can see as far as Syrkarn on a good day.
* **Shalquar**. This monastery lies in northern Adar among the Ahnadiv Mountains, only 22 miles from the village of Hillcorn in Pyrine. Its exact location is kept secret, but its general location is known even to outsiders. The monastery itself is built into two mountains, and guards a narrow pass between them, the only accessible route into Adar in the local area. This monastery was destroyed in 1051 YK by a topaz dragon attack which Aither Lightwood witnessed.
* **Tashalatora**. Its true location is a closely guarded secret, but it is located somewhere in northeastern Adar overlooking Vulpana Falls. The monastery guards one of the only accessible passages into Adar from Corvagura for hundreds of miles.

#### Other Settlements

* **Xephanan**. Capital city of the xephs, located a little south of the central part of Adar. The city lies in a forested canyon valley known as the Xaryai Coulee, named for the Xaryai River that flows through it. The city is lit by luminescent crystals that naturally occur in the rock of the canyon. The xephs see some trade with the closest monastery of Ruukosi, while other xeph merchants run ships out of the port of Dvaarnava.
* **Zi'til'natek**. A dromite hive, located deep underground beneath the site of Malshashar monastery in Adar. Psionic portals connect the monastery with the hive. Zi'til'natek is an ancient city thought to be the origins of dromite civilization in Sarlona. In 703 AT (-99 YK), the kalashtar of Adar convinced the dromites of Zi'til'natek to ally with them against the Inspired of Riedra. The dromites allowed the kalashtar to place a shroud resonator in a cavern near their city after the destruction of the first Malshashar monastery. The dromites continue to maintain this alliance to the present day, trading with Adar through the psionic portals that connect the hive with the monastery. When the Summit Road was established, Zi'til'natek was the initial route used by guides to get out of Adar and to get Riedran refugees into Adar. The Summit Road continues to have cells operating in the hive today.

### Religion and Culture

Traditional Adaran prayers call on Braahyn (Balinor), the god of the wilds and the moving earth, and his spouse Aarakti (Arawai), the goddess of abundance and storms. Many people also respect the spirits of nature and those of their ancestors. Some adherents to the old Path of Light may still remain in Adar.

Adaran people live modestly. Mountainfolk and monks alike see craft as a leisure activity, and the precepts of the Path of Light had reinforced this custom for over a millennium. Adaran crafts are usually functional, and they are always products of care.

### Art and Architecture

Adaran art is more craft than fine art. From carved knife grips to chanted meditation verses, art in Adar often serves a dual purpose. It's also very personal. People in Adar take time to do their tasks. They make beautiful and intricate jewelry and armor, personalized carvings to hang over a house door (which aids in knowing the residents), and even multi-colored crystal windows for their temples. Beauty is always coupled with functionality. A golden roof on a temple not only shows reverence, but it also never tarnishes. A mural not only recalls the past or reveres an ancient master of the Path of Light, but it also beautifies and seals the stone.

A popular art form in Adar is "earth painting." Such works, made of colored earth, are often group efforts and are usually stylized images of intertwining lines of color. The paintings are created in a ritualized and meditative way. Intended to be impermanent, such paintings are at once the product of contemplation and creation.

While storm winds howl, the warm hearth provides a place to gather and create. It's also where stories are told and dances performed. Adaran tales tend toward morality plays, extolling wisdom and survival. Their folk dances are group affairs involving rings of people switching partners or couples dancing in time with one another.

Buildings in Adar are made out of stone, with wood used for roofs. Built to withstand the wind, precipitation, and trembling earth, houses are usually broad and low with sharply slanted sides. To an Aundairian, Adaran living spaces would seem cramped, but a native of Adar values a house that lasts more than she does a high ceiling. Adarans take care and time to personalize their dwellings — an Adaran might spend years carving designs into the walls of her home. Most houses have a central opening in the roof with another smaller roof built over it, like a small tower. Such openings allow light in and stale air out.

Grander edifices, such as the shrines or temples that form the center of a community, are often domed. Most Adarans take pride in a well-appointed village shrine. All buildings face east when possible, or north, but Adarans never build main entrances facing south. The east invites the light and life. The north invites wealth. South is considered a direction of decay and death.

### Food and Fashion

Food holds a special place in Adaran life. It is a requirement for life, but it is also a mode of expression, a blessing from the spirit world, and an experience. An Adaran avoids cooking and eating when he is angry or grieving, lest his emotions taint the meal. Food is usually baked in or roasted on a clay oven built in the house, though broiling over an open fire is a common alternative. Adarans avoid using utensils. They use their hands, sometimes protected by leaves, to pick up food, intending to involve all five senses in eating. Adarans like spice. The fragrant herbs used in cooking provide taste, and many also aid digestion and fortify the body. Foreigners can find Adaran food too spicy, and Adarans often find foreign food bland.

A wide variety of comestibles can be found on the Adaran table, from broad, woody cavern fungi to the meat of mountain sheep, from fleshy fruits to the milk of oxen and goats — along with yogurt and cheeses from this milk. Some Adarans refrain from eating meat, showing their respect for the lives of all creatures. Monasteries are often more limited in fare, due to the ruggedness of the land around them. Still, the ascetics appreciate food as a manifestation of life.

Adarans wear loose and comfortable clothes including simple sandals when it's warm. In the cold, they layer in cloth and fur. As with all their crafts, they take the time to decorate their clothes — leather and cloth are often richly colored, and patterns of elaborate lines are woven or painted as highlights. Bright colors in individualized patterns often make it possible to tell who's coming down the ridge before that person's face can be recognized.

Skin is a place for adornment as well. Intricate, temporary body art made with herbs provides a way to focus the mind while allowing one to share the results. Herbal paints or powders are also applied to indicate a spiritual or emotional condition or event, such as yellow for happiness or ash-gray for grief.

The Adarans' love of craft manifests in a variety of jewelry. From glass beadwork to tiny silver plates strung together as a head covering, Adar ans spare no effort in producing beautiful objects to wear. They enjoy bracelets, armbands, and torcs. Rings are also favored; Adarans wear just as many rings in their ears and noses, and on their toes, as on their fingers.

### Five Things Every Adaran Knows

1. **The legend of Taratai.** Taratai was the mysterious spirit that led other spirits into Adar to create the kalashtar, and teach the Path of Light. She is a holy mother, a guide, and a warrior. Everyone knows of her sacrifice, and many people in Adar set aside five days of winter to mourn her passing. This "holiday" is called the Void of Taratai.
2. **The dragons created Adar**. Adar is an unnatural amalgam of mountains and storms. The dragons and couatls created the place to make it impossible to get to an evil that sleeps beneath the land. Draconic magic still calls to the unique and the wild to come to Adar and protect it. The Storm Guardians who rule mysterious Korrandar are proof.
3. **Some martial arts.** Many people in Adar know a few dance steps from the path of shadows or a formalized routine from a nearby monastery. Most practice these forms as morning exercise and meditation, and many of them actually know how to fight.
4. **Actions mean more than words.** Whether it's meditation on the Path of Light, stalking and killing a mountain lion that's been eating livestock, or just planting your barley on time, doing something is better than talking or vacillation. In fact, one of the precepts of the Path of Light is that the worst action to take is no action at all.
5. **Death is not the end.** Adherents of the Path of Light believe that nothing in the world or on any plane is eternal. Dolurrh is a place where the ego dies, but the spirit is immortal, and it returns to the Material Plane again and again. The goal of living is eventually to master the Path of Light, thereby transcending fear and false desires. Those who accomplish this become one with il-Yannah.

### What Do You Know?

**Intelligence (History)**
* DC 12: Adar is a place full of strange magic. The greatest custodians of lore in the mountains are known as the Keepers of the Word.
* DC 15: The leader of the Keepers of the Word is called the Speaker of the Word, and this person holds great sway in Adar. But Adar has many other magical traditions.
* DC 18: Adarans believe dragons created their land, and the great mountains there harbor dragons and dragon ruins. The greatest among these are the legendary Storm Guardians who guard the mountain Korrandar.

**Intelligence (Nature)**
* DC 10: Kalashtar come from the insular nation of Adar, which is in southern Sarlona.
* DC 12: Adar is a mountainous region troubled by terrible storms. It has been under siege by Riedra for centuries.
* DC 15: Climate in Adar varies by altitude—valleys can be tropical and extremely fertile while peaks are blasted by glacial winds. Adar's storms aren't altogether natural. Its mightiest mountains, the highest of which is called Korrandar, are blanketed in constant storm clouds.
* DC 18: Adarans are a mixed bunch. Some of them are mountainfolk, while others are monks, magicians, and exiles. Many of these strange folk came to Adar during Sarlona's war- torn past. Most of them live in one of Adar' s eight major settlements all of which are monasti c fortresses carved into the mountains.

**Intelligence (Arcana)**
* DC 15: Some great magic prevents all dimensional travel into and within Adar.
* DC 18: This "magic" is actually a psionic shroud that envelops the country and originates from the temple-fortresses of Adar.
* DC 20: Adar has many manifest zones connected to Lamannia, explaining its supernaturally wild territories. It also has some manifest zones to Kythri. The interaction of these forces might explain some of the storms that rage in the land.

### Development

* Sometime during the Second Sundering, Adarans started feeding (at least certain) criminals to the blue dragons that are prevalent in the area.
* During the summer of the Quiet Year, Adar established Olympics-like games for competitive art. The first one took place the following summer, and every summer since, opening it up to the rest of Sarlona.
* The Wanderers of Twilight still pop up occasionally, so security has increased across the region, especially during the Art-lympics.
