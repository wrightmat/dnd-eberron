Adar is the mountainous region in southeast of Sarlona. It is inhabited mostly by humans (including the kalashtar), though there is a prominent contingent of blue dragons on the uppermost peaks.

To its inhabitants, Adar is mostly known as a refuge from the dictatorship of Riedra, and many of its residents can trace their lineage to refugees and dissidents of the Riedran state. To this day, Riedra considers Adar a danger to its enforced stability, and regularly sends troops to attack the borders of the region.

The region of Adar covers the southeastern tip of Sarlona. The region is defined by tall mountains, cliffs, and plateaus, with the majority of the land being over 12,000 feet in elevation. This includes the mountain of Korrandar, one of the tallest mountains in all of Eberron.

About 20% of the region is arable land, mainly in the valleys between the mountains. The region has a number of manifest zones to Lamannia and Kythri, the largest being Ahdryatmin in the center of Adar.

### Locations

#### Monasteries
Eight monasteries act as fortresses and form a defensive ring around Adar. With the exception of Kasshta Keep, the true locations of these monasteries are kept hidden from outsiders.

* **Dvaarnava**. Located on the southernmost tip of Adar, but hidden from outsiders. While most of Adar's coastline is sheer cliffs, ships can dock at Dvaarnava by traveling past a maze of stone spires into a natural cavern in the cliffs. Most of the population of Dvaarnava live in grottoes farther up the cliffs to be safe from the stormy waters.
* **Ghoza**. Like the other monasteries in Adar, Ghoza's true location is hidden. However it is known to be located on the eastern part of Adar along the Jathara Sound, just south of a wide point in the sound known as Kasshta's Belly. Ghoza is built high in the cliffs near the sound, however it also controls underground caverns that can reach Kasshta's Belly through underwater grottos.
* **Haztaratain**. Carved into a mountainside on the eastern side of Adar close to the coast (within 50 miles of Corvagura), its exact location is hidden from outsiders. It is famous for being the birthplace of the kalashtar, and is a major pilgrimage site for followers of the Path of Light. The Haztaratain monks train at the monastery and often re-gather there on the spring equinox.
* **Kasshta Keep**. Lies on the border of Adar and Syrkarn, carved into a mountain thousands of feet above the waters of the Kasshta River. The only ways to access the Keep are by eastern trails that lead to the Keep's gate, or by magical winches that can lift boats up from the river to an artificial mountain lake. The Keep is often enshrouded by storms and strange mists. The Keep is the original stronghold of the Keepers of the Word. Elders from that organization's Council of the Wise oversee the day to day operations of the Keep. The keep is also the dwelling place of Speaker of the Word, Adar's spiritual leader.
	* The **Council Chambers** in the highest parts of Kasshta Keep are where the most respected elders live and work. It is also the meeting place of the Council of the Wise.
* **Malshashar**. Its true location is a closely guarded secret, especially as it is one of the fortresses guarding Adar's border, but it is located in northern Adar deep in the eastern parts of the Ahnadiv Mountains. The area around the monastery are prone to storms and landslides. The core sections of the monastery are underground beneath a single mountain peak, but a few sections sprawl out under neighboring mountains. Due to the secrecy and the harsh environment, even the food is grown underground.
* **Ruukosi**. The monastery is built on the western side of Adar, into the cliffs on either side of the mouth of the Ruukosi River, where it enters the Jathara Sound. The two halves of the monastery are connected by a natural arch over the river, which has been hollowed out into a lookout post, that can see as far as Syrkarn on a good day.
* **Shalquar**. This monastery lies in northern Adar among the Ahnadiv Mountains, only 22 miles from the village of Hillcorn in Pyrine. Its exact location is kept secret, but its general location is known even to outsiders. The monastery itself is built into two mountains, and guards a narrow pass between them, the only accessible route into Adar in the local area. This monastery was destroyed in 1051 YK by a topaz dragon attack which Aither Lightwood witnessed.
* **Tashalatora**. Its true location is a closely guarded secret, but it is located somewhere in northeastern Adar overlooking Vulpana Falls. The monastery guards one of the only accessible passages into Adar from Corvagura for hundreds of miles.

#### Other Settlements

* **Xephanan**. Capital city of the xephs, located a little south of the central part of Adar. The city lies in a forested canyon valley known as the Xaryai Coulee, named for the Xaryai River that flows through it. The city is lit by luminescent crystals that naturally occur in the rock of the canyon. The xephs see some trade with the closest monastery of Ruukosi, while other xeph merchants run ships out of the port of Dvaarnava.
* **Zi'til'natek**. A dromite hive, located deep underground beneath the site of Malshashar monastery in Adar. Psionic portals connect the monastery with the hive. Zi'til'natek is an ancient city thought to be the origins of dromite civilization in Sarlona. In 703 AT (-99 YK), the kalashtar of Adar convinced the dromites of Zi'til'natek to ally with them against the Inspired of Riedra. The dromites allowed the kalashtar to place a shroud resonator in a cavern near their city after the destruction of the first Malshashar monastery. The dromites continue to maintain this alliance to the present day, trading with Adar through the psionic portals that connect the hive with the monastery. When the Summit Road was established, Zi'til'natek was the initial route used by guides to get out of Adar and to get Riedran refugees into Adar. The Summit Road continues to have cells operating in the hive today.

### Religion and Culture

Traditional Adaran prayers call on Braahyn (Balinor), the god of the wilds and the moving earth, and his spouse Aarakti (Arawai), the goddess of abundance and storms. Many people also respect the spirits of nature and those of their ancestors. Some adherents to the old Path of Light may still remain in Adar.

Adaran people live modestly. Mountainfolk and monks alike see craft as a leisure activity, and the precepts of the Path of Light had reinforced this custom for over a millennium. Adaran crafts are usually functional, and they are always products of care.

### Art and Architecture

Adaran art is more craft than fine art. From carved knife grips to chanted meditation verses, art in Adar often serves a dual purpose. It's also very personal. People in Adar take time to do their tasks. They make beautiful and intricate jewelry and armor, personalized carvings to hang over a house door (which aids in knowing the residents), and even multi-colored crystal windows for their temples. Beauty is always coupled with functionality. A golden roof on a temple not only shows reverence, but it also never tarnishes. A mural not only recalls the past or reveres an ancient master of the Path of Light, but it also beautifies and seals the stone.

A popular art form in Adar is "earth painting." Such works, made of colored earth, are often group efforts and are usually stylized images of intertwining lines of color. The paintings are created in a ritualized and meditative way. Intended to be impermanent, such paintings are at once the product of contemplation and creation.

While storm winds howl, the warm hearth provides a place to gather and create. It's also where stories are told and dances performed. Adaran tales tend toward morality plays, extolling wisdom and survival. Their folk dances are group affairs involving rings of people switching partners or couples dancing in time with one another.

Buildings in Adar are made out of stone, with wood used for roofs. Built to withstand the wind, precipitation, and trembling earth, houses are usually broad and low with sharply slanted sides. To an Aundairian, Adaran living spaces would seem cramped, but a native of Adar values a house that lasts more than she does a high ceiling. Adarans take care and time to personalize their dwellings — an Adaran might spend years carving designs into the walls of her home. Most houses have a central opening in the roof with another smaller roof built over it, like a small tower. Such openings allow light in and stale air out.

Grander edifices, such as the shrines or temples that form the center of a community, are often domed. Most Adarans take pride in a well-appointed village shrine. All buildings face east when possible, or north, but Adarans never build main entrances facing south. The east invites the light and life. The north invites wealth. South is considered a direction of decay and death.

### Food and Fashion

Food holds a special place in Adaran life. It is a requirement for life, but it is also a mode of expression, a blessing from the spirit world, and an experience. An Adaran avoids cooking and eating when he is angry or grieving, lest his emotions taint the meal. Food is usually baked in or roasted on a clay oven built in the house, though broiling over an open fire is a common alternative. Adarans avoid using utensils. They use their hands, sometimes protected by leaves, to pick up food, intending to involve all five senses in eating. Adarans like spice. The fragrant herbs used in cooking provide taste, and many also aid digestion and fortify the body. Foreigners can find Adaran food too spicy, and Adarans often find foreign food bland.

A wide variety of comestibles can be found on the Adaran table, from broad, woody cavern fungi to the meat of mountain sheep, from fleshy fruits to the milk of oxen and goats — along with yogurt and cheeses from this milk. Some Adarans refrain from eating meat, showing their respect for the lives of all creatures. Monasteries are often more limited in fare, due to the ruggedness of the land around them. Still, the ascetics appreciate food as a manifestation of life.

Adarans wear loose and comfortable clothes including simple sandals when it's warm. In the cold, they layer in cloth and fur. As with all their crafts, they take the time to decorate their clothes — leather and cloth are often richly colored, and patterns of elaborate lines are woven or painted as highlights. Bright colors in individualized patterns often make it possible to tell who's coming down the ridge before that person's face can be recognized.

Skin is a place for adornment as well. Intricate, temporary body art made with herbs provides a way to focus the mind while allowing one to share the results. Herbal paints or powders are also applied to indicate a spiritual or emotional condition or event, such as yellow for happiness or ash-gray for grief.

The Adarans' love of craft manifests in a variety of jewelry. From glass beadwork to tiny silver plates strung together as a head covering, Adar ans spare no effort in producing beautiful objects to wear. They enjoy bracelets, armbands, and torcs. Rings are also favored; Adarans wear just as many rings in their ears and noses, and on their toes, as on their fingers.

### Five Things Every Adaran Knows

1. **The legend of Taratai.** Taratai was the mysterious spirit that led other spirits into Adar to create the kalashtar, and teach the Path of Light. She is a holy mother, a guide, and a warrior. Everyone knows of her sacrifice, and many people in Adar set aside five days of winter to mourn her passing. This "holiday" is called the Void of Taratai.
2. **The dragons created Adar**. Adar is an unnatural amalgam of mountains and storms. The dragons and couatls created the place to make it impossible to get to an evil that sleeps beneath the land. Draconic magic still calls to the unique and the wild to come to Adar and protect it. The Storm Guardians who rule mysterious Korrandar are proof.
3. **Some martial arts.** Many people in Adar know a few dance steps from the path of shadows or a formalized routine from a nearby monastery. Most practice these forms as morning exercise and meditation, and many of them actually know how to fight.
4. **Actions mean more than words.** Whether it's meditation on the Path of Light, stalking and killing a mountain lion that's been eating livestock, or just planting your barley on time, doing something is better than talking or vacillation. In fact, one of the precepts of the Path of Light is that the worst action to take is no action at all.
5. **Death is not the end.** Adherents of the Path of Light believe that nothing in the world or on any plane is eternal. Dolurrh is a place where the ego dies, but the spirit is immortal, and it returns to the Material Plane again and again. The goal of living is eventually to master the Path of Light, thereby transcending fear and false desires. Those who accomplish this become one with il-Yannah.

### What Do You Know?

**Intelligence (History)**
* DC 12: Adar is a place full of strange magic. The greatest custodians of lore in the mountains are known as the Keepers of the Word.
* DC 15: The leader of the Keepers of the Word is called the Speaker of the Word, and this person holds great sway in Adar. But Adar has many other magical traditions.
* DC 18: Adarans believe dragons created their land, and the great mountains there harbor dragons and dragon ruins. The greatest among these are the legendary Storm Guardians who guard the mountain Korrandar.

**Intelligence (Nature)**
* DC 10: Kalashtar come from the insular nation of Adar, which is in southern Sarlona.
* DC 12: Adar is a mountainous region troubled by terrible storms. It has been under siege by Riedra for centuries.
* DC 15: Climate in Adar varies by altitude—valleys can be tropical and extremely fertile while peaks are blasted by glacial winds. Adar's storms aren't altogether natural. Its mightiest mountains, the highest of which is called Korrandar, are blanketed in constant storm clouds.
* DC 18: Adarans are a mixed bunch. Some of them are mountainfolk, while others are monks, magicians, and exiles. Many of these strange folk came to Adar during Sarlona's war- torn past. Most of them live in one of Adar' s eight major settlements all of which are monasti c fortresses carved into the mountains.

**Intelligence (Arcana)**
* DC 15: Some great magic prevents all dimensional travel into and within Adar.
* DC 18: This "magic" is actually a psionic shroud that envelops the country and originates from the temple-fortresses of Adar.
* DC 20: Adar has many manifest zones connected to Lamannia, explaining its supernaturally wild territories. It also has some manifest zones to Kythri. The interaction of these forces might explain some of the storms that rage in the land.

### Development

* Sometime during the Second Sundering, Adarans started feeding (at least certain) criminals to the blue dragons that are prevalent in the area.
* The Wanderers of Twilight still pop up occasionally, so security has increased across the region, especially during the Art-lympics.

### Unity Games

During the summer of the Quiet Year, Adar established Olympics-like games ("Unity Games") for competitive art. The first one took place the following summer, and every summer since, opening it up to the rest of Sarlona. Eventually the number of events expanded, but kept specific to the monastic style of Adar. The events below are presented in the order that they've been added to the games, with the last event listed being brand new this year (and still kept secret).

The Opening Ceremony of the Unity Games always takes place on the first day before any events, and consists of a group of Adaran blue dragons flying overhead like the Blue Angels jets.

##### 1. The Canvas of Souls
- In this competitive art event (the first event of the games in honor of it being the only event in the first games), participants create artwork that reflects their personal interpretation of life's journey and spiritual growth. Each artist is provided with materials that represent the four elements — earth, air, fire, and water — as symbols of the life force that binds the universe. The artists must use these elements in their creations, which can range from paintings and sculptures to mixed media installations.
- A Charisma (Performance) check, with any appropriate tool proficiencies added, and extra bonuses for creativity, determines how many points they get (15+ is 1 point, and 20+ is 2 points).

##### 2. The Stormstride
- Participants must carry a "lightning orb" that intermittently discharges small bolts of electricity. This 4x400 meter (1300 feet) event is run in teams of four, with each member running an equal leg.
- Participants run their normal speed (no dashing), multiplied by ten to determine how far they travel in one minute. They then make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10) every minute to maintain their grip on the charged orb. On a failed save, they drop the orb and must spend extra time (6 seconds) to pick it up again.
- Participants must pass the orb to a team member in a relay format, requiring a successful Sleight of Hand check (DC 10 plus however many times they've been shocked) to ensure a smooth handoff. On a failed save, they drop the orb and the new runner must spend extra time (6 seconds) to pick it up again.
- Two teams compete, with the winners getting 2 points, and the runners-up getting 1 point.

##### 3. The Wind Sprint
- Competitors race across a series of platforms suspended high in the air, utilizing their agility and balance to navigate swiftly and safely to the finish line.
- Participants make a series of Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to navigate from one platform to another. The DC for these checks starts at 10 and increases by 2 for each platform, maxing out at 20 (so six platforms).
- A failed check results in the participant slipping, which requires a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to catch themselves on the edge of the platform. Failing this saving throw means they fall 60 feet (taking `dice:6d6` bludgeoning damage) and gain no points.
- The number of points is based on the number of successful checks (2+ is 1 point, and 4+ is 2 points).

##### 4. The Elemental Relay
- Teams use their abilities to manipulate elements (air, earth, fire, water) to complete a relay race that includes tasks like extinguishing flames, creating breezes, shaping earth, and channeling water. This 4x100 meter (300 feet) event is run in teams of four, with each member running an equal leg.
- **Air Leg**
	- Participants must navigate through a series of wind tunnels that push and pull in various directions. Participants make Dexterity saving throws (DC 13) to maintain balance and progress through the tunnels without being knocked off course. On a failed save, their speed is cut in half for that round as they fight against the wind gusts.
	- Using spells or abilities to control air (like gust of wind) can lower the DC by 2, reflecting effective manipulation of air.
- **Earth Leg**
	- Runners navigate a maze with walls that periodically shift positions, requiring quick adaptation and problem-solving.
	- Runners make an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15) to predict wall movements and choose the correct path. Failure results in an earthen wall rising in front of them to a height of `dice:1d6*5`feet.
	- Physical barriers can be climbed normally, or runners may attempt a Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15) to climb. While climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot, unless a creature has a climbing speed.
- **Fire Leg**
	- Participants run through a course dotted with rings of fire, needing to pass through them without getting burned.
	- Acrobatics checks (DC 14) are required to agilely maneuver through the rings.
	- Participants can use spells or abilities to protect against or extinguish fire to reduce the DC by 2 or avoid damage.
- **Water Leg**
	- The final leg involves crossing a fast-flowing stream using stepping stones that are slippery and unstable.
	- A series of two Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks (DC 16) is required to hop between stones without slipping into the water. Failure results in the player losing their footing, taking 6 seconds to recover.
	- Participants may use water manipulation spells or abilities to calm the stream temporarily, making checks easier (DC reduction by 3 for one turn).
- For each leg, participants must pass the orb to a team member in a relay format, requiring a successful Sleight of Hand check (DC 10) to ensure a smooth handoff. On a failed save, they drop the orb and the new runner must spend extra time (6 seconds) to pick it up again.
- Two teams compete, with the winners getting 2 points, and the runners-up getting 1 point.

##### 5. The Staff Duel
- Participants face off in a martial arts contest using staffs, emphasizing defensive maneuvers and the ability to disarm or outmaneuver their opponent without causing injury.
- This is basically a combat encounter, but each side can only use a bo staff. Use the Githzerai Monk as the base for the monk competitor - 38 (7d8 + 7) HP, AC 14, two attacks with Multiattack.
- Staff Damage: 1d6 (1d8) Bludgeoning (Versatile).
- The first to best their challenger, by reducing them to 0 hit points, wins a point. Either party then has the option to ask for one additional match.

##### 6. The Psychic Archery
- Archers must hit targets that are only visible through psychic perception, challenging their mental focus and archery skills simultaneously.
- Participants must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 15) to visualize each target. If they fail, the target remains invisible to them, increasing the difficulty of hitting it.
- Once a target is perceived, contestants must make an attack roll to hit the target with a bow and arrow. Normal archery mechanics apply, but hitting an invisible target (if the Perception check was failed) imposes disadvantage on the attack roll. For visible targets (successful Perception check), contestants make a regular ranged attack roll against a target AC of 12.
- Participants can use abilities or magical enhancements to improve their accuracy or gain bonuses on their attack rolls or Perception check to see the target.
- Each participant has four arrows in their quiver, and gets one point for each successful target hit.

##### 7. The Chanting Choir
- Teams compete in a chanting competition where they must harmonize not only their voices but their psychic energies, creating a mesmerizing auditory and mental experience.
- Participants make a Charisma (Performance) check (DC 12) to effectively sing and harmonize with their group. Teams with members who have musical backgrounds (+2) or proficiencies receive that benefit on this check.
- Teams must also synchronize their psychic energies to enhance the emotional impact of their chant. Following the vocal performance, the team makes a group Wisdom (Insight) check with a DC of 15 to align their psychic energies, adding depth and power to their performance. Teams that include characters with psychic abilities or spells that aid in emotional or mental connection can lower this DC by 2.
- The team with the higher combined Performance and Insight checks wins a point. If that team is more than 5 better than the other team, they gain 2 points instead.

##### 8. The Ascetic's Climb
- Competitors climb a steep path while carrying weights that symbolize spiritual burdens, shedding them as they answer riddles based on Adaran philosophy to lighten their load and reach the summit.
- Participants begin the climb carrying a weighted pack that symbolizes their spiritual burdens. The heavy pack adds a penalty of -5 (disadvantage) to all their physical checks (Athletics, Acrobatics).
- The path features physical obstacles such as steep inclines, slippery rocks, and narrow ledges. Participants must make a series of Strength (Athletics) checks to overcome physical obstacles. Each obstacle has a set DC (ranging from 12 to 18), depending on its difficulty. Successful navigation of an obstacle allows participants to shed a portion of their burden, reducing the penalty by 1 for each success.
- Interspersed along the climb are riddle stations where participants must solve philosophical quandaries to lighten their spiritual load. At each question station, participants make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 15) to solve the quandaries, reducing their penalty by 1 for each success.
- The last segment of the climb is the steepest and requires participants to draw upon their remaining strength and insight. This segment requires a final Strength (Athletics) check (DC 16). Participants who have successfully lightened their load significantly (reduced their penalty to -1 or less) receive advantage on this check.
- Upon reaching the summit, participants undergo a moment of spiritual revelation, reflecting on their journey. A final Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 14) at the summit determines the depth of their spiritual insight gained from the climb. Success results in a temporary boon, such as advantage on Wisdom checks or saving throws for the next 24 hours, symbolizing their enlightened state.
- The climb is performed by three individuals at the same time. Whoever reaches the summit first gains 2 points, the runner-up gains 1 point, and the loser gains no points.

##### 9. The Aerial Race
- Participants use wind gliders to navigate a course set high in the sky, requiring skillful control of air currents and precise maneuvering.
- Contestants make a single Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC 15) to steer their glider through the course. Participants can attempt to use the wind to their advantage. A successful Wisdom (Nature) check (DC 12) allows them to catch a favorable gust, granting a +2 bonus to their Acrobatics check.
- Optionally, participants can glide through aerial rings placed at strategic points along the course to gain extra points. For each ring successfully navigated, up to three, participants perform a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC 13). Success results in bonus points added to their final score. Missing a ring adds a time penalty (6 seconds), decreasing their chances of winning the race.
- The final test is to execute a perfect landing at the end of the course, which is marked by a narrow landing strip. A final Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC 14) is required for a smooth landing. The first to finish the race gets a point, and an additional point can be awarded by the judges if the final check is successful by 5 or more.

##### 10. The Healing Hands
- A high-stakes event where healers must correctly diagnose and treat ailments using a combination of herbal medicine, psychic healing, and traditional remedies.
- First, diagnose a set of symptoms presented on a volunteer or a magical simulation. Participants make a Wisdom (Medicine) check to identify the ailment. Each ailment has a set difficulty class, generally ranging from DC 12 for common conditions to DC 18 for rare or complex diseases. Successful diagnosis within the first attempt grants maximum points, while additional attempts reduce the score.
- Once the diagnosis is confirmed, participants must choose an appropriate treatment from a range of options. For correct treatment application, a second Wisdom (Medicine) check is required, with the DC dependent on the complexity of the treatment (similar to the diagnostic DC). Participants may use spells, herbal remedies, or surgical techniques, each with specific benefits and risks. For example, using a healing spell like *[[cure wounds]]* could provide a bonus to the treatment check.
- Participants face a sudden, critical situation where they must stabilize a condition that rapidly deteriorates. This requires a quick Constitution saving throw (DC 15) to maintain composure, followed by an urgent Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC 16) to stabilize the condition.
- Last, evaluate and address the patient's overall well-being, not just the immediate symptoms, to promote complete recovery. Participants make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to effectively communicate with the patient, ensuring their comfort and cooperation, which is crucial for holistic care (DC 14).
- For every successful check (diagnosis, treatment, stabilization, bedside manner), the competitor gains one point.

##### Final. The Luminous Journey
- "The Luminous Journey" is designed to simulate the spiritual path of a soul as taught by the Path of Light, focusing on the themes of life's experiences, trials, and ultimate return to the universal life force. This event combines physical challenges, puzzle-solving, and role-playing elements to test participants' resilience, wisdom, and alignment with spiritual harmony.
- **Station of Awakening** (Birth and Innocence)
	- Participants find themselves in a maze filled with mirrors and soft fog, symbolizing the confusion and innocence of early life.
	- Participants make Wisdom (Perception) checks (DC 12) to find their way out. Failure by 5 or more means they become "lost" and need assistance from event guides (representing parental guidance) to exit, losing a minute of time in the process.
- **Trials of Strength** (Youth and Challenges)
	- A series of physical obstacles including climbing walls (to represent overcoming personal barriers) and balancing beams (to symbolize life balance).
	- Participants must succeed on two Athletics checks (climbing DC 15, balancing DC 13). Each failure results in a "setback story" they must role-play, reflecting on a personal challenge or failure.
- **Pool of Visions** (Midlife and Reflection)
	- Participants meditate beside a tranquil pool, receiving visions of potential futures.
	- Participants engage in a Meditation Challenge where they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to gain a clear vision; a successful check grants them a "Visionary Bonus" (advantage on the next skill check). Failure results in confusing, mixed messages (see Confusing Visions table below).
- **Path of the Elders** (Wisdom and Age)
	- Navigate a path where they encounter NPCs who present ethical dilemmas or philosophical questions.
	- Participants must make Charisma (Persuasion) or Intelligence (Religion) checks (DC 14) to appropriately address the dilemmas. Success grants one point toward their final score. Each participant must answer at least one question, but may be asked and answer as many as they choose, with each taking one minute and requiring a new check.
		- Does the end always justify the means, even at the cost of innocence?
		- Is it better to seek truth, even if it brings pain, or to live in ignorance for peace?
		- Can true order be maintained without suppressing some form of chaos?
		- Is mercy a weakness or a strength in the face of opposition?
		- Should personal freedom ever be sacrificed for the greater good?
		- Is it more virtuous to act with compassion or to uphold justice?
		- Can loyalty to family or nation justify morally questionable actions?
		- Should one prioritize the wellbeing of the present or invest in an uncertain future?
		- Can a person’s inherent nature ever truly change, or is destiny fixed?
		- Is it ethical to preserve life at all costs, even if it leads to suffering?
- **The Final Release** (Death and Reunion)
	- Participants perform a symbolic ritual where they release a crafted biodegradable item into a flowing river, representing their soul’s return to the universal life force.
	- This ritual involves a final DC 16 Intelligence (Performance) check to properly perform the release. Success in this task symbolizes a peaceful transition and grants a point toward their final score.
- Points are awarded based on successful checks, with additional points for creativity in solving puzzles and role-playing interactions. The winner is the participant who best demonstrates balance, wisdom, and spiritual insight throughout the journey. Judges hold up cards with scores at the end of the series of challenges.

| 1   | **Shifting Skies**: The participant sees the sky torn between night and day, with stars that briefly turn into dragons, then vanish. This vision suggests cosmic forces at play but leaves the participant unsure whether these dragons are protectors or destroyers.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2   | **A Dimming Sun**: A radiant sun slowly dims, casting long shadows that take the shape of a large and very old red dragon. The participant hears whispered promises of power but can't tell if these whispers come from the dragons or something more sinister, like Tiamat’s influence.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3   | **The Splintering Tree**: A majestic tree, representing balance and growth, splits down the middle, with one half blooming in gold and the other in green. Inside the freshly split tree is a baby with strange features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4   | **Voices in the Flame**: A bright silver flame flickers before the participant, but the voices within the flame argue in circles, speaking of unity and betrayal. This leaves the participant uncertain whether the dragons' connection to the Church of the Silver Flame is a blessing or a curse.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5   | **A Thousand Eyes**: A vision of an endless field of eyes watching from the darkness, none blinking or moving. The participant feels an overwhelming sense of being watched, but they cannot discern whether the eyes belong to benevolent forces or the manipulations of the dragons and their plans for Tiamat.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6   | **The Shifting Scale**: The participant sees a dragon in the distance, its scales gleaming metallic. As it approaches, the scales shift and change color, flickering between steel-gray and various vibrant hues. Just as the dragon’s eyes meet the participant’s, its form blurs, becoming indistinct, humanoid, and then draconic again. The participant feels an overwhelming sense of familiarity and trust toward the figure but cannot reconcile the shifting forms. |
