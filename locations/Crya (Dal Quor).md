### Locations

#### Gates of Horn and Ivory
Light blue banners bearing the symbol of the plane of Dal Quor hang from each of the gates. The gates themselves are large Roman-style arches, each made of a different material.

#### The Ocean of Dreams
A vast expanse of psychic space surrounds il-Lashtavar, home to millions of mortal dreams. The islands in the Ocean of Dreams range from the complex dreamscapes of sentient creatures, humans and dragons alike, to the simple dream of a dog thatâ€™s imagining chasing a ball. From the outside, these islands appear as glittering bubbles, each with an image of its dreamer within it. Theyâ€™re loosely arranged based on the physical location of the dreamer, so thereâ€™s a stretch of the ocean that contains dreamers near Breland, another for Thrane, and so on â€” including regions for any dreamers currently on other planes.

##### The Riedran Sea
Over centuries, the Inspired have built a network of monoliths in Riedra, psychic anchors called hanbalani altas. These allow them to control everyoneâ€™s dreams over a vast radius. Dreams are typically tailored to the region, including local news and instructions. However, if they choose, the Inspired can broadcast a single dream to all of Sarlona. Within Dal Quor, this manifests as a distinctive region of the Ocean of Dreams â€” an array of hundreds of thousands of islands, dream-bubbles arranged in perfect symmetrical rows, with identical images in each bubble.

##### The Uul Dhakaan
Jhazaal Dhakaan united the dar through an act of epic bardic magic. When the dar dream, they donâ€™t create their own islands in the Ocean. Instead, they are drawn to a vast, ongoing dream â€” the Uul Dhakaan, as discussed in chapter 4. This is a vision of what the Dhakaani Empire could and should be, and it encompasses many cities and fortresses. In addition to the spirits of dreaming dar, this enormous dream is filled with countless figments â€” both background soldiers, artisans, and facsimiles of legendary champions whose memories have been preserved. Most dar arenâ€™t lucid dreamers and they donâ€™t fully remember the time they spend in the Uul Dhakaan, but it reinforces Dhakaani values and traditions. If adventurers want to experience what the Dhakaani Empire was at its height â€” and what it could be again â€”they can find it here. Chotâ€™uul guardians maintain outposts throughout the dream, along with a great monastery in the capital city. The magic woven into the dream ensures that the throne in the imperial palace remains empty â€” for now. But when a new emperor is chosen and has the support of the majority of the dar, theyâ€™ll hold the throne in the Uul Dhakaan as well as in the Material Plane.

##### Quor Toa
Swimming within the Ocean of Dreams is a rogue civilization of Quor-Toa (see *Chronicles of Eberron*). As the Dreaming Dark fears them, adventurers are mostly safe in this area of Crya.

##### Xen'drik
One area of the Ocean is clearly being focused upon by a large group of quori. This is the Xen'drik region of the Ocean, and the quori are actively attacking the dreams of the Giants as part of their invasion effort.

#### Taer Lian Doresh
Thousands of years ago, one of the eladrinâ€™s feyspires, Shae Tirias Tolai, slipped from Thelanis into Xen'drik â€” but when it appeared, the giants were waiting. They pillaged the feyspire, claiming its treasures and taking its people as slaves. The other eladrin lords responded by improving their defensive magic. However, some among them wanted more â€” they sought vengeance.

The lords of Shae Doresh, the Spire of Dreams, swore to make the giants pay. They transformed their settlement into a mighty fortress, crafting arms, armor, and powerful spells of battle. When their feyspire next appeared in Eberron, they challenged the emperor of the giants, but they had woefully underestimated the power of the titan king. With a powerful ritual, he banished the feyspire to the plane of Dal Quor, where it remained trapped until the cycle of that plane spat it back to Thelanis once more.

By the time Shae Doresh next returned to Eberron, the giants had been laid low. However, the fey had been tainted by their long sojourn in Dal Quor, their feyspire transformed into a haven for nightmares â€” now called Taer Lian Doresh, the Fortress of Fading Dreams.

The spire exists in a state of flux, simultaneously on Dal Quor and Eberron (within the Whitepine Forest of the Lhazaar Principalities) â€” though anyone who leaves the spire returns to the plane he or she came from. Due to this, the players could theoretically return to Eberron and come back to Dal Quor, but anyone native to Dal Quor cannot.

#### Il-Lashtavar

The heart of Dal Quor is a city known as il-Lashtavar. This vast dreamscape, orbited by the Ocean of Dreams, is the source and home of the quori. Itâ€™s currently a menagerie of nightmares, a showcase of terrors that haunt the dreams of mortals.

##### Outer Ring

The outer ring is protected by a perimeter wall, separating it from the Ocean of Dreams. The wall is studded by three large towers, each the realm of a separate type of quori:

- The **Red Tower** is the domain of the duâ€™ulora quori, who appear as a collection of wings and eyes suspended in shadows, with three protruding tendrils that end in an eyeball. They reside within their fort and direct the troops in the other two towers. Du'ulora are cold, calculating creatures who thrive on battle and defeating worthy foes. They feed off of the rage they induce in others.
- The **Blue Tower** is the domain of the usvapna, the spies and assassins of the quori. Usvapnas are up to 10 feet tall, possessing a mostly humanoid torso, but with four arms ending in crab-like pincers, and a long snakelike tail. They do not have a head; instead a cloud of darkness rests where the head would normally be.
- The **Black Tower** is the domain of the tsoreva, the enforcers and shock troopers of the quori.

On the edges of il-Lashtavar, corpses dangle from the trees of a haunted orchard. Blood drips from the leaves of a terrifying topiary maze. While the basic form of these nightmares is stable, they feed on the psyches of nearby mortals. Adventurers walking through the orchard see the hanging corpses as the people they most care about, or even as themselves â€” whatever is most disturbing to each intruder. At any given time, there are hundreds or even thousands of quori here, primarily the tsucora quori who roam the streets. Il-Lashtavar is the most dangerous place in Dal Quor â€” only the most powerful and prepared adventurers should enter the city.

##### Inner Ring

Those who press through this outer ring of nightmares find the three great inner fortresses. In the center of the courtyard connecting them are three glowing triangular crystals, each of different color and representing one of the three Ages (see below). The dark blue one in the center represents il-Lashtavar, The Dreaming Dark (with that inscribed in Quori along the length of the crystal). The silvery white one (looking exactly like the symbol for the Path of Light) on the left represents il-Yannah, The Dreaming Light. And a final glittering pink one on the right represents il-Chormeum, The Dreaming Heart.

* The Devourer of Dreams, the kalaraq quori who coordinates the actions of the Dreaming Dark on Eberron, and serves as the right hand of Dream, resides in the **Right Tower**. The quori spirits tied to agents of the Dreaming Dark and the Inspired can return here whenever they choose, reporting to The Devourer and coordinating with other quori. The fortress itself is ever shifting; it might be formed from black twisted roots, or the walls could be blood-soaked spiderwebs. At the very center is a pool of shadows. Itâ€™s here that newborn quori emerge when theyâ€™re reincarnated, and here that the Devourer of Dreams descends into the pool to commune with the Great Darkness (also known as Mother Void).
* The **Archive of Dreams**, also known as the **Left Tower**, is run by the hashalaq quori (including one named Ashana). Here, every dream that has ever been had, across all of the ages, is stored. The Archive is attended by the Archivist, the left hand of Dream. The Archive of Dreams includes a rough "map" of the Ocean of Dreams, where the Archivist and the hashalaq quori know the vague location of different types of dreamers. Although it would be impossible to observe and archive all dreams, the Archivist may track or record certain dreams that it finds important.
* The **Central, or Grand Tower**, is the home of Dream (also known as Quor Tarai by the creatures of Eberron), the Endless who controls the plane. All of Dal Quor is the realm of Dream. Dream himself will never die, but his quori are destroyed and reborn in the Turning of the Age, bringing a new age to Dal Quor. Dream himself is indifferent to this process, and sees it as necessary - it has happened before and will continue to happen - he will remain and only his quori followers (including his left and right hands) will change.

### Universal Properties

Dal Quor is a place where impossible things are possible and the surroundings can change in the blink of an eye. What differentiates it from Kythri and Xoriat is that these changes are drawn from the minds of dreamers, both from the mortal subconscious and the ancient dreams of il-Lashtavar itself.
Even when youâ€™re exploring someone elseâ€™s dreams, your desires and memories can infect the landscape. The Shifting Dreams table provides ideas for how a dream could change.

**Shifting Dreams**

| d8 | Dream Event |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A familiar melody can be heard throughout the area. Ask a player to describe the song. |
| 2 | A word appears on the wall. Is it a clue, or just mysterious? |
| 3 | A familiar NPCâ€”a trusted ally or despised villainâ€”enters. |
| 4 | A creatureâ€™s weapon, armor, or other equipment takes on an irrational new appearanceâ€”perhaps a giant banana. This has no effect on its statistics, and the effect ends in 1 minute. |
| 5 | A creature now appears to be a child or a creature of another race. This has no effect on their abilities, and the effect ends in 1 minute. |
| 6 | A creatureâ€™s beloved petâ€”perhaps from their childhoodâ€” appears in the scene. |
| 7 | Thereâ€™s a dramaticâ€”and possibly surrealâ€”shift in the weather or apparent time of day. |
| 8 | A creature gains a flying speed equal to their regular walking speed. This lasts for 1 minute. |

**Extremely Morphic**. The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the DMâ€™s discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creatureâ€™s dream that theyâ€™re currently experiencing.

**Extended Illusion**. When a creature casts an illusion spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

**Flowing Time**. For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane. While sleeping for 8 hours, a creature could spend 3 days in Dal Quor.
