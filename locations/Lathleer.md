### Characters

* **Master Edmond Thatcher** (male human veteran). A retired artisan and former member of the stonemason’s guild. He’s an older human with thick arms, always covered in a fine layer of dust. He’s known for being blunt and practical but has a certain fondness for skill.
* **Madame Elise Gibbard** (female human noble). A well-dressed middle-aged human who runs a high-end boutique for tailoring noble attire. She knew Alton’s wife and still refers to him formally.
* **Tobin "Toby" Arkwright** (male half-elf child). A street vendor who sells roasted nuts and sweet rolls on the Willow Walk. He’s a young half-elf with a cheerful, chatty nature.

### Locations

* **The Titan’s Hand**. A prominent stonemason’s guild hall and workshop, a grand structure with chiseled reliefs depicting legendary Aundairian figures.
* **The Willow Walk**. A narrow, picturesque street lined with drooping willow trees and wrought-iron street lamps. The cobblestones here are smoother, a sign of noble wealth.
* **Prescott Manor**. A stately but somewhat cold noble residence, still bearing the Prescott family crest on the gates.
