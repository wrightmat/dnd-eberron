The Frostfell is a continent on Eberron, a frozen wasteland to the north that is as as enigmatic as it is cold. To date, there has been only one recorded expedition to the Frostfell from Khorvaire and it was little more than a notch in a belt than a true exploratory mission. That expedition was headed by Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, a halfling and the founder of the Wayfinder Foundation.

The Frostfell is a bleak and frigid land covering the northern pole of Eberron. It is extremely cold, with numerous manifest zones to the plane of Risia, making the cold even more deadly.

There are no nations on the continent of Frostfell, nor are there any known permanent settlements of any of the existing nations of the other continents. The Frostfell remains open territory, though no nation has shown any interest in claiming it. The only modern settlement on the entire continent is the hidden city ofÂ Icerazer

### Locations

* **Dayne Bay**, named after Boroman ir'Dayne, is a large bay near where the Frostfell meets Sarlona.
* **Icehammer Palace**, a rumored floating "skyberg" high above Icewhite Island, which has been around since the Age of Demons.
* **Icewhite Island** sits between the Frostfell and Khorvaire. Nearby also sits Icewhite Island's three "children": Icegaunt Island, Qorrashi Island, and Tlalusk Island. Though they fall between Khorvaire and Frostfell, all four islands are considered part of the Frostfell, owing to their frigid temperatures.
* **The Iceworm** Peaks bisect the continent. These mountains are cloaked by great glaciers.
* **The Wayfinder Tundra**, named after the ir'Dayne expedition, borders the Barren Sea and the Bitter Sea. This expanse of tundra is actually home to fields of lichen during the summer months, though they quickly freeze over during the winter.

### History

Little is known about the early history of the Frostfell. The first major recorded event is when, 12,000 years ago, clans of dwarves emigrated from the winter lands to Khorvaire.

After an especially raucous night at the Glitterdust Nightclub in Sharn, explorer Boroman ir'Dayne proposed an expedition to the Frostfell. ir'Dayne turned out to lead the only successful expedition to the Frostfell. ir'Dayne gained fame for his expedition, and began the Wayfinder Foundation.

Since his initial expedition, Lord ir'Dayne has expressed interest in returning to the Frostfell. Likewise, House Tharashk has also been interested in planning an expedition to the frozen continent.

In 893 YK, another expedition attempted to explore the Frostfell. The expedition, aboard the ice-cutter the North Seeker, was lost, even with being in communication with House Sivis.
