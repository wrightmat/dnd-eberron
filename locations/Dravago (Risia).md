### Universal Properties

Risia is bitterly cold, and unprotected creatures quickly succumb to the deadly temperatures. Here are a few of the consistent properties of the plane.

**Lethal Cold**. A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 1 hour or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature thatâ€™s usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.

**Empowered Ice**. When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals cold damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

**Preservation**. A creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn, entering a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, itâ€™s drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesnâ€™t grow older.

**Stagnation**. When a creature finishes a long rest, it doesnâ€™t regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. However, it does recover Hit Dice normally and can spend them to regain hit points.

**Stillness of Flesh**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creatureâ€™s body, and creatures donâ€™t age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points, and donâ€™t immediately kill it. Dwarves are immune to this propertyâ€™s effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.
