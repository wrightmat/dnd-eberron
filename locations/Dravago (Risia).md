### Locations

#### The Boundless Blizzard
>Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. You find yourselves on an icy plateau, with the vicious storm limiting your visibility. This area appears to be permanently caught between night and day, bathed in twilight, but you can barely ascertain the outline of something in the distance.


#### The Frozen Sea
> You step out onto an ocean that appears was frozen in a single instant. There’s no sign of any shore, just waves caught mid-crest alongside the frozen funnels of maelstroms. And scattered across the realm, there are countless ships — vessels pulled from the oceans of Eberron in moments when the moons were right and Risia was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked, caught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are in perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice. It’s always night on the Frozen Sea; the moon Dravago is fixed in the cloudless sky, shedding dim light on the water.

Ships from throughout history can be found here, Lyrandar elemental galleons alongside massive ships built by the ancient giants of Xen’drik.

#### Freehearth
>Rising before you is a several-hundred-foot-tall circular tower, seemingly made of ice, poking out of a mountain. Weaving up the mountain’s southern slope are enormous stairs hewn from the ice. These steps, which extend from the base of the mountain to the base of the tower where a large door can be seen, were clearly made for giants.


#### Frostmantle
> This seemingly endless range of mountains, formed of solid ice, is surrounded by a sea of dense mist. Perhaps land lies somewhere far below, or the mountains might continue down indefinitely into the darkness.

Frostmantle is the primary home of the frost giants of Il’Ara, who have carved citadels from the ice of the mountains. The three largest fortresses are called Freehearth, Remorse, and Winter. Remorse holds many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom, while Winter is the abode of Il’Ara herself. Numerous smaller keeps are spread across the peaks, the abodes of individual giants.
Clouds hide the sky above Frostmantle, but the light is steady and unchanging; night never falls here. Travelers must deal with the effects of high altitude as well as the Lethal Cold.

#### Remorse
This tower holds the bodies of many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom. Each floor houses six sarcophagi that are made of the same magical ice used to make the towers.

#### Winter
>Rising before you is a several-hundred-foot-tall mountain of glacial ice, its peak carved to resemble a gigantic snowflake. Weaving up the mountain’s southern slope are enormous stairs hewn from the ice, clearly made for giants.

#### Frozen Grove
> A grove of frost-covered trees fills this fifty-foot-high cavern, the floor of which is a mixture of earth and ice. By some magic or miracle, the trees are alive, their canopies thick with frosty leaves, their branches bearing purple pears that hang like ornaments.

This grove of pear trees was enchanted by Il’Ara long ago to endure high altitude and harsh weather. That magic has enabled the trees to thrive even on this icy moon.

**Purple Pears**. Each tree has 3d6 ripe pears hanging from its branches, most of them within reach. Any creature that eats more than half of a purple pear gains the benefit of a special charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in the DMG). Determine the charm randomly by rolling a d20 and consulting the Purple Pear Charms table. This charm must vanish from a creature before it can gain any more charms by eating purple pears. A creature that eats three or more purple pears within 1 hour is poisoned for 24 hours thereafter and suffers painful cramps until the condition ends.

### Universal Properties

Risia is bitterly cold, and unprotected creatures quickly succumb to the deadly temperatures. Here are a few of the consistent properties of the plane.

**Lethal Cold**. A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 1 hour or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that’s usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.

**Empowered Ice**. When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals cold damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

**Preservation**. A creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn, entering a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, it’s drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn’t grow older.

**Stagnation**. When a creature finishes a long rest, it doesn’t regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. However, it does recover Hit Dice normally and can spend them to regain hit points.

**Stillness of Flesh**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature’s body, and creatures don’t age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points, and don’t immediately kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property’s effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.
