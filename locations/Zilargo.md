>“Five words can defeat a thousand swords” — Zil proverb

Zilargo is a Gnomish nation in the South of Khorvaire. It is best known for its national newspaper, elemental binding, bards, Korranberg Library and diplomatic expertise. The kingdom of Galifar invaded Zilargo around 5YK and Zilargo swiftly surrendered. During the negotiations Zilargo managed to become an independent province within the kingdom. Under the Treaty of Thronehold Zilargo managed to become an independent nation state once again, though it still retains close diplomatic ties to Breland.
