Regalport is a large town that lies on the eastern shore of Greentarn island in the Lhazaar Principalities. It is the seat of power for the Seadragons and the capital of High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn's principality and also the largest and most prosperous town of the Principalities.

The town is the port of call for the Seadragons and their fleet of twenty vessels. Its ruler, Ryger, who claims to have a royal Galifaran bloodline, wishes to unite the various principalities, but is currently seen as a leader among equals, even though he represented the region at Thronehold.

House Thuranni have their headquarters in Regalport after having accepted an invitation by then High Prince Horget Black twenty-five years ago. House Thuranni's leader, Baron Elar d'Thuranni, lives in these headquarters.

### Characters

* **High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn** (LN male human ranger). The leader of the Lhazaar Principalities, and Commander of the Seadragon Fleet (from his ship the Dragoneye), whose home is in Regalport. High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn is very clever, using his sword and words to get what he needs and wants. His reputation encourages local merchants to ally themselves with him in order to protect their vessels. No other band of pirates dares to raid Regalport. Ryger has allied himself with House Thuranni and gave them some land in Regalport soon after he became a prince. Many rumors spin about this alliance being a leverage against the Gray Tide principality. He wants the Principalities to join together as a true unified nation with a clear hierarchy, but that has not yet been achieved.
* **Baron Elar d'Thuranni** (LN male elf). Patriarch of House Thuranni. Baron Elar always has at his side two greater shadows named Wrem and Wrek. These creatures are as dark as night, and as insubstantial as smoke. They serve as the Baron's bodyguards, as well as his agents during the few important times when the Baron himself goes on an assassination. The Baron has a residence above the Grand Thuranni Theater, and runs the back of house.
* **Viceroy Ureilya d'Thuranni** (female elf). Secret leader of the Dragon's Path, a group dedicated to understanding theÂ draconic prophecy. The Viceroy runs the front of house at the Grand Thuranni Theater when in town, but she travels the continent and lives elsewhere (and refuses to divulge where).
* **Terrance Akrifolous** (male changeling). High Prince Ryger's right hand man, and Commander of the second gem of the Seadragon Fleet, the Dragon's Hoard.
* **Jorik Saltweave** (male human). A charismatic and rugged human in his late forties, with a keen eye for both fashion and function, especially when it comes to outfitting the various pirates and sailors who frequent the Pirate Exchange of Regalport. With tanned skin weathered by the sea and hair the color of sun-bleached sand, Jorik embodies the spirit of the sea. His shop, "The Salty Spindle," is an eclectic mix of high-seas fashion and practical maritime gear, catering to a clientele that values both style and durability in their garments.
