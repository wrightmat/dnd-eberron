Khalesh is a land of temperate plains and desert — green grassland fading into sunbaked plains and mesas. While it’s more hospitable than neighboring Borunan, at a glance it’s rather barren — endless and empty. And yet, if you wander these plains, you may find yourself enveloped by a sense of well-being, a deep-rooted optimism, and the knowledge that all will be well… with an underlying conviction that you’ll fight to keep it that way.

The people of ancient Khalesh were constantly clashing with their neighbors. They fought supernatural threats, sometimes battling aberrations from Khyber, destroying undead, or smashing extraplanar threats. But they were unduly proud of their virtue, and the pervasive influence of Shavarath drove them to fight — to look for flaws in the people around them. They fought the tyrants of Nulakesh, clashed with the reavers of Rhiavhaar and the bandits of Sunyagir, and battled the beasts of Borunan. In periods when they were at peace with Nulakesh, they would join forces to attack Ohr Kaluun… which, to be fair, certainly deserved it.

Khalesh was always deeply unpopular with its neighbors, so it wasn’t hard for the quori to harness that resentment. But they also had another card to play. Quori agents revealed that the noble families of Khalesh had long concealed a bizarre secret: that over untold generations of devotion to the serpent cult, Khaleshite champions had gradually become something inhuman. The Khaleshite leadership was riddled with shulassakar, a feathered form of yuan-ti tied to the couatl. While the shulassakar were devoted servants of the light, the quori were able to twist this through dreams and agents, convincing the common people that the shulassakar were monstrous alien invaders — that they were the fiends, and that the
corrupted bloodlines of Khalesh had to be completely exterminated. And exterminated they were, to a large degree. The Inspired largely depopulated the region and leveled its cities — fortified citadels built in manifest zones tied to Irian and Shavarath. All couatl relics that could be found were destroyed, and records of the virtuous victories of the Khaleshites were wiped from history.

The current inhabitants of Khalesh are descended from people resettled from the forgotten nations of the Syrkarn region. The modern people of Khalesh shun the ancient ruins and know that the ancient people were corrupted by the vile spirits in the region.

### At A Glance

* Population: 50,000 (90% humans, 3% shifters, 4% changelings, 2% ogres/ogre mages, 1% other)
* Environments: Temperate plains and desert
* Major Settlements: none
* Planar Elements: Khalesh is suffused with the energies of Irian and Shavarath. It is Irian that fills the land’s people with optimism and draws them toward the light. The influence of Shavarath is slower and more subtle, but over many thousands of years, it produced a culture determined not only to embrace the light, but to battle the darkness. There are some patches where Syrania reaches through, where the dominant mood is one of peace. But for the most part, it's a realm that breeds hope and the willingness to fight for it… two things that proved very dangerous for the Inspired.

### Religion and Culture

Khaleshite crusaders wielded the power of the Silver Flame, but they didn’t call it by that name. They fall under what the Library of Korranberg has defined as a “serpent cult”; their focus was purely on the celestial couatl and their battle against the fiends. Precedent suggests that the Khaleshites must have had their own equivalent of the Voice of the Flame, but few details of the ancient champions remain.

### Art and Architecture

Planar influences aren’t the only supernatural force at play in Khalesh. Glance across a Khalesh plain and you may see what looks to be a giant bone projecting from the earth — a fallen column of something like polished ivory. The locals call these “dragon bones,” saying they’re the bones of Eberron herself. But search further and you may find patches of wall, foundations, or even small buildings formed from this dragonbone. It’s virtually indestructible and seemingly immune to the passage of time. In truth, this isn’t made from the bones of the earth; it’s a building substance used by the ancient couatl, the most numerous of the native celestials of Eberron. Khalesh is one of the places that the couatl came into the world in the Age of Demons, one of the anchors where these immortals would reform if they were destroyed. In a sense, it’s the celestial counterpart to the Demon Wastes of Khorvaire; a place suffused with lingering celestial power.

The humans of Khalesh built their cities on couatl foundations, and Khaleshite champions had visions of the celestial serpents and their great sacrifice to protect the innocent. The couatl graced the banner of Khalesh, and its people took up their ancient battle against fiends. The Khaleshites drew on the power of the Silver Flame and embraced the call to fight supernatural evil. Irian inspired them with hope and the belief that they could build a better world. And Shavarath drove them to fight for that world — to push beyond the purely compassionate aspects of the Silver Flame and to use the sword to battle mortal evil as well as fiends.
