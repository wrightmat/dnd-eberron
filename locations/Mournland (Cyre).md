The Mournland is the shattered remnants of the nation of Cyre, lost to a cataclysm in a single day known as the Day of Mourning.

The borders of the Mournland are easily distinguished by the dead-gray mist that forms a dome around the entire area. To the north, the Mournland touches against the Cyre River coming off of Scions Sound and emptying into Lake Cyre on the Mournland's eastern border. The Brey River marks part of its northwest boundary while its border with Breland is defined by the hanging mist. Similarly in the goblin nation of Darguun the dead-gray mist is a constant reminder of the border of the Mournland. To the south lies Kraken Bay and to the east the Blade Desert of Valenar, the Talenta Plains, and the nation of Karrnath.

On the 20th of Olarune, 994 YK, an unknown magical holocaust wiped out the nation of Cyre. There are conflicting sources about the initial start point and spread of the Mourning, but by day's end most of Cyre was covered in a gray mist and most of the inhabitants within its borders were dead or horrifically transformed. The Mourning did not seem to have an impact on undead and constructs, besides creating new undead, and most warforged also seemed to be unaffected by the mists. The lands inside the Mournland were also transformed; entire cities shifted locations and terrain was raised or lowered, or transformed into glass or other materials.

### Locations

* **The Dead-Grey Mists**. The dead-gray mist is a shroud that hangs over and circumscribes the Mournland. The mist acts as an obscuring fog that prevents a clear view of the mangled landscape; even people on airships can't see through the heavy blanket. The thickness of the mist varies; at its broadest, an adventurer would have to trek 5â€¯miles (8â€¯kilometers) to escape the constricting smoke. A more fortunate explorer could just hold their breath for a couple hundred feet before breaking through to the other side. This, however, is easier said than done, for the dead-gray mist has the ability to muddle one's mind. There are stories of unfortunate souls who found themselves caught in a labyrinth without walls manufactured from their own shattered psyche. Within the Mournland, there are isolated locations where the mist gathers again, but these patches are far less dense and dangerous than the perimeter walls.
* **Dollen on the River** (1).
* **Swoz** (2).
* **Fort Bright** (3).
* **Eston** (4). A small city in Cyre standing beside Lake Arul on the northwestern border, once one of its major cities and now a ruin on the edge of the Mournland. It was once home to the base of operations of House Cannith.
* **Kalazart** (5).
* **Metrol** (6). Called the Rising City, Metrol is the former capital of Galifar and of Cyre, once a great metropolis standing beside the Cyre River on Cyre's eastern border, and now a ruined city lying on the eastern boundary of the Mournland.
* **Tronish** (7).
* **Making** (8). A city of Cyre, once one of its major cities lying near the heart of the kingdom, and now a ruin in the dead center of the Mournland, in the middle of the Glass Plateau.
* **Broken Tower** (9).
* **Greenland** (10).
* **Whitehearth** (11).
* **Barren Keep** (12).
* **Seaside** (13). Called The City of Sails, was a coastal vacation city in southern Cyre, and now a ruin in the Mournland, lying on the shore of Kraken Bay.
* **Shaelas Tiraleth** (14).
* **Field of Ruins** (15).
* **Crimson Water** (16).
* **Jarp** (17).
* **Field of Living Spells**. A battlefield in the Mournland and the last fought in the Last War before the Mourning. They were once rolling plains through which ran the Saerun Road. In the southeast near Kraken Bay were lush hills.
* **Glowing Chasm**. This vast crack in the earth emits a cold purple or violet light that seems to come from impossibly deep underground. Its source is unknown and cannot be seen from the top, and no one who has gone to investigate has been seen alive again. This light can be seen from miles away.
* **Glass Plateau**. A vast highland plateau or tableland, composed entirely of glass. Although it is overall a smooth and flat expanse, there are also spikes, spires, peaks, and other formations of sharp and jagged glass protruding from the floor in places seemingly at random. They resemble blown glass and can grow to huge sizes and some are bewildering and incomprehensible in shape. Near the cener, the glass is black, being obsidian, but as one gets closer to the edges, the glass starts to get lighter in color and more transparent, becoming pale. At the edge of the plateau are jagged cliffs where the glass is nearly white. These separate the lowlands from the top of the plateau and stand around 100 feet (30 meters) high. Occasionally, deep in the dark obsidian there can be glimpsed fiery flashes of light and liquid glass and even lava can be exuded near the edges.

### DM Notes

* In Campaign 1, we established that the Day of Mourning was a result of an initial test of the first Spelljammer engine by House Cannith.
