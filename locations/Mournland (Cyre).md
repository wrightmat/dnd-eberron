The Mournland is the shattered remnants of the nation of Cyre, lost to a cataclysm in a single day known as the Day of Mourning.

The borders of the Mournland are easily distinguished by the dead-gray mist that forms a dome around the entire area. To the north, the Mournland touches against the Cyre River coming off of Scions Sound and emptying into Lake Cyre on the Mournland's eastern border. The Brey River marks part of its northwest boundary while its border with Breland is defined by the hanging mist. Similarly in the goblin nation of Darguun the dead-gray mist is a constant reminder of the border of the Mournland. To the south lies Kraken Bay and to the east the Blade Desert of Valenar, the Talenta Plains, and the nation of Karrnath.

On the 20th of Olarune, 994 YK, an unknown magical holocaust wiped out the nation of Cyre. There are conflicting sources about the initial start point and spread of the Mourning, but by day's end most of Cyre was covered in a gray mist and most of the inhabitants within its borders were dead or horrifically transformed. The Mourning did not seem to have an impact on undead and constructs, besides creating new undead, and most warforged also seemed to be unaffected by the mists. The lands inside the Mournland were also transformed; entire cities shifted locations and terrain was raised or lowered, or transformed into glass or other materials.

### Characters

* **[[Lord of Blades (Aaren dâ€™Cannith)]]** (LE male warforged artificer).
* **[[Ikar the Black]]** (NE male half-orc salvager).
* **[[Kazdurakashtan (Haze-of-Death)]]** (CE male white dragon).

### Locations

* **The Dead-Grey Mists**. The dead-gray mist is a shroud that hangs over and circumscribes the Mournland. The mist acts as an obscuring fog that prevents a clear view of the mangled landscape; even people on airships can't see through the heavy blanket. The thickness of the mist varies; at its broadest, an adventurer would have to trek 5â€¯miles (8â€¯kilometers) to escape the constricting smoke. A more fortunate explorer could just hold their breath for a couple hundred feet before breaking through to the other side. This, however, is easier said than done, for the dead-gray mist has the ability to muddle one's mind. There are stories of unfortunate souls who found themselves caught in a labyrinth without walls manufactured from their own shattered psyche. Within the Mournland, there are isolated locations where the mist gathers again, but these patches are far less dense and dangerous than the perimeter walls.
* **Dollen on the River** (1).
* **Swoz** (2).
* **Fort Bright** (3).
* **Eston** (4). A small city in Cyre standing beside Lake Arul on the northwestern border, once one of its major cities and now a ruin on the edge of the Mournland. It was once home to the base of operations of House Cannith.
* **Kalazart** (5).
* **Metrol** (6). Called the Rising City, Metrol is the former capital of Galifar and of Cyre, once a great metropolis standing beside the Cyre River on Cyre's eastern border, and now a ruined city lying on the eastern boundary of the Mournland.
* **Tronish** (7).
* **Making** (8). A city of Cyre, once one of its major cities lying near the heart of the kingdom, and now a ruin in the dead center of the Mournland, in the middle of the Glass Plateau.
* **Broken Tower** (9).
* **Greenland** (10).
* **Whitehearth** (11).
* **Barren Keep** (12).
* **Seaside** (13). Called The City of Sails, was a coastal vacation city in southern Cyre, and now a ruin in the Mournland, lying on the shore of Kraken Bay.
* **Shaelas Tiraleth** (14).
* **Field of Ruins** (15).
* **Crimson Water** (16).
* **Jarp** (17).
* **Field of Living Spells**. A battlefield in the Mournland and the last fought in the Last War before the Mourning. They were once rolling plains through which ran the Saerun Road. In the southeast near Kraken Bay were lush hills.
* **Glowing Chasm**. This vast crack in the earth emits a cold purple or violet light that seems to come from impossibly deep underground. Its source is unknown and cannot be seen from the top, and no one who has gone to investigate has been seen alive again. This light can be seen from miles away.
* **Glass Plateau**. A vast highland plateau or tableland, composed entirely of glass. Although it is overall a smooth and flat expanse, there are also spikes, spires, peaks, and other formations of sharp and jagged glass protruding from the floor in places seemingly at random. They resemble blown glass and can grow to huge sizes and some are bewildering and incomprehensible in shape. Near the cener, the glass is black, being obsidian, but as one gets closer to the edges, the glass starts to get lighter in color and more transparent, becoming pale. At the edge of the plateau are jagged cliffs where the glass is nearly white. These separate the lowlands from the top of the plateau and stand around 100 feet (30 meters) high. Occasionally, deep in the dark obsidian there can be glimpsed fiery flashes of light and liquid glass and even lava can be exuded near the edges.

### Universal Properties

**Healing**. Healing - by spells, potions, or natural means - is demonstrably diminished, or even ineffective altogether. There are a few notable exceptions to the Mournland's healing inefficacy. Paladins can perform their Lay on Hand ritual normally, and monks, who have extraordinary control over their own bodies, are able to mend their own wounds but not those of others. Lastly, goodberries, created by druids and rangers, remain a viable healing method, though the difficulty of keeping fresh berries suitable for the spell, as well as the near impossibility of finding edible fruit within the Mournland, makes them scarce comfort. Many explorers have taken to carrying quantities of goodberry wine, a fruity drink with little alcoholic content that retains, and even enhances, the effects of goodberry.

**Resting**. The magical apocalypse that created the Mournland had more effect on the living (and unliving) inhabitants of what was once Cyre than can be documented. Almost everything and everyone there is completely suffused with strange, unpredictable magics. Those brave enough to travel through the Mournland quickly find that they are also not exempt from its effects. One consequence of these magics is that natural healing takes significantly longer here than elsewhere. Instead of 1 hour, a short rest takes 8 hours, and a long rest takes 3 entire days.

**Spellcasting (Optional)**. Each time a spell is cast within the Mournland, whether an attack against another creature or not, the player rolls a d20. Just like with a melee attack, the spell has the possibility of a critical success or failure. On a 20, one of the spell's effects is doubled - damage, duration, area of effect, or number of targets - chosen by the DM. If a 1 is rolled, the spell has no effect and the spell slot is lost. If material components are called for, they are also consumed.

**Weather**. While dangerous, the dead-gray mists arenâ€™t as actively harmful as the storms that roam the expanses of the Mournland. These storms are as unpredictable in their composition as they are in their frequency and scope. Precipitation comes in the form of everything from normal water to caustic acid toâ€¦ other substances.
It is up to the DM to decide whether, or how often, their party encounters a storm while adventuring in the Mournland. Storms can be important story-telling moments, or present challenges for the characters that canâ€™t be solved with sword strokes. Use the following system to create random storms, or serve as inspiration for creating your own. Consider your partyâ€™s ability to mitigate the damage before unleashing a day-long, severe, regional storm of acid and lightning â€” or some other particularly deadly horror.

**Damage Types**:
- **Acid**: acid
- **Blood and mucus**: (optional) DM can choose necrotic, psychic, or even have characters make saving throws against diseases if desired.
- **Body parts:** (optional) bludgeoning
- **Freezing wind**: cold
- **Hail**: bludgeoning
- **Lightning**: lightning
- **Sand**: slashing

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* In Campaign 1, we established that the Day of Mourning was a result of an initial test of the first Spelljammer engine by House Cannith.
