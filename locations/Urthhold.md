Urthhold is a small coastal town that grew around a barely maintained road that connects it to the capital city of Zarash'ak. The aroma of fetid swamp mixed with sea air is all around you as you step off the dock. A couple of small buildings surround Rathkann Square in the center of town, including a shop, a meat market, and a blacksmith. Just west of town, several large stones can be seen on the horizon.

### Characters

- **Vilberg Dargakk** (male half-orc). Shopkeeper.
- **Gilbert** (male half-orc). Meat market owner.
- **Mumpena Daergel** (female half-orc). Blacksmith.
- **Boruk "Ironfist" Vonn** (male half-orc). The dockmaster, and a towering half-orc with a muscular build, standing at 6'5". His skin is a dark green, marred with scars from old battles and accidents at the docks. His most distinctive feature is his right arm, which has been replaced with a finely crafted iron prosthetic, giving him the nickname "Ironfist." His eyes are a piercing amber, always scanning the docks with a watchful gaze. He often wears a leather vest and sturdy boots, suitable for the rugged work of a dockmaster. Boruk is known for his stern and no-nonsense attitude. He runs the docks with an iron fist, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

### Locations

- **Vilberg's Low-Cost Shop**. A shabby shop with a straw roof. Inside, the small building is tidy, but you notice the shelves are looking a bit bare. The store's half-orc shopkeep is currently sharpening a knife, but he smiles and greets you as you walk in, introducing himself as Vilberg Dargakk.
- **Friendly Gilbert's Meat Market**. A cobblestone building with a decently built white tiled roof. Several large hunks of meat hang from hooks in the ceiling. This meat shop is known for oversalting all their meats to mask the age. Gilbert, a diminutive male half-orc with very tiny ears, sells 1 lb of meat for 1 sp.
- **The Polished Smoke**. The smithy is fastidious, with a swept floor and tools stored neatly on the walls. There's a desk in the corner with a piece of parchment showing a current project's measurements, and the materials are neatly stored in bins. Clearly, whatever apprentice has been charged with upkeep of the smithy has taken their job very seriously. Mumpena the blacksmith moves around the shop, unsure of herself, betraying her lack of skills.
