In the days of the old kingdoms, the ogres of Borunan were peerless warriors. Their champions possessed inhuman strength, martial discipline, unshakable courage, and weapons forged in Fernian flame. Time and again, they repelled the legions of Nulakesh and the crusaders of Khalesh, and yet Borunan never sought to conquer any of its neighbors. Some might wonder why this was. Borunan is a harsh land; did the ogres never consider claiming the more fertile fields of Nulakesh? What kept their population so low that they never needed to expand?

Despite the might of its champions, Borunan was easily laid low by the Dreaming Dark. The humans of the surrounding regions had long feared the ogres, and it was easy for the quori to fan these flames. Within Borunan itself, the quori sowed doubts and created feuds, shattering centuries of unity. ‚ÄúAre the oni secretly in league with devils? Was the battle for Gul Dol a pointless sacrifice?‚Äù Civil strife decimated Borunan and left it vulnerable to outside attack.

In the Age of the Dreaming Dark, the ogres of Borunan were kept from the wild zones that served as the strongholds of their ancestors. They're also largely kept from any form of war; they used their strength for manual labor as opposed to battle. The oni were raised to believe in a twisted form of their actual history, taught that their gifts were the result of being living prisons for fiends. Thus, it's the duty of the oni to redeem the fiend within them through their own devoted service to the Inspired. Largely, this indoctrination had proven successful, and the Horned Guard ‚Äî an elite corps of oni soldiers ‚Äî was one of the most powerful weapons in the Riedran arsenal.

After the Second Sundering, a once rebel group known as the Horned Shadow (established to protect ogre-kin (ogres, oni, eneko)) fought to bring order to Borunan once again.

### At A Glance

* Population: 496,000 (80% ogres, 8% humans, 5% ogre mages, 3% shifters, 2% half-giants, 2% other)
* Environments: Warm desert, temperate mountains
* Major Settlements: Mokush (an ogre village)
* Planar Elements: Borunan contains several wild zones tied to Fernia and Shavarath, along with multiple passages into Khyber. The center of Borunan contains a wild zone to Shavarath where a fragment of the Eternal Battleground extends directly into the Material Plane. So the ancient ogres devoted their might not to conquest, but to defending this keep ‚Äî known to the ogres as Gul Dol, the Gate of War ‚Äî against the forces of tyranny. In addition to being fierce warriors, the oni of Borunan forged their weapons in the Cauldron, a wild zone tied to Fernia.

### Religion and Culture

The ogres of ancient Borunan cared nothing for the Sovereigns or the Silver Flame ‚Äî they were entirely devoted to the battle for Gul Dol. The angels of the Legion of Freedom battle the devils of the Legion of Tyranny for control of this massive fortress, which is broken into multiple rings and wings. The angels believe that the balance of this war reflects the balance between tyranny and freedom across the multiverse. Of course, this is only one of countless fronts in the eternal war between these forces, but the ogres embraced this idea and believed that in fighting alongside the angels, they were fighting for freedom for all people.

### Development

* During the Quiet Year, a buried statue was accidentally unearthed by a small boy named Rask. This eventually led to the excavation of an entire buried city by the now adult archeologist Rask and his team. The ogre mages took interest and started helping, ultimately finding a temple containing a large gemstone inside (which was later identified as a Khyber dragonshard with the help of the Syrks).
* After fully excavating a mountain cave in which to establish a city, Borunan traded the excavated stone as building materials to Pyrine in exchange for access to fishing.
