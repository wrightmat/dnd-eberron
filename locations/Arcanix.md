> As you soar upward, you see four castles, each floating on a rocky island thousands of feet above the verdant fields of Aundair. Each castle is a crazy-quilt of different architectural styles, each more outlandish than the last. Periodic flashes of light illuminate the windows, and every so often a gout of flame or eldritch energy bursts forth from a door or chimney.

Arcanix is a farming village in the nation of Aundair, located on the shores of Lake Galifar. It is also the home to an institute of arcane studies. Many of the greatest wizards of Galifar learned their craft within the Floating Towers of Arcanix. Raulo ir‚ÄôTrannick is the lord mayor of Arcanix and a member of the Arcane Congress which is the local government responsible for the University and the surrounding village.

Most of the important wizards and sorcerers of Khorvaire reside in Arcanix. Tower students and professors are renowned for both their abstract magical theory as well as practical spellcasting. Being the largest and most famous University in Eberron, the Floating Towers offers instruction in any form of magical application that one can imagine and pursues groundbreaking research that promises to shape the future.

The Arcane Congress devotes two of the towers, Glarehold and Amberwall, to training the next generation of magewrights and wizards. Nocturnas and Skyreach, the other two towers, are the residences, libraries, and laboratories of Arcane Congress members. From these two towers the Congress advises the Aundairian crown on magical matters and schemes against its rivals, the Twelve.

### Characters

* **Raulo ir‚ÄôTrannick** (LN male human wizard). Member of Arcanix's Arcane Congress, with a special role as the administrator of the school's application exams. He is also the patriarch of the noble house of Trannick and serves as lord mayor of the city of Arcanix. As his family runs a hippogriff transport business, he is known for using a hippogriff to travel between the floating towers and the ground. His family is a well-established landholding family in the region around Lake Galifar. These various titles and holdings provide ir'Trannick and his house with a great deal of prestige, and he tends to be the person who greets new wizards visiting Arcanix.
* **Tanila** (LG female half-elf sorcerer). The half-elf sorcerer Robideur died more than 450 years ago, but his descendant Tanila is the head librarian. The library forbids checking out books even to the most powerful members of the Arcane Congress; examination of a book at one of the library‚Äôs oak desks is the only option. Tanila has an initial attitude of unfriendly toward anyone who even asks about checking out a book, and she won‚Äôt bend the rules unless her attitude is improved to helpful. Tanila was Windsor Stone‚Äôs boss when he worked at the library during his time at Arcanix.
* **Flo** (non-binary changeling professor). Changeling Transmuter, mind seeded, never uses their true identity. They possess an old tome on transmutation magic that is annotated and scribbled into by Mordain d'Phiarlan (now known by as The Fleshweaver). Often appears as:
	- Leandre d'Vadalis, a male magebreeder looking to enhance and create new life forms.
	- Iorek, a male Darguun Goblin Artificer wanting to find Dhakanni relics to be inspired by their designs in his creations.
	- Kathra Silveraxe, a female Mror Dwarf 'rune knight' (reskinned to Daelkyr) interested by symbionts and Daelkyr magic.
* **Frederic** (male human professor). Head professor of Arcana and Artifacts. He will sometimes reach out to former students who have moved into the life of adventurer in order to seek out powerful or especially dangerous to obtain artifacts. He served as a patron for Windsor Locke.
* **Jasmine Goldwine** (female halfling professor). Halfling Diviner, interested by the planes and the Draconic Prophecy, she's trying to re-establish the Planar Observatories in the Eldeen Reaches that the Arcane Congress lost contact with once the Reaches separated from Aundair. She's noticing that more Wild Manifest Zones are appearing in the Eldeen Reaches. Her familiar, a Tressym called Pandora, is actually the Chamber agent named Yllosavax - a silver dragon observer focused on the advancement of arcane research on Khorvaire as it relates to the Draconic Prophecy.
* **Miromi** (female kalashtar artificer). Abjuration and Artificy professor, and renowned archeologist.
* **Old Mark** (LG male elf paladin). The groundskeeper of the Arcane Congress, a polite and extremely deferential man with shaky hands and an endless stream of warm remarks and non-judgmental support. The more anxious students love him and he often has a small following as he wanders through the Congress with his clippers, tending to trees and singing old songs. Mark is an avowed pacifist and never retaliates even when the richer and snootier students spit upon him or the other servants push their worst chores onto him. He works happily for hours and hours well in to the night, in fact if one watches carefully, he seems to try to avoid going to sleep. Groundskeeper Mark is better known to history as Marianus the Purging Flame, one of the original Council of Deacons who planned and approved the Silver Crusade (now known as the lycanthrope purge), he fought on the front lines for years, slaughtering monster after monster, until the wildheart was sealed again. During the victory celebration the official history is he was savagely killed by a lurking wererat, the truth is he simply wandered off (the church being too embarrassed to admit they lost a paladin of his caliber). The horrors he saw, the horrors he committed, it broke something in him and the Deacon Marianus became the migrant worker Mark. Now years later he has settled in to his roll in the Arcane Congress living a pious and humble life beset every night by the horrors of war. Marius has sworn to remain ‚ÄúMark‚Äù for the rest of his remaining few years, but his oaths as a paladin are older and deeper, if something truly terrible were to occur, if the forces of darkness assaulted the Arcane Congress, then they might just meet a paladin shrouded in silver flame.
* **Windsor Stone** (LG male human barbarian). Once a student of Arcanix long ago, Windsor returned to become a professor after a career as an adventurer where he was one of the first to visit wildspace. While he lives in Stormhome and returns there frequently, he also spends a lot of time at Arcanix, especially at the Gate of Xabra where he now specializes in gate travel.

### Locations

#### Village of Arcanix

This village of 800 people lies directly beneath the floating towers. The residents of Arcanix owe their livelihoods to the Arcane Congress, from the innkeeper who boards the parents of would-be wizards during the Autumn Entrance Examinations to the stablemaster responsible for exercising the steeds ‚Äî both mundane and exotic ‚Äî of some Arcane Congress spellcasters.

Most of the important wizards and sorcerers of the Arcane Congress live in the floating towers themselves, but a few reside in Arcanix. Raulo ir‚ÄôTrannick, for example, is the lord mayor of Arcanix and a member of the Arcane Congress. His family has long had holdings on the southeastern banks of Lake Galifar, and his position as Trannick patriarch demands he live earthbound and board a hippogriff when he‚Äôs needed for the business of the Congress. Raulo and other members of the Trannick family are the proctors of the Autumn Entrance Exams, determining which of Aundair‚Äôs brightest will get a chance to become magewrights and wizards. Raulo also serves as a de facto ambassador between the Arcane Congress and any wizards who arrive at Ar can ix unannounced.

The Trannick family offers trained hippogriffs that can ascend to the floating towers for visitors unable to get there under their own power. The Trannicks collect a 25 gp per person transit fee, which they use to fund scholarships for deserving young mages.

Arcanix‚Äôs unique position makes it one of the Five Nations‚Äô most magically aware places. Many of the residents are downright blas√© about powerful arcane magic, while others take great delight in the astonishment on visitors‚Äô faces when a carpet of flying alights on the town square or an aged wizard turns into a glorious dragon and flies away.

#### Floating Towers of Arcanix

Arcanix is divided between four major schools that occupy the first two towers, and are each run by a head professor:

| School                           | Head Professor   | Tower     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Abjuration and Artificy          | Miromi           | Glarehold |
| Arcana and Artifacts             | Frederic         | Glarehold |
| Divination and Draconic Prophesy | Jasmine Goldwine | Amberwall |
| Transmutation and Conjuration    | Flo              | Amberwall |

Everburning torches light every corner of the floating towers, unless a member of the Congress has a specific reason to prefer darkness. Some everburning torches burst into flame only when someone enters the room, dousing themselves instantly when the room is vacant. Others burn with strangely colored flame, adding a bluish or reddish tint to everything they illuminate. The floating towers are a quiet place; distracting noise is conducive to neither study nor political machinations. The temperature is always mild within the floating towers, no matter what is happening outside.

The Arcane Congress built the floating towers over eight hundred years, so their walls have known many architects, both mundane and magical. Within the floating towers, there‚Äôs always a strong aura of transmutation (the spells that keep the towers aloft) and at least one other aura.

Arcane architects aren‚Äôt constrained by the square footage within the floating towers‚Äô walls; some rooms exist extradimensionally, and each tower has far more space on the inside than a conventionally made castle would. In general, the floating towers have smooth stone floors, superior masonry walls, and 15-foot-high wood-paneled ceilings (with 30-foot-high vaulted ceilings in particularly large chambers). There‚Äôs no consistency to the doors within the Towers.

The floating towers are too vast to completely map, and such map would be out of date by the time it was completed. Especially in Nocturnas and Skyreach, the wizards are always making magic alterations to their demesnes.

##### Glarehold
One of the two towers devoted to training future spellcasters, including student residences. It is also home to the White Arch, where new students will often enter the academy for the first time.

##### Amberwall
The second of the towers dedicated to students. In its lowest depths is the Maze of Shadowy Terror, a maze whose purpose is to teach students humility by testing their powers. The maze often serves as a final test for would-be graduates, though it is also used informally by students looking to prove themselves.

##### Nocturnas
This is one of two towers that serves as a home and personal study for members of the Arcane Congress, including their personal laboratories and libraries. They often live here while advising Aundair on matters related to magic and their rivalry with the Twelve. In its center is Adal's Demesne, which houses Adal ir'Wynarn, Minister of Magic to Aundair and Queen Aurala's brother. Near the top is the tower's observatory and a series of menhirs known as the Gate of Xabra. Finally, Nocturnas is the location of secret labs where Adal ir'Wynarn and his staff attempt to create weapons of war.

##### Skyreach
Much like Nocturnas, Skyreach is home to members of the Arcane Congress. Unlike Nocturnas, it is also the location of the Five Nations' greatest store of arcane lore, the Library of Robideur, which takes up four stories of Skyreach's tallest tower.

##### Tower of Alchemy
Arcanix is home to the Tower of Alchemy, one of the Five Nations‚Äô premier colleges for the alchemical arts. Its senior mentor, Tzandro Kavalant, has created the alchemical golems that act as servants and guardians within the floating towers.

##### The White Arch
Visitors to the floating towers often ascend (via magic or the Trannicks‚Äô hippogriffs) to Glarehold Tower, where an outcropping of rock has a massive white marble arch that leads to a white marble courtyard. The White Arch is also the traditional gateway that new students use when they begin their studies; many an Aundairian youth dreams of walking under the white arch, clad in the brown robes of a first-year student.

The courtyard beyond the White Arch is the largest outdoor space on any of the four floating towers. Magically animated topiaries in the shape of boars stand at the corners of the courtyard.

##### Library of Robideur
Near the top of Skyreach is one of Khorvaire‚Äôs finest collections of arcane lore ‚Äî although librarians in Korranberg would argue the point, and who knows what dark lore lurks in the libraries of Ashtakala?

The library takes up the top four floors of Skyreach‚Äôs tallest spire, with bookshelves running from floor to ceiling. Only the doors and the stained-glass windows interrupt the walls crammed with spellbooks, tomes, and grimoires. A unique spell not unlike unseen servant controls the books within the library. An arcanist of the Arcane Congress need only state the title and author of a book, and it slides from its shelf, opens wide, then slowly descends to the arcanist‚Äôs waiting hands, lazily flapping its cover open and shut in imitation of a bird.

The half-elf sorcerer Robideur died more than 450 years ago, but his descendant Tanila (LG half-elf female sorcerer 8) is the head librarian. The library forbids checking out books even to the most powerful members of the Arcane Congress; examination of a book at one of the library‚Äôs oak desks is the only option. Tanila has an initial attitude of unfriendly toward anyone who even asks about checking out a book, and she won‚Äôt bend the rules unless her attitude is improved to helpful.

##### Adal's Demesne
At the center of Nocturnas are a series of chambers that Adal ir'Wynarn, Royal Minister of Magic and brother to Queen Aurala, calls home. Adal (described on page 18) splits his time between the floating towers and his palace at Fairhaven. He regards the floating towers as a place where he can be free of court intrigues and free to direct his staff as they conduct magical research and build weapons of arcane destruction to defend Aundair or extend its reach.

Adal is more politically connected than most of the Arcane Congress. He has the queen‚Äôs ear at a moment‚Äôs notice (although the trust between them is far from complete). Adal isn‚Äôt a great wizard in his own right, but he‚Äôs a consummate power broker and charismatic leader. Most of the researchers on his staff are higher-level wizards than he is, and the many agents in Adal‚Äôs employ are likewise among the most elite in Aundair.

At any one given time, Adal has three or four major research or weapon-development programs under way within his chambers. Each is kept separate from the others, and only Adal knows the extent and progress of all the programs. One team might be trying to reverse-engineer House Cannith‚Äôs creation pattern for warforged. Another team works on a system of weather control, and a third is breeding wyverns that shoot fiery rays from their tails.

##### Maze of Shadowy Terrors
In the lowest level of Amberwall Tower is a maze intended to humble young apprentices confident of their ability to meet any threat with magic. The Maze of Shadowy Terror spontaneously generates monsters with a shadow conjuration effect.

The Amberwall instructors intended that the maze, which looks like a typical set of twisting dungeon corridors, serve as a final test for wizards and sorcerers before they head out into the world or become members of the Arcane Congress. But brave and foolhardy students eager to prove themselves are always sneaking into the basement and entering the maze on their own.

##### Gate of Xabra
The Arcanix towers house strange artifacts and relics, but few compare in size and scope to the Gate of Xabra. A circle of menhirs sits atop one of the residential towers. The standing stones, and indeed the very earth they rest upon, came to Arcanix from an ancient Q‚Äôbarran ruin ages ago after the mages discovered that the stones could bridge the planes. On each stone is a magic rune. When the stones are activated in a specific sequence, everything inside the ring is whisked to another plane. Concentrated research has uncovered a few sequences so far, sometimes with disastrous results, but the studies continue.

When a would-be traveler uses a finger to trace certain glyphs on the stones, they glow slightly. When all the correct glyphs are lit, everything within the Gate of Xabra disappears and a whoosh of air fills the void that remains. Finding the correct sequence of glyphs is no easy task. Fortunately, failed attempts don‚Äôt have negative consequences ‚Äî or at least they haven‚Äôt so far. The glyph sequence can‚Äôt be learned by rote, because the correct glyph sequence depends on both the destination plane and the alignment of the stars around Eberron.

The Gate of Xabra only opens for an instant, although in most cases it leaves a circular impression on the other plane that allows a return trip. Travelers appear within the circle at the moment they arrive; once they step back inside it, they reappear in the gate chamber in Nocturnas. On the plane of Irian, the return circle might be marked with crystals, while it might be a circular glade on the forest plane of Lamannia.
