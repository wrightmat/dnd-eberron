Stormreach is a small frontier city nestled on the eastern coast of the Skyfall Peninsula in Xen'drik. Despite its small population, Stormreach is an important city because of its location, allowing easy docking access to travelers wishing to enter Xen'drik. The city also acts as a center for trade and commerce for all who visit the lost continent of Xen'drik. Stormreach is known by some as the "City of Dungeons" because it was built atop an ancient city from the long-lost civilization of giants.

The Stormreach Compact was an agreement made between the Kingdom of Galifar and a collection of pirate leaders called the Storm Lords in 800 YK. The compact gave legal authority over the city of Stormreach to the Storm Lords. It also established the powers each Storm Lord would have based on their family line. As a minor note, the compact also codified several statutes that applied to everyone in city.

### Characters

* **Jonas Wylkes** (CN male half-elf sorcerer). Harbor Lord, and a young noble more interested in enjoying his wealth than maintaining a tight leash on the affairs of the harbor wards.
* **Varen Lassite** (LN male human rogue). Coin Lord, and a brilliant administrator wanted for murder in Sharn.
* **Yorrick Amanatu** (LE male dwarf sorcerer). Coin Lord, and rakshasha agent of the Lords of Dust.
* **Kirris Sel Shadra** (LE female gnome). Coin Lord, who has sympathies with the Blood of Vol.
* **Paulo Omaren** (NG female human artificer). Coin Lord, and outcast member of House Cannith seeking redeption in the eyes of the house.

* **Hes** (NE male changeling wererat rogue). Priest of the Traveler and Bilge Rat member.
* **Little Del** (NE female halfling wererat wizard). Uses her illusionist spells to hide the Bilge Rat's gang activities.
* **Ereg** (NE male human ranger). A retired hunter, Ereg has tracked many of the strange creatures of Xen'drik — the wilder the better. On one of his forays into the jungle, the hunter uncovered a book describing the foundations of the necromantic tradition that has since evolved into the Blood of Vol. Ereg is fascinated by the book and spends his days studying its tattered pages.
* **Gaulronak** (N male hill giant druid). The oldest inhabitant of the Tents of Rushemeé, Gaulronak is a wizened, elderly giant who scours the nearby jungle for rare herbs and fruit. He sells his gleanings to herbalists and cooks from a tent near the city gates, and he also serves as the primary liaison between the Storm Lords and the giants of Rushemé. Gaulronak has come to understand the people of Stormreach, and the giants respect his age and wisdom.
* **Hassalac Chaar** (N male kobold sorcerer). This self-styled "Prince of Dragons” might well be the most powerful spellcaster in Stormreach, but his reclusive nature makes it impossible to know for certain. Hassalae Chaar is a kobold who lives in a hidden complex deep beneath the city. The precise location of his lair is a mystery, since the only known entrance is an extradimensional portal that the kobold controls. Hassalac is fascinated with dragons and has amassed a vast assortment of maps, magic items, and even artifacts dating back beyond the dragon-giant conflict to the dragons’ war against the fiends. Hassalac’s vaults might contain wealth beyond measure, but they are also filled with deadly traps and lizardfolk guards. Hassalac jealously guards his hoard and rarely leaves his lair, but he sometimes employs adventurers to retrieve relics from the interior of Xen'drik.
* **Valexa Von Ruthvek** (N female gnome magewright). Proprietor of Von Ruthvek's Splendors of the South in the Marketplace District.
* **Salkarath** (N male sahuagin). The bartender and owner of the Wavecrest Tavern. Salkarath stands out with his deep green scales, sharp teeth, and piercing yellow eyes, yet his demeanor is surprisingly amiable, at least to those who show him and his establishment respect. He keeps his tavern oddly clean and is known for serving a variety of exotic drinks, most of which incorporate ingredients only found in the depths of the ocean.
* **Tarnik Graysail** (NG male human). Once a renowned guide of Xen'drik's jungles, Tarnik now spends his days sharing tales over drinks at Molou's Distillery. His weather-beaten face and keen eyes speak of a life of adventure, and he's always ready to offer advice or a warning to those brave enough to explore the wilds he once navigated.

### Locations

#### Harbor District

In any port city the harbor is a center of all the settlement's activity and Stormreach is no exception. The Harbor area is dominated by three large structures: the Emperor statue and the Lighthouse, both from the Age of Giants, and the impressive Harbormaster's House where the Harbor Lord lives and performs his duties. Many pirates and other nefarious types also call the Harbor home making this a frequent stop for visitors.

The ancient ruins upon which the city of Stormreach are built extend well beneath the water line of the harbor, forming an area known as the Underharbor. These dank, dark, damp, and often water-filled ruins are home to numerous sahuagin, pirates, thieves, murderers, and other creatures of the depths. The Stormreach Guard and the dragonmarked houses like to keep a close watch on the entrances to the Underharbor.

* **The Emperor** (4). 
* **Harbormaster's House** (5). Where Jonas Wylkes resides.
* **The Leaky Dinghy** (6). A totally reputable boat rental place that definitely has boats that float.
* **The Lighthouse** (7).
* **Shargon's Talon** (8). 
* **The Waterworks** (9). 
* **Wavecrest Tavern** (10). A seedy half-underwater bar that tailors to sahuagin and other less-than-reputables.

#### Marketplace District

The large central district of the port of Stormreach in Xen'drik. The district contains a large market and many shops, as befits its name. The Marketplace district is governed by the Lassites, a Storm Lord family. It lies adjacent to the Cross district and Dannel's Pride.

* **The Bazaar** (11). 
	* **The Pestle**. alchemical supplies
	* **Far Davandi**. clothing
	* **Tooth and Nail**. exotic beasts
	* **Big Bronau's Boat**. entertainment
	* **Shadows**. entertainment
	* **Forgotten Places**. expedition gear
	* **Havulak Prospecting**. expedition gear
	* **The Thrifty Traveler**. expedition gear
	* **House Tharashk Enclave**. inquisitives
	* **Stormreach Forge**. weapons, armor
* **Black Iron** (12). Primarily a smithy, Black Iron also deals in a variety of goods designed for Large and Huge creatures. It is a center for trade with the giants living in the outlying tent city of Rushemé, and it provides adventurers with a place to unload treasures of unusual size found in the ruins of Xen'drik. A family of half-giants runs Black Iron. The venerable patriarch Hular (N male half-giant magewright) is a master smith, but age is taking its toll on him. His youngest daughter Solarea (CG female half-giant fighter) has the spirit of an adventurer. She might seek to join parties investigating the ruins of the giants or strike out on her own in a quest to steal a husband from the half-giants of Dar Qat.
* **The Chapterhouse** (13). A joint venture of House Phiarlan and House Ghallanda, this squat structure serves as tavern, hostel, and performance space. It provides inexpensive accommodations and some of the best entertainment the city has to offer. Of course. information can also be bought and sold at the Chapterhouse. The hostel almost always has rooms available at a decent price, the only drawback being that if you're staying at the Chapterhouse, you can be certain someone knows exactly what you're up to.
* **The Falconer’s Spire** (14). An airship docking tower in the eastern area of the district.
* **Lorsmarch Palace** (15). 
* **Molou's Distillery** (16). A smelly distillery with cracked cisterns and patchwork metal tanks. Molou's makes kuryeva, a potent gin made from the berries of Xen'drik's kuryeva bush. Kuryeva is popular both in the coastal cities of southern Khorvaire and with sailors at sea. Molou's has a taproom where drinkers can have their kuryeva straight from the tanks. Only those with debilitating cravings for the drink spend much time here, though: the sickly-sweet odor of the fermenting liquor drives most patrons away. Molou's regulars include a number of failed prospectorsand adventurers, many of whom saw things in the jungle that only kuryeva can help them forget.
* **Stormreach Recruiters** (17). Characters handy with a sword and willing to follow the Storm Lords’ orders without question can easily find a place in the Stormreach Guard. The pay is 3 sp per day (6 sp for officers), but many guards supplement their income through graft and bribery. Anyone who joins the Guard and completes the three-month training camp has all past crimes wiped away: most change their names to reflect this new beginning. The Storm Lords have extradited criminals before, but they stand by the Stormreach Guard, As long as members of the Guard serve the Lords faithfully, they can leave their pasts behind.
* **Von Ruthvek's Splendors of the South** (18). Valexa Von Ruthvek (N female gnome wizard) is one of Stormreach’s best-known antiquities dealers, able to identify even the most puzzling items uncovered among the giant ruins. She keeps a wide array of magic items and other curiosities in her store, all under lock, bar, and magical ward to deter thieves. Von Ruthvek offers magic item identification services for the usual rates, but she often pays PCs for a full expedition report if she is interested in finding out more about a particular relic the party has found.

#### Forgelight District

Forgelight is a heavily-rebuilt district with many new buildings and clean, well-off businesses. It is known by many in Stormreach to be a stronghold of Deneith House Deneith which maintains an enclave on the across a branch of the Koronoo from the city proper. Mercenaries and adventurers of all sorts are attracted to the district because of the enclave and because of the large warforged population that makes its home here. Warforged may appreciate the relative quiet of Forgelight or the Stormreach Forge which is also here.

* **The Foundry** (1).
* **House Deneith Enclave** (2).
* **Temple of the Sovereign Host** (3).

#### Cross District

The district of Cross holds a number of transplanted Khorvairian populations and retains some of the pride of its home nations, though there is plenty of tarnish on it. It is a centralized district which gives Cross its name: the Marketplace to the west, the Harbor to the east, Southwatch to the south, and Respite and Silverwall to the north. Despite this, most of the residents of Cross are poor and rely on business elsewhere in the city while trade wagons and travelers pass through without stopping. The ward of Dannel's Pride is a place where travelers keep their heads down the most, filled with the nostalgia and anger of its Cyran population about the Day of Mourning. By contrast, Graystone is an orderly place of business with a bustling Tharashk refinery at its center. Many workers live in the quiet streets of Saltire where very few have reason to go except for the simple or clandestine of the district's population. Lastly, the Sloths is a ward of fine tailors and Brelish expatriates who avidly take advantage of any opportunity for advancing their business.

* **Dannel's Pride**. Known locally as Little Cyre, Dannel's Pride is a ward in the Cross district of Stormreach. Inhabited by its refugees, it is a small survivor of the lost nation of Cyre. A small ward built around a former trading outpost, Dannel's Pride has become heavily populated with Cyran refugees, leading to overcrowding, poverty, and attendant troubles. Maimed veterans of the Last War and hungry children are familiar sights here. Though they have little but broken dreams, the people here endeavor to preserve and rebuild Cyre, right here in Stormreach. They will hotly defend their efforts.
* **Greystone**. 
* **Saltire**. 
* **Stormhaven**. 
* **The Sloths**. 

#### Respite District

Respite is the wealthiest of Stormreach's districts, particularly the ward of Stormhaven which takes up a small part of it. Wealthy merchants make their homes here, the most powerful in Stormhaven including the Storm Lords, and the commoners of Stormreach are forcibly kept out by private guards. A House Jorasco enclave is found here as well as a number of wizard's shops but the most striking feature is Delera's Watch. This stately necropolis is named after one of the founders of Stormreach who is buried here and over the centuries the land has become a rambling collection of gravesites from citizens of many different nations.

* **Coldwake Pond** (19). 
* **Delera's Watch** (20). Crypts and catacombs are hidden throughout Stormreach, but most of the ruined city’s notables are buried in the area of Delera’s Watch, named for one of the first Storm Lords. Aside from the tomb of Delera Omaren, this neighborhood includes the crypts of a number of famous smugglers of old Stormreach, Naturally, tales abound of how these legendary pirates were buried with treasure maps, powerful magic items. or journals detailing the location of sunken merchant ships. Even on their deathbeds. the pirate captains were suspicious and paranoid, and their crypts remain guarded by traps, magical wards, and (it is whispered) undead guardians. Stories abound of a subterranean necropolis of the giants beneath Stormreach. where mummified corpses have lain undisturbed for more than forty thousand years. Whether these tales hold any truth remains to be seen, for any entrance to these catacombs is well hidden.
* **Garden of Respite** (21). 
* **House Jorasco Enclave** (22). House Jorasco’s Healers Guild maintains what is essentially an urban hospital a short distance from the harbor. Jorasco adepts provide healing at the standard rates. Alhaura d'Jorasco (LN female halfling cleric) is the highest-level spelleaster in the enclave. In addition to Alhaura’s ability to cast raise dead. the house possesses an altar of resurrection for use on behalf of favored clients. However, strange events sometimes accompany the use of powerful necromancy in Stormreach, in a handful of cases, foreign spirits have seized the bodies of those being raised. When Jorasco sought to resurrect the Storm Lord Delera Omaren, the risen warrior cried out in the tongue of the giants and killed dozens with lightning before she was returned to the grave. Another time, a pack of marut inevitables appeared after a Wayfinder was raised. The outsiders slew the adventurer and devastated the enclave before vanishing. Today, Jorasco healers use augury before performing major necromancy. Divinations can fail, though. and at the DM’s discretion, resurrection in Stormreach might bring surprises. The local baron is Iriakan d'Jorasco (NG male halfling barbarian), who is trying to improve the house’s standing in Stormreach by making the enclave more and more indispensable.

#### Temple District

Next to Forgelight, the Temple District houses a massive temple-fortress to the Silver Flame, built as a missionary church to savage Xen'drik. The street known as Temple Row contains a melange of other shrines and street preachers who call out prayers to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, and even the Dragon Below to passersby. The other side of the district is the entertainment and vice found in the brothels and taverns of the Temple District. House Phiarlan is just one of many places where those looking for sinful entertainment can be satisfied.

* **House Phiarlan Enclave** (32). 
* **Keep of the Silver Flame** (33). 
* **Livewood Theater** (34). 
* **The Onyx Fountain** (35). 
* **Temple Row** (36). 

#### Silverwall District

Near the eastern beach, Silverwall is dominated by the interests of House Kundarak who petitioned the Storm Lords for land to build here. Their enclave is a ward unto itself called Coasthold where magical research and secret plans are undertaken. The rest of the district falls within Locksmith Square which is a hub of trading and entertainment in Stormreach. Craft shops can be found in the square as well as the strangely beautiful Eldred's Pool which depicts thri-kreen figures either dancing or fighting. The Red Ring, a gladiatorial arena and gambling venue, is also located here for those who seek more bloody entertainment than is found in the rest of the ward, though powerful rivals may be forcing the Ring out of business.

* **The Black Wrack** (23). food, shelter.
* **Citadel of the Twelve** (24). All the dragonmarked houses have an interest in the magical secrets hidden in Xen'drik. This outpost of the Twelve is located on the edge of the city. In addition to serving as a resource for explorers, the citadel is the best place to seek magic items and spellcasting services. Visitors can purchase arcane spells of 5th level or lower, as well as magic items with a 20,000 gp purchase limit. Services and goods are always top quality, but this comes at a cost: prices for spelleasting and magic items are priced 5% above normal. This premium is waived for high-ranking members of a dragonmarked house (including dragonmark heirs) or for PCs in the active service of a house.
* **House Kundarak Enclave** (25). 
* **House Lyrandar Shipyard** (26). 
* **The Red Ring** (27). The civilized nations of Khorvaire might frown on blood sport, but the Storm Lords have no such scruples. An astonishing array of events occurs in this arena of crimson stone, as gladiators do battle with savage giants, fantastic beasts, and each other. Not every battle is fought to the death, but in combat with the creatures of Xen'drik, anything can happen. Adventurers can try to make their fortunes in the Red Ring or by gambling on the outcome of matches. Alternatively, they could be hired to capture beasts to fight in the ring, or they might be drawn into corruption that threatens the life of a friend.
* **Tower of Kol Korran** (28). 
* **Locksmith Square**. 

#### Southwatch District

On the exposed southern edge of the city, Southwatch keeps much to itself and looks after its own. The Karrnathi-dominated Grindstone Ward houses a Temple of Vol, locally called Rosewood, and a Karrnathi militia, while Summerfield is a more cosmopolitan ward with residents from many places. Across the Koronoo, the Tents of Rushemé is a tent city where giants come to trade goods from the Xen'drik jungles including herbs, exotic resources, and even some ancient relics. Anthropologists from the Five Nations sometimes come to speak with the giants but many in Stormreach are nervous that they remain so close.

* **The Black Freighter** (29). 
* **The Ship's Cat** (30). Densewood twigs have been thatched together to create a building that looks like a pile of sticks but has all the strength of stone. The Ship's Cat is an inn run by a shifter named Harysh (NG female shifter ranger), and while the neighborhood is questionable, Harysh has a reputation for fair dealing and discretion. The inn takes its name from Harysh’s dozen cats, which share the place with guests. Familiars and animal companions receive excellent care at the Ship's Cat, and as long as they leave the resident cats alone, they are always welcome in the inn.
* **Temple of Vol** (31). 
* **Circle of Visions**. Shattered statues and monoliths are spread throughout Stormreach, their symbolic meaning lost on contemporary viewers. Among the strangest of the giant ruins are the twelve rings of standing stones scattered about the fringes of Stormreach. Their function and operations is unknown, although each radiates an aura of faint illusion magic. About once a month, a programmed image appears at night in the center of one of the circles. Sometimes the image is a simple one. Other times, the images are more disturbing - a menacing quori or a sinister ziggurat deep within the jungle. So far, no one has been able to determine the pattern or purpose of the mysterious images.
* **The Tents of Rushemé**. Named for one of the first giants to peacefully deal with the Stormreach pirates, the Tents of Rushemé are home to a shifting assortment of nomadic giants who come to trade with the settlers of the modern city. The giants are generally peaceful, and their tents are outside the city grounds, so the Stormreach Guard does not interfere in anything that transpires there. While it is imperative to keep a civil tongue while in Rushemé, those willing to deal with the giants can acquire inexpensive trade goods, strange relics, and useful information.

#### Oldgate District

In the Age of Giants, this district housed the city's main inland gate. Today, the district looks to be in good repair in comparison to the rest of the city, and is considered a model district by the Storm Lords. However, under its respectable face, the district contains intrigues between its militias - the Knights of Thrane and the Ninth Wands - and other power groups in the city.

The Embers Ward is the center of the Thranish presence in Stormreach. Its residents mostly keep to themselves, united by their faith and a desire to make their home a refuge from the wildness in so much of the city. If anyone tries to cause trouble in the ward, the Knights of Thrane, led by Valen Vanatar, do not stand for it.

The Whitewash Ward is home to Aundairian expatriates, who have a reputation for aloofness and one-upmanship. Over the centuries a considerable amount of magic has been woven into their ward: there are more everbright lanterns here than anywhere else in the city, a team of magewrights use prestidigitatioin to keep the district clean, and the district takes its name from a central fountain that allows anyone to instantly clean clothes there. The Aundairians are largely peaceful, but if pressed, they will not hesitate to call on Jorian Thiel and the Ninth Wands.

* **Surrinek Riverboats**. Surrinek has a near monopoly on the river taxi business. Captains may work nearly autonomously, as long as they divide the available customers equitably. Boats range from gondolas to barges. She runs her business from a stilted hut over the river.
* **The Candlelight**. The Thrane-dominated Embers ward is short on places to drink, but has plenty of places to eat. The Candlelight is one of the best, specializing in Thrane deserts. Private rooms are available for a fee.
