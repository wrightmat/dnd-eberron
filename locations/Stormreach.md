Stormreach is a small frontier city nestled on the eastern coast of the Skyfall Peninsula in Xen'drik. Despite its small population, Stormreach is an important city because of its location, allowing easy docking access to travelers wishing to enter Xen'drik. The city also acts as a center for trade and commerce for all who visit the lost continent of Xen'drik. Stormreach is known by some as the "City of Dungeons" because it was built atop an ancient city from the long-lost civilization of giants.

The Stormreach Compact was an agreement made between the Kingdom of Galifar and a collection of pirate leaders called the Storm Lords in 800 YK. The compact gave legal authority over the city of Stormreach to the Storm Lords. It also established the powers each Storm Lord would have based on their family line. As a minor note, the compact also codified several statutes that applied to everyone in city.

### Characters

* **Jonas Wylkes** (CN male half-elf sorcerer). Harbor Lord, and a young noble more interested in enjoying his wealth than maintaining a tight leash on the affairs of the harbor wards.
* **Varen Lassite** (LN male human rogue). Coin Lord, and a brilliant administrator wanted for murder in Sharn.
* **Yorrick Amanatu** (LE male dwarf sorcerer). Coin Lord, and rakshasha agent of the Lords of Dust.

* **Little Del** (NE female halfling wererat wizard). Uses her illusionist spells to hide the Bilge Rat's gang activities.
* **Ereg** (NE male human ranger). A retired hunter, Ereg has tracked many of the strange creatures of Xen'drik ‚Äî the wilder the better. On one of his forays into the jungle, the hunter uncovered a book describing the foundations of the necromantic tradition that has since evolved into the Blood of Vol. Ereg is fascinated by the book and spends his days studying its tattered pages.
* **Gaulronak** (N male hill giant druid). The oldest inhabitant of the Tents of Rusheme√©, Gaulronak is a wizened, elderly giant who scours the nearby jungle for rare herbs and fruit. He sells his gleanings to herbalists and cooks from a tent near the city gates, and he also serves as the primary liaison between the Storm Lords and the giants of Rushem√©. Gaulronak has come to understand the people of Stormreach, and the giants respect his age and wisdom.
* **Hassalac Chaar** (N male kobold sorcerer). This self-styled "Prince of Dragons‚Äù might well be the most powerful spellcaster in Stormreach, but his reclusive nature makes it impossible to know for certain. Hassalae Chaar is a kobold who lives in a hidden complex deep beneath the city. The precise location of his lair is a mystery, since the only known entrance is an extradimensional portal that the kobold controls. Hassalac is fascinated with dragons and has amassed a vast assortment of maps, magic items, and even artifacts dating back beyond the dragon-giant conflict to the dragons‚Äô war against the fiends. Hassalac‚Äôs vaults might contain wealth beyond measure, but they are also filled with deadly traps and lizardfolk guards. Hassalac jealously guards his hoard and rarely leaves his lair, but he sometimes employs adventurers to retrieve relics from the interior of Xen'drik.

### Locations

#### Harbor District

The Harbor is the southwestern district of the city of Stormreach in Xen'drik, containing the docks and waterfront businesses.

The ancient ruins upon which the city of Stormreach are built extend well beneath the water line of the harbor, forming an area known as the Underharbor. These dank, dark, damp, and often water-filled ruins are home to numerous sahuagin, pirates, thieves, murderers, and other creatures of the depths. The Stormreach Guard and the dragonmarked houses like to keep a close watch on the entrances to the Underharbor.

* **The Emperor** (4).
* **Harbormaster's House** (5). Where Jonas Wylkes resides.
* **The Leaky Dinghy** (6). A totally reputable boat rental place that definitely has boats that float.
* **The Lighthouse** (7).
* **Shargon's Talon** (8). 
* **The Waterworks** (9). 
* **Wavecrest Tavern** (10). A seedy half-underwater bar that tailors to sahuagin and other less-than-reputables.

#### Marketplace District

The large central district of the port of Stormreach in Xen'drik. The district contains a large market and many shops, as befits its name. The Marketplace district is governed by the Lassites, a Storm Lord family. It lies adjacent to the Cross district and Dannel's Pride.

* **The Bazaar** (11). 
	* **The Pestle**. alchemical supplies
	* **Far Davandi**. clothing
	* **Tooth and Nail**. exotic beasts
	* **Big Bronau's Boat**. entertainment
	* **Shadows**. entertainment
	* **Forgotten Places**. expedition gear
	* **Havulak Prospecting**. expedition gear
	* **The Thrifty Traveler**. expedition gear
	* **House Tharashk Enclave**. inquisitives
	* **Stormreach Forge**. weapons, armor
* **Black Iron** (12). Primarily a smithy, Black Iron also deals in a variety of goods designed for Large and Huge creatures. It is a center for trade with the giants living in the outlying tent city of Rushem√©, and it provides adventurers with a place to unload treasures of unusual size found in the ruins of Xen'drik. A family of half-giants runs Black Iron. The venerable patriarch Hular (N male half-giant magewright) is a master smith, but age is taking its toll on him. His youngest daughter Solarea (CG female half-giant fighter) has the spirit of an adventurer. She might seek to join parties investigating the ruins of the giants or strike out on her own in a quest to steal a husband from the half-giants of Dar Qat.
* **The Chapterhouse** (13). A joint venture of House Phiarlan and House Ghallanda, this squat structure serves as tavern, hostel, and performance space. It provides inexpensive accommodations and some of the best entertainment the city has to offer. Of course. information can also be bought and sold at the Chapterhouse. The hostel almost always has rooms available at a decent price, the only drawback being that if you're staying at the Chapterhouse, you can be certain someone knows exactly what you're up to.
* **The Falconer‚Äôs Spire** (14). An airship docking tower in the eastern area of the district.
* **Lorsmarch Palace** (15). 
* **Molou's Distillery** (16). A smelly distillery with cracked cisterns and patchwork metal tanks. Molou's makes kuryeva, a potent gin made from the berries of Xen'drik's kuryeva bush. Kuryeva is popular both in the coastal cities of southern Khorvaire and with sailors at sea. Molou's has a taproom where drinkers can have their kuryeva straight from the tanks. Only those with debilitating cravings for the drink spend much time here, though: the sickly-sweet odor of the fermenting liquor drives most patrons away. Molou's regulars include a number of failed prospectorsand adventurers, many of whom saw things in the jungle that only kuryeva can help them forget.
* **Stormreach Recruiters** (17). Characters handy with a sword and willing to follow the Storm Lords‚Äô orders without question can easily find a place in the Stormreach Guard. The pay is 3 sp per day (6 sp for officers), but many guards supplement their income through graft and bribery. Anyone who joins the Guard and completes the three-month training camp has all past crimes wiped away: most change their names to reflect this new beginning. The Storm Lords have extradited criminals before, but they stand by the Stormreach Guard, As long as members of the Guard serve the Lords faithfully, they can leave their pasts behind.
* **Von Ruthvek's Splendors of the South** (18). Valexa Von Ruthvek (N female gnome wizard) is one of Stormreach‚Äôs best-known antiquities dealers, able to identify even the most puzzling items uncovered among the giant ruins. She keeps a wide array of magic items and other curiosities in her store, all under lock, bar, and magical ward to deter thieves. Von Ruthvek offers magic item identification services for the usual rates, but she often pays PCs for a full expedition report if she is interested in finding out more about a particular relic the party has found.

#### Forgelight District

* **The Foundry** (1).
* **House Deneith Enclave** (2).
* **Temple of the Sovereign Host** (3).

#### Cross District

South of the Marketplace District and north of the Harbor District, this area contains Dannel‚Äôs Pride, Stormhaven, and The Sloths.

* **Dannel's Pride**. Known locally as Little Cyre, Dannel's Pride is a ward in the Cross district of Stormreach. Inhabited by its refugees, it is a small survivor of the lost nation of Cyre. A small ward built around a former trading outpost, Dannel's Pride has become heavily populated with Cyran refugees, leading to overcrowding, poverty, and attendant troubles. Maimed veterans of the Last War and hungry children are familiar sights here. Though they have little but broken dreams, the people here endeavor to preserve and rebuild Cyre, right here in Stormreach. They will hotly defend their efforts.
* **Greystone**. 
* **Saltire**. 
* **Stormhaven**. 
* **The Sloths**. 

#### Respite District

Location of the House Jorasco enclave and the Garden of Respite.

* **Coldwake Pond** (19). 
* **Delera's Watch** (20). Crypts and catacombs are hidden throughout Stormreach, but most of the ruined city‚Äôs notables are buried in the area of Delera‚Äôs Watch, named for one of the first Storm Lords. Aside from the tomb of Delera Omaren, this neighborhood includes the crypts of a number of famous smugglers of old Stormreach, Naturally, tales abound of how these legendary pirates were buried with treasure maps, powerful magic items. or journals detailing the location of sunken merchant ships. Even on their deathbeds. the pirate captains were suspicious and paranoid, and their crypts remain guarded by traps, magical wards, and (it is whispered) undead guardians. Stories abound of a subterranean necropolis of the giants beneath Stormreach. where mummified corpses have lain undisturbed for more than forty thousand years. Whether these tales hold any truth remains to be seen, for any entrance to these catacombs is well hidden.
* **Garden of Respite** (21). 
* **House Jorasco Enclave** (22). House Jorasco‚Äôs Healers Guild maintains what is essentially an urban hospital a short distance from the harbor. Jorasco adepts provide healing at the standard rates. Alhaura d'Jorasco (LN female halfling cleric) is the highest-level spelleaster in the enclave. In addition to Alhaura‚Äôs ability to cast raise dead. the house possesses an altar of resurrection for use on behalf of favored clients. However, strange events sometimes accompany the use of powerful necromancy in Stormreach, in a handful of cases, foreign spirits have seized the bodies of those being raised. When Jorasco sought to resurrect the Storm Lord Delera Omaren, the risen warrior cried out in the tongue of the giants and killed dozens with lightning before she was returned to the grave. Another time, a pack of marut inevitables appeared after a Wayfinder was raised. The outsiders slew the adventurer and devastated the enclave before vanishing. Today, Jorasco healers use augury before performing major necromancy. Divinations can fail, though. and at the DM‚Äôs discretion, resurrection in Stormreach might bring surprises. The local baron is Iriakan d'Jorasco (NG male halfling barbarian), who is trying to improve the house‚Äôs standing in Stormreach by making the enclave more and more indispensable.

#### Temple District

The district is dominated by the Keep of the Silver Flame, established a little over a century ago as an outpost for the missionaries the church sends into the depths of Xen'drik (a program that, to date, has met with little success). A host of smaller temples, churches, and shrines are scattered across the district and the city.

* **House Phiarlan Enclave** (32). 
* **Keep of the Silver Flame** (33). 
* **Livewood Theater** (34). 
* **The Onyx Fountain** (35). 
* **Temple Row** (36). 

#### Silverwall District

* **The Black Wrack** (23). food, shelter.
* **Citadel of the Twelve** (24). All the dragonmarked houses have an interest in the magical secrets hidden in Xen'drik. This outpost of the Twelve is located on the edge of the city. In addition to serving as a resource for explorers, the citadel is the best place to seek magic items and spellcasting services. Visitors can purchase arcane spells of 5th level or lower, as well as magic items with a 20,000 gp purchase limit. Services and goods are always top quality, but this comes at a cost: prices for spelleasting and magic items are priced 5% above normal. This premium is waived for high-ranking members of a dragonmarked house (including dragonmark heirs) or for PCs in the active service of a house.
* **House Kundarak Enclave** (25). 
* **House Lyrandar Shipyard** (26). 
* **The Red Ring** (27). The civilized nations of Khorvaire might frown on blood sport, but the Storm Lords have no such scruples. An astonishing array of events occurs in this arena of crimson stone, as gladiators do battle with savage giants, fantastic beasts, and each other. Not every battle is fought to the death, but in combat with the creatures of Xen'drik, anything can happen. Adventurers can try to make their fortunes in the Red Ring or by gambling on the outcome of matches. Alternatively, they could be hired to capture beasts to fight in the ring, or they might be drawn into corruption that threatens the life of a friend.
* **Tower of Kol Korran** (28). 
* **Locksmith Square**. 

#### Southwatch District

* **The Black Freighter** (29). 
* **The Ship's Cat** (30). Densewood twigs have been thatched together to create a building that looks like a pile of sticks but has all the strength of stone. The Ship's Cat is an inn run by a shifter named Harysh (NG female shifter ranger), and while the neighborhood is questionable, Harysh has a reputation for fair dealing and discretion. The inn takes its name from Harysh‚Äôs dozen cats, which share the place with guests. Familiars and animal companions receive excellent care at the Ship's Cat, and as long as they leave the resident cats alone, they are always welcome in the inn.
* **Temple of Vol** (31). 
* **Circle of Visions**. Shattered statues and monoliths are spread throughout Stormreach, their symbolic meaning lost on contemporary viewers. Among the strangest of the giant ruins are the twelve rings of standing stones scattered about the fringes of Stormreach. Their function and operations is unknown, although each radiates an aura of faint illusion magic. About once a month, a programmed image appears at night in the center of one of the circles. Sometimes the image is a simple one. Other times, the images are more disturbing - a menacing quori or a sinister ziggurat deep within the jungle. So far, no one has been able to determine the pattern or purpose of the mysterious images.
* **The Tents of Rushem√©**. Named for one of the first giants to peacefully deal with the Stormreach pirates, the Tents of Rushem√© are home to a shifting assortment of nomadic giants who come to trade with the settlers of the modern city. The giants are generally peaceful, and their tents are outside the city grounds, so the Stormreach Guard does not interfere in anything that transpires there. While it is imperative to keep a civil tongue while in Rushem√©, those willing to deal with the giants can acquire inexpensive trade goods, strange relics, and useful information.
