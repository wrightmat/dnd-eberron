Skairn is a rough-and-tumble yet oddly vibrant pirate town, where the sea meets lawlessness, but where even the most hardened smugglers know the value of community and survival.

### Characters

* **Brugha Deepbrand** (female orc smith). The gruff but warm-hearted owner of The Moonlit Forge. She took a warforged named Shear under her wing when he arrived in Skairn, teaching him how to work metal while helping him adapt to the world.
* **Captain Veylan “Black Tide” Kordann** (male pirate captain). The unofficial ruler of Skairn, Veylan is an aging but cunning pirate who keeps the town in check.
* **Old Toma** (male tortle druid). A retired sailor who claims to have once sailed to the edge of the world. Now he spends his days near the Driftwood Market, telling tales of spirits, manifest zones, and forgotten gods.

### Locations

* **The Driftwood Market**. A constantly shifting collection of stalls and stands built from shipwrecks, offering rare goods from across the seas. Smugglers and honest merchants alike peddle wares, including exotic animals, mysterious relics, and strange artifacts.
* **The Moonlit Forge**. A smithy and workshop run by an older orc named Brugha Deepbrand, famous for her ability to craft armor from salvaged ship parts and enchanted metal.
* **The Broken Compass Tavern**. The heart of Skairn’s social life, this raucous bar is known for its strong rum, sea shanties, and the "Table of Fates," a gambling table where fortunes are won or lost on the roll of enchanted dice.
* **The Forsaken Shrine**. An overgrown stone structure on the town’s edge, dedicated to long-forgotten spirits of the nearby sea and forest. Druids and other tied to nature often finds themselves drawn here, feeling an inexplicable connection to the place.
* **Forsaken Forest**. This wood possesses the Primordial Matter trait of Lamannia (due to a potent manifest zone), and its vegetation is strong and vibrant—and refuses to be conquered by civilization.
