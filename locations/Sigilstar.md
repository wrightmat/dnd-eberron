Sigilstar, called the "crossroads of Thrane", is a small city in Thrane. It is named after Eberron's pole star, because the rest of Thrane is centered on the small city just as the skies of Eberron are centered on that star.

It sits astride the lightning rail line between Aruldusk and Flamekeep, and on the Orien trade road between the southern and northern parts of the nation of Thrane. Its position on the northern bank of the Thrane River allows it access via a waterway to Scion's Sound as well. The city is the primary transfer point for cargo that is switching modes of transport between land, water and rail.

The city is notable, at least among Thranes and architects, for its impressive examples of Flamic architecture. Many of the spires of the city are capped with crystal spires that glow with the captured light of the sun, creating a beautiful nighttime illumination across the city.

Sigilans are more likely than other Thranes to practice the arcane arts and the city is a center of magical study for the nation.

Sigilstar is known for its teas, and Sigilans are known for going to the teahouses that can be found throughout the city, and where patrons can freely discuss anything, even politics and religion in ways that are practically unknown in the rest of Thrane.

### Characters

* **Lahira ir’Vanaisho** (female human). The minister in charge of Sigilstar is Archbishop Lahira ir’Vanaisho, a venerable human administrator who’s governed the city for the past half-century. While she hasn’t announced her retirement yet, junior members of the ministry are intensely politicking for her position — appealing both to influential interest groups within the city as well as directly to Cardinal Kahlia Vanatar who will make the decision.
* **Cardinal Kahlia Vanatar** (non-binary human). The local leader of the Church of the Silver Flame.
* **Nyllestra Tarravan** (female elf). The head of Sigilstar Academy, and a wizened mage of ancient but indeterminate age.

### Locations

* **Sigilstar Academy**. The Arcane Order of Aureon founded the Sigilstar Academy in the years before Daskara was absorbed into the Kingdom of Galifar and became Thrane. Though the order is today primarily an Aundairian institution, it was once headquartered in Sigilstar; the order’s depredations during the Year of Blood and Fire are still a black mark on its history and significantly contributed to the people of Thrane turning away from arcane magic. While the school is still affiliated with the arcane order, it has largely shed its religious trappings and become a primarily secular institution dedicated to arcane education. Today, Sigilstar Academy teaches the future mages of Thrane, offering a rigorous magical education for youth with arcane ability. It’s also home to the Chronepsis Institution, the foremost center for research into divination and astromancy in the Five Nations. The institute’s head, an elf named Nyllestra Tarravan, is a wizened mage of ancient but indeterminate age.
* **Imperial Gallery Of Textiles**. Sigilstar is the fashion capital of Khorvaire. While Cyre once had the manufacturing base for textile production, the greatest designers have long lived in Sigilstar. Before the war, the industry had a clear annual schedule — outfits had to be ready in the spring, as feudal lords got ready to leave their holds and venture out for the summer court season. The best of these designs were accepted into the Imperial Gallery, a formal preservation effort started by monks of Kol Korran who wished to keep a history of the changing styles. Powerful abjurations protect the gallery’s exhibits from the ravages of time. While the exhibits do have a bias towards the styles of the wealthy and powerful — attempts to document the clothing of Khorvaire’s everyday citizens are only just starting — their collection of imperial wear from the courts of Galifar is unrivalled. Collections from beyond Thrane are limited, but the monks of Kol Korran who run it still have some international donors.
* **Grand Gallery Of The Firstborn**. Nominally the House Lyrandar headquarters in Sigilstar, the Grand Gallery of the Firstborn is primarily a museum celebrating Lyran and Selavash. Various documents and objects showcase all the places the legendary duo traveled to, from pieces of their first ship that were recovered from the depths of the Bitter Sea to their family lineages. The museum has a religious bent consistent with the pre-Silver Flame religiosity of Sigilstar, holding that the Mark of Storm was a gift from Arawai and Kol Korran.
* **Church of the Silver Flame**.
* **Star Market**. The small market district where various specialty shops are located.
* **River's Rest Station**. This Orien-run lightning rail stop features multiple layers of shops and restaurants on top of the actual train platforms. These range from cheap options for thrifty travelers to many of the city's finest selections in dining and commerce. While the options for traveling in and out of the city were somewhat limited during the war, the Treaty of Thronehold has revitalized River’s Rest Station by restoring international travel and commerce. The station is well-staffed with Medani inspectors who actively monitor for criminal activity.
	* **Frita's Frites**. A small restaurant run by a halfling named Frita that serves varies types of fried shoestring but potatoes topped with a number of things.
	* **The Whistling Kettle**. Teahouse.
- **Storm's Landing**. While Sigilstar lacks the deep harbor necessary for the full range of seafaring vessels, it is nonetheless an important port of trade for Scions Sound. Despite being the historic home of House Lyrandar, plenty of independent captains call Sigilstar their home port. The river elves especially have a presence here, remaining proudly independent of a house that they feel has gone too corporate.
