 #location #town [[Eldeen Reaches]]

> The quiet town of Delethorn sits nestled on the shores of Lake Galifar. The town’s main road connects the docks and stables in the east of town to the main north-south thoroughfare out of town. At the crossroads sits the Delethorn Town Hall and the office of the mayor, as well as the Delethorn branch of the Gold Dragon Inn. Other smaller shops and houses dot other positions along the roads.

Delethorn is a small town in the central Eldeen Reaches, on the shores of Lake Galifar. House Vadalis has an enclave in the town, and is a major influence. The town is a regular source of commerce with the other nations of Khorvaire. This is the town the party started their adventures in during [[C01. What Dreams May Come]].

### Characters

* **Gelel Embertree** (male human mayor). Gelel is an exuberant young man and fairly new civil servant. He is afraid that the damage the new factory is doing to his town's economy will be the end of his political career, and will do anything to stop it. He speaks relatively quickly, with unnecessary grandeur and/or large words (with a Minnesotan accent).
* **Ditan Indaze** (male human dockmaster). A gruff old man who doesn't have a lot of patience for niceties. He speaks slowly and tersely (like a Canadian lumberjack). Turns out he’s a total dick when speaking to this group, although he kind of respects Bystan for their jokes.
* **Kelyra Ambereyes** (female halfling inkeeper/healer). Runs the Gold Dragon Inn. Speaks with a slight Romanian accent.
* **Boraz d’Tharashk** (male half-orc investigator). A half-orc private investigator, adventurer, and bounty hunter who has claimed the ancient sewers running under the sewers of Delethorn in the name of the Finders Guild. He lives on the edge of town, and mostly keeps to himself. He has a deep, slow, abbreviated voice, with many monosyllabic utterances.
* **Jenseris** (female elf shopkeeper). Runs Delethorn Arms and Armor.
