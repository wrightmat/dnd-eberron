### Universal Properties

Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.

**Enchanted Realm**. Saving throws against illusion or enchantment spells have disadvantage. When a creature casts an illusion or enchantment spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

**Storybook Logic**. No two areas of Thelanis are exactly alike. Each is driven by its story, and any rule can be overridden by a particular tale. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent; in the Valley of Stolen Fire, all fire damage becomes cold damage. Ability checks using particular skills could have advantage or disadvantage. In one area, spells that restore hit points might have no effect; in another, a glass of wine could act as a potion of healing. But while these effects vary from area to area, they are entirely reliable within that area and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story.

**Words Have Power**. In Thelanis, words — and particularly promises — have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise. The price varies, a slightly broken promise to a greater fey might simply result in a run of bad luck, with disadvantage on the next few rolls. On the other hand, a promise to an archfey could inherently carry the power of a geas. The fey themselves are bound by this restriction — though they are aware of it and are exceedingly careful with their promises.

**Chaotic Time**. Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from area to area. It’s possible for adventurers to spend a night in Thelanis, then discover that a year has passed in Eberron. But it’s equally possible for a group of adventurers to find an area where they save a kingdom and reign as kings and queens... only to stumble through a gate many years later and discover that only an hour has passed in their homes. Often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron — either swiftly aging them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades of time spent in Thelanis.

### Characters

* **Esmeray** (female spring eladrin envoy). A member of the Spring Court and Selene’s former (and jilted) lover. She is working as an agent of Destiny to set things right by taking out Celene. While Destiny presumes that ascension would then fall back to the Summer Court, as it should, maybe Esmeray has her own ambitions for elevating the Spring Court instead?

### Locations

##### Palace of the Moon

The grandest city in the Moonlit Vale is the Palace of the Moon. Its towers are built into the trunks of four vast trees, each one reflecting the influence of a particular season. The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer.
