### Characters

* **[[Destiny]]**
* **[[Pax]]** (non-binary autumn eladrin noble). Liege Pax is an Autumn Eladrin with skin the color of fresh fallen leaves and a voice like honey in warm tea. They had a brief tryst with Bystan several years ago.
* **[[Ihan de Rhaan]]** (male summer eladrin noble). Duke Ihan is the stronger member of the Summer Court, at least in the eyes of the broader Court of the Palace of the Moon, and likely would have advanced to Baron if the Summer Court had taken over as scheduled.
* **[[Phoebe de Rhaan]]** (female summer eladrin noble). Phoebe is Ihanâ€™s sister, and the weaker perceived member of the Summer Court.
* **Esmeray** (female spring eladrin envoy). A member of the Spring Court and Seleneâ€™s former (and jilted) lover. She is working as an agent of Destiny to set things right by taking out Celene. While Destiny presumes that ascension would then fall back to the Summer Court, as it should, maybe Esmeray has her own ambitions for elevating the Spring Court instead?
* **Mahsa** (female autumn eladrin noble). Lady Mahsa is a member of the Autumn Court, and Baron Seleneâ€™s current occult advisor. She allied herself with Selene in order to hold on to power and get a position in her court after she ascended to the throne. The Autumn Court previously held the throne at the Palace of the Moon, and Mahsa served as advisor to that Baron as well. Secretly, she also supported Selene because she knew that the Prince of Frost would return to claim a new Queen of Winter, and she wants to see the Palace of the Moon fall. After all, if the Autumn Court can no longer control the Palace, then why should anyone?
* **[[The Forest Queen]]**
* **[[Fortuneâ€™s Fool]]**
* **[[The Forgotten Prince]]**
* **[[The Mother of Invention]]**
* **[[The Lady in Shadow]]**

### Locations

#### The Moonlit Vale
The Moonlit Vale is essentially a country, with the feyspires spread across it as cities; itâ€™s possible to spend days traveling from spire to spire. While itâ€™s largely arboreal, there are beautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. Itâ€™s always night here, and the moon Rhaan radiates bright light, always seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon doesnâ€™t move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court is covered in snow, while in spring, itâ€™s in brilliant flower. This has nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to do with the intrigues of the Palace of the Moon; the current season indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant. This is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: things change. The baronies are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the four seasons are the story Thelanis tells itself.

The Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the fey â€” otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of illusion â€” streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The beasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual colors and patterns; while many use standard stat blocks, sentient beasts might use the statistics for Valenar beasts. The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have advantage on foraging checks... though hunting without permission may incur the wrath of the local fey.

The feyspires are the cities of the Moonlit Vale. Each is home to a single archfey whose personal story is reflected by the spire, along with a few greater fey and a host of eladrin and other mortals. The grandest city in the Moonlit Vale is the Palace of the Moon.

##### Palace of the Moon
The grandest city in the Moonlit Vale is the Palace of the Moon. Its towers are built into the trunks of four vast trees, each one reflecting the influence of a particular season. The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer.

##### Pylas Pyrial
Pylas Pyrial is the Gate of Joy, celebrated for its bards and revels. Tied to Zilargo, it has a significant gnome population. It's allied with the summer fey of the Moon Court, and is ruled over by an archfey known as Shan Pyrial.

>You come upon a glittering tower of alabaster and gold, where a large sun hangs in the sky and warms the surrounding lands. Gnomes and Summer Eladrin mingle casually, and the sounds of music and poetry fill the streets.

##### Shae Joridal
Shae Joridal is the City of Emerald Lights; its illusionists are legendary. It appears in what is now Darguun. It's allied with the autumn fey of the Moon Court, and is ruled over by an archfey known as Shan Jora (or the Grim Poet).

>You come upon a grand emerald spire, impressively tall, and surrounded at the top by three orbiting spheres that glow with emerald light. Goblinoids and Autumn Eladrin roam the streets in what appears to be an uneasy peace at best.

##### Shae Loralyndar
Shae Loralyndar is the City of Rose and Thorn, an arboreal spire frequently found in the Twilight Demesne of the Eldeen Reaches. Many Greensingers have close ties to this city. It's allied with the spring fey of the Moon Court, and it's ruled over by an archfey known as Shan Lora.

>You come upon an arboreal spire within a dense forest, where peak-roofed houses are connected by slender bridges, with beautiful rose gardens spreading between them. Autumn Eladrin and humanoid druids can be seen working together here.

##### Shae Tirias Tolai
Shae Tirias Tolai is the City of Silver and Bone. Tied to Xenâ€™drik, it was sacked by the giants of the Culâ€™sir Dominion and never reclaimed; some believe the elves of Eberron are descended from the eladrin of Shae Tirias Tolai. Today, itâ€™s a haunted ruin, shunned by the fey.

>You come upon a gothic citadel that blends beauty and luxury with morbid reminders of death. The spire itself and city around it were built using bones as its base, blended with marble and silver, and with pools of fresh blood in place of fountains. Glamerweave tapestries display the tales of forgotten heroes, but the cloth is torn and tattered. The sounds of battle can still be heard as echoes, as there's no one else here to make other sounds.

##### Shaelas Tiraleth
Shaelas Tiraleth is the Court of the Silver Tree, largest of the feyspires. Its ruler, Shan Tira (or the Lady of the Silver Tree), is a master diviner and gifted oracle. All archfey respect her words, and she serves as a mediator between the seasons of the Moon Court. The spire is tied to Cyre, and there are stories that suggest the first Princess Cyre herself may have been a student of Shan Tira.

>You come upon a golden geometric spire, more opulent and ornate than any other structure on the moon, with a huge silver tree in front of it. Humans and elves wearing brightly-colored glamerweave clothing wander peacefully through the streets. There's music in the air and lights in the sky.

##### Taer Syraen
Taer Syraen is the Winter Citadel, seat of the Prince of Frost. This martial spire appears in a barren region of Karrnath. Itâ€™s closely allied with the winter fey of the Moon Court.

>You come upon slender towers of blue-white stone with delicate minarets sparkling in the light. Fragile bridges span the gaps between, giving the place the appearance of a crystalline web formed from ice. A steep ice wall surrounds the spire, protected by helmeted guards, their faces hidden behind grim visors, watching for enemies and intruders alike.

#### The Endless Weald
The Forest Queen rules the Endless Weald within Thelanis, an arboreal realm inhabited by dire beasts and wild fey. The Weald often leaks into the wood through manifest zones found in deep forests; in such places, dryads lurk in the trees and beasts may possess unusual cunning.

#### Folly
Folly is the barony of Fortuneâ€™s Fool. Here, great misfortunes regularly occur, but invariably lead to unlikely success. In this layer, d20 rolls of 5 or below are always considered a 1, and rolls of 16 or above are always considered a 20. Folly contains a charming village and a number of threats â€” a dragon, a giant â€” that canâ€™t be defeated with weapons alone. However, skill checks can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it may take time for the adventurers to discover this.

#### Castle of Forgotten Things
Barony of The Forgotten Prince.

#### The Assembly
Barony of the The Mother of Invention, also known as the Forge Maiden. Here, innovation is celebrated, and any artificer spell cast in this layer is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. But while there are a few stories of how things go well, there are many where inventions go terribly wrong: the construct dragon that has claimed the workshop and gathered a hoard; the labyrinth the Maiden designed so well that she became lost in it; the time stop spell that canâ€™t be undone. Wondrous (and impossible) artifacts can be found here, but so can many dangers.

#### The Shadow
Barony of The Lady in Shadow. The secret garden of the Lady is walled and protected by dangerous plant creatures, but holds imaginary flowers that an alchemist could use to do amazing things. The Ladyâ€™s tower is hidden within a maze of thorns, which also leads to the Garden of Forking Ways (as all mazes on Rhaan do).

#### Fields of Fable
Barony of The Harvest Monarch. The Harvest Monarch is tied to the land they govern. When their people suffer, theyâ€™re sickly. In prosperous times, theyâ€™re strong and vital. Sometimes theyâ€™re deposed and forced to walk their land in hiding; during these times, theyâ€™re known as the Long Wanderer or the Exile. But theyâ€™re the rightful ruler and are always restored, and those who aid them are rewarded.

#### Garden of Forking Ways
The Garden of Forking Ways is Destiny's realm. He continually walks its maze-like paths, his Book forever chained to his wrist. The garden has many forking paths, and it can be entered through any maze or labyrinth. Another prominent feature of the garden is a set of giant statues of the Endless, which change to reflect their prototypes' current state.

Destiny's residence is within the garden, and the Endless will meet there when they converge as a family, almost without exception. His Gallery is a stone hallway with painted portraits of the Endless on the wall.

### Universal Properties

Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.

**Enchanted Realm**. Saving throws against illusion or enchantment spells have disadvantage. When a creature casts an illusion or enchantment spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

**Storybook Logic**. No two areas of Thelanis are exactly alike. Each is driven by its story, and any rule can be overridden by a particular tale. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent; in the Valley of Stolen Fire, all fire damage becomes cold damage. Ability checks using particular skills could have advantage or disadvantage. In one area, spells that restore hit points might have no effect; in another, a glass of wine could act as a potion of healing. But while these effects vary from area to area, they are entirely reliable within that area and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story.

**Words Have Power**. In Thelanis, words â€” and particularly promises â€” have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise. The price varies, a slightly broken promise to a greater fey might simply result in a run of bad luck, with disadvantage on the next few rolls. On the other hand, a promise to an archfey could inherently carry the power of a geas. The fey themselves are bound by this restriction â€” though they are aware of it and are exceedingly careful with their promises.

**Chaotic Time**. Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from area to area. Itâ€™s possible for adventurers to spend a night in Thelanis, then discover that a year has passed in Eberron. But itâ€™s equally possible for a group of adventurers to find an area where they save a kingdom and reign as kings and queens... only to stumble through a gate many years later and discover that only an hour has passed in their homes. Often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron â€” either swiftly aging them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades of time spent in Thelanis.
