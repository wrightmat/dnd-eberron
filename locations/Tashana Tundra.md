The Tashana Tundra is a land of vast, open spaces and endless sky. Home to the great shifter nation of Sarlona, the Tundra consists mainly of grassy, treeless plains that stretch without interruption from horizon to horizon. For many thousands of years, these semi-nomadic tribes have roamed the grasslands, isolated from the rest of the world and left in relative peace to contemplate the cold, pure spirit of their ancestral homeland.

### At A Glance

* National Motto: "Banded we live!"
* Planar Elements: The southern border of the Tashana region is marked by a gradual elevation shift and what appears to be an intermittent manifest zone tied to Risia, the Plane of Ice. All along these border lands, planar manifestations of ice and snow have given the appearance of a land of perpetual winter to those south of the border. This geographical isolation has resulted in a land that is remarkably insular and self-sustaining. The Tundra is well known for reality storms (aukaraks in the ancient Shifter dialect), rogue planar breaches and manifest zones that drift over the landscape.

### Land of Many Waters

Tashana means "many waters" in an ancient, nearly extinct shifter dialect. The plains are dotted with hundreds, if not thousands, of small glacial lakes. Many of these remain frozen year-round, but the southern waters thaw in summer. In these months, the Tundra is a place of pure and unspoiled natural beauty. The landscapes are regularly interrupted by huge mounds of rocks and boulders, some miles wide, that seem to have fallen from the sky. Remnants, presumably, of an earlier glacial age, these rock mounds have a strange and otherworldly beauty.

The majority of the Tundra is covered with frosty grasslands. To the north the Eska Mountains rise, and the northern foothills of the Paqaa Mountains encroach upon the southern border. In the far north, the dream-like and ghostly Tashyvar Islands reach into the Sea of Rage. Finally, the mysterious Krertok Peninsula extends northeast of the Eska Spines.

The climate is mainly subarctic, with true arctic conditions in the northern plains and mountains, and short summer months of near-temperate conditions in the south. If anything definitive can be said of the Tundra as a whole, it is this — it is a land of strange weather. Blizzards, snow squalls, and whiteouts sometimes descend in an instant, but also common are strange heat waves, downpours of inexplicably warm rain, and savage lightning strikes.

### Religion and Culture

Eschewing technological and industrial advancements, the majority of Tashana shifters choose instead a path of simplicity and union with their natural surroundings. Although much of this choice is strictly a practical matter, it is also a defining spiritual aspect of the shifters of Tashana. Where a foreigner might see the Tundra way of life as primitive, the native sees it as pure and spiritually powerful.

The central nations of the Qiku and the Saartuk have enjoyed relative peace for many generations, and as their communities continue to grow and prosper, the shifter mind has turned inward to more spiritual matters. They are no longer driven by a struggle to survive, and now their shamanistic traditions grow more advanced with every generation. This advancement is evidenced by the shifters' sophisticated use of medicinal and magical
lichens native to the Tundra.

Of the peoples of the Tashana Tundra region, only the shifters of the Qiku and Saartuk tribes have developed a cohesive culture that can be effectively chronicled. The dwarves of the Dorann Holds have isolated themselves for generations, and only the occasional artifact finds its
way out of the Eska mountain passes. The culture of the Dokiak clans has been all but destroyed by the genocidal machinations of the Inspired.

### Art and Architecture

Currently in vogue among a small circle of influential collectors in Khorvaire (Zilargo in particular), Tashanan art is surprisingly sophisticated and powerful for such a "primitive" culture. "An unmatched sophistication of simplicity," says Morgrave art scholar Mentarion Palinostrum.

Most prized are animal sculptures made of ivory, whalebone, antler, and stone, often found as ornamental parts of utilitarian objects. These figurines reveal a highly developed aesthetic style, with a meticulous exactness of anatomy and proportion. Tashanan paintings employ natural oils and pigments with hide canvases, and display complex techniques that are the envy of many a Khorvairian art student. The popular dreamscape style features dense and surreal landscapes of the natural world with an overlay of strange shapes, colors and images.

Virtually all Tashana shifters were at least semi-nomadic until only a few generations ago. Now, many tribes of the Qiku and Saartuk nations have established permanent settlements and a nascent architectural tradition. In the central plains, sprawling villages built in and among the strange rock mounds combine stonework and tunneling with traditional shelters of seal or caribou skins. This dreamscape style features odd, otherworldly totems and ornamentations. In the coastal settlements of Winterstead and Whitetooth, increased trade has resulted in a riot of improvised architectural styles.

The nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes still employ collapsible tents of seal or caribou skins, supported by frames of bone and driftwood. Larger structures typically have raised sleeping platforms and a simple flue to release smoke. It's thought that the Chuniigi tribes of
the far north maintain several hidden ice fortresses and storehouses carved directly into glacial formations.

### Food and Fashion

The Tundra is not the place for cultured cuisine, but in terms of resourcefulness and ingenuity, Tashanans must be admired. In coastal and lake areas, the diet consists primarily of fish, waterfowl, and sea mammals, with some varieties of harvested seaweed. Inland, meat is provided
by the vast herds of caribou, supplemented by fox, bear, and the occasional mammoth in the far north. Many tribes also harvest various types of lichen and algae that cling to the glacial rocks of the plains. Tashanans are renowned for finding utility in every possible part of the kill — examples are foxsnout soup and the infamous Chuniigi blubbercake. Some larger southern tribes employ a limited system of agriculture for winter grains.

Materials and clothing among the Tashanans are almost entirely animal-based. Males and females both are likely to wear trousers and parkas of polar bear hide, with great fur-lined hoods. Boots are made of caribou or seal skin. Dressing in layers is the rule, since the weather of the Tundra is famously unpredictable. The hareskin socks and gloves of the Tashana are greatly prized for their warmth and comfort. Clothing is typically stitched with narwhal or caribou sinew.

### Getting There

Although no more difficult to travel to than other locales, the Tashana Tundra had few visitors in the past. The austere beauty of the place and its peoples drew little interest. Recently, however, things have changed.

Intercontinental trade on a significant scale has developed on the western Tashana coastline. Exports of medicinal and magical lichens from the Tashanan interior have resulted in expansion of the port communities of Winterstead and Whitetooth, at the respective openings of the Qonama and Tiiki rivers. Although the Tundra does produce some unique herbs and spices, the true reason for this rapid growth is less savory — coastal Tashana produces a particularly potent strain of the fatigue-alleviating lichen known as muqqa, or icewild. Also, Tashana shifter art is currently in vogue among a few wealthy collectors in Zilargo. As a result, there's a great demand for brave souls willing to discover and barter for genuine artworks.

Recent years have also seen a significant influx of shifters from Khorvaire — both individual pilgrims and entire communities. Khorvarian shifters have been arriving by boat in greater numbers since the end of the Last War, with charismatic leaders often at the head of entire naval convoys of pilgrims. Individual shifters might want to travel to Tashana for personal or spiritual reasons; other characters might sign on as escorts and
defenders of the larger shifter migrations.

And as with any place, not all visitors arrive by choice. The Dokiak people maintain their community-in-exile in the northern foothills of the Paqaa Mountains. Internal travel is not difficult despite the lack of good roads. Shifter and dwarf communities have long traded among themselves, and limited trade exists between the shifters and the northern border communities of Sarlona.

### A Day in the Life

Tel-Marq wakes as the morning light shines through the small opening of his sealskin tent. Exiting into the bright glare of snow and sky, he squints to survey the horizon. Subtle indications of wind, light, and scent tell him that a storm is coming. It will be white snow, dry and cold. And much of it, indeed.

After feeding himself and his team of sled dogs, Tel-Marq gathers his gear. About 200 yards away, a hole is cut into the ice of the frozen lake upon which the camp is set. The dogs guard the equipment and the meat gleaned from the hunt so far. They and the sad bundle — the remains of
his hunting companion, Tel-Ruq.

No time to dwell on such things, Tel-Marq tells himself as he sits next to the hole in the ice. It is only a matter of time, he knows, before a seal or walrus spots the hole from below and takes the opportunity for a breath of fresh air. Then Tel-Marq's spear will fly, and another kill will be added to the take for this hunt. Tel-Marq braces himself against the cold and begins what could be a long wait. He lets his eyes gaze off to the horizon and feels the calm and patient spirit of the land flow through him. Ice and sky. Wind and snow. Emptiness and endlessness...

Tel-Marq reacts in an instant as the water before him erupts, his spear flying straight and true as an old walr us breaches the surface. Tel-Marq secures the carcass with the others. It is enough; the hunt is finished. He lets his eyes fall again on the bundle of Tel- Ruq's remains frozen among the carcasses. Tel-Marq had found him the previous day, by one of the more distant hunting holes, felled by wolves. Tel-Marq had driven off the lone, wounded creature that remained, then gathered up his friend and brother to return him home to the tribe.

The dogs bristle with anticipation as Tel-Marq mounts the sled. Looking again to the horizon, he squints into the glare. Could it be? Yes, there. A hundred yards away, the spectral wolf regards Tel-Marq with utter calm. A sense of peace washes over Tel-Marq as he acknowledges the presence of the spirit animal. It is a benediction of sorts, a sign from the animal spirits that the hunt has been well and proper.

Tel-Marq drives the dogs hard through the afternoon, hoping to return to the village before nightfall. The predicted snowstorm arrives. There is little wind, but the large, dry flakes drift gently to the ground as if an entire ocean of snow were falling to earth. Navigating by instinct alone, Tel-Marq rides though the blinding white.

The snow begins to taper off slightly when Tel-Marq rounds a large rock mound and catches a scent in the air that makes his blood freeze. He halts the dogs, calming and quieting them with a series of hand signals. Convinced that he is safely upwind, Tel-Marq clambers up the glacial rock pile and peers down the other side.

Two figures clad in fur and skins — shifter skins, Tel-Marq notes with fury — are fighting over the scraps of a fox carcass. Sharpened bones pierce the barbarians' skin in multiple places, entire strips of flesh deliberately pulled and torn. The faces are a ruin of scars and dead or dying flesh. They are Kalaak. Scouts, Tel-Marq thinks, and there were likely more, hidden by the swirling white. The wind and snow meant neither Tel-Marq nor the raiders would likely be able to follow a trail. Slowly, Tel-Marq nocks an arrow in his massive bow. They would not be able to scale the rocks before he felled them both. And they would not flee. Kalaak never fled.

Tel-Marq gathers the cruel metal morningstars from the arrow-riddled bodies. Best to return to the village and warn the elders. Kalaak! This far south! A bad omen, indeed. Time to move the village again.

That evening, the tribal drummers whirl in a frenzy of celebration as other hunting parties return. Around the fire in the large black sealskin tent of the elders, Tel-Mar1 makes his report — the death of Tel-Ruq and the appearance of the Kalaak raiders. Having done his duty by his tribe and his family, Tel-Marq sets off for his own lodging. Time now for sleep.
