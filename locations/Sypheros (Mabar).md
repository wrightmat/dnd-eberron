### Locations

#### The Drifting Citadel
This floating tower was once a library; a former part of Syrania. Now it drifts through an icy void, grand windows shattered and books fallen from their shelves. Shadows of sages clutch at books with insubstantial fingers, never able to turn a page. The angelic librarians are now tormented spirits who hunger for knowledge, draining the memories from any creature unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp.

This is the home of Despair, where she observes sorrow through her various mirrors. People who see or speak with her can't help but feel gloomy, as she is the personification of pain, doubt and dread.

#### Amaranthine City
If the Endless Night has a heart, it would be the Amaranthine Cityâ€¦ a metropolis that fills an entire layer, and is the antithesis of the city of the same name in Irian. Nothing flourishes in this plane; banners are tattered and gardens are withered. But it is still wondrous in the scope of its cyclopean towers and grand fortifications. It is the capital of an empire in decline, and yet the hint of what it was at the height of its glory makes it wondrous even when faded. And it is no empty shell; it is a city alive with activity. This is the domain of the Empress of Shadows.

##### Abandoned Sanitarium
This sanitarium is filled with crazed Canoloths who are trapped here (or at least think they are) and starving. It serves as the analog to Club Starlight on Irian.

##### Den of Despair
This is a drug den that's run by an Ultroloth named Opiamuth. He sells a powerful narcotic which he creates that he named "opiam". Creatures from all over the plane flock here to slip into a deep sleep and forget their worries. It serves as the analog to Desire's Den on Irian (although Despair herself never comes here and just watches from her citadel).

##### The Barghest Bin
This is an outdoor pen full of barghests, and serves as the analog to Rhea's Ranch on Irian.

#### The Kingdom of Bones
Where the domain of the Amaranthine City feels like an empire in its last days, the Kingdom of Bones is one thatâ€™s already fallen. If a layer contains a fortress, itâ€™s not preparing for a final battle; itâ€™s what remained after the battle. The gates are shattered, and bloodstains and broken weapons are scattered across the floors. The people of this domain fought a dreadful war and lost... but this being Mabar, their bones remain. The skeletons of peasants continue their menial labors, seemingly oblivious to the futility of their actions. Even in death, these commoners are oppressed by their cruel lords. Wights, deathlocks, and vampire spawn might serve as the soldiers of the tyrants, while the overlords themselves may be vampires or mummy lords, still ruling from their ruined keeps.

All of the kingdomâ€™s cursed nobles bow before the Bone King, who embodies the concepts of death and decay. A lich in rotting finery, he stands as a warning that even the mightiest lords eventually become dust and bone. He prefers to drain the life slowly from fragments he claims; he wants his hostages to dwell on their coming death while their land withers around them, for lords to turn on their people before he finally kills them all.

#### The Last Desert
Characters proficient in History and Arcana can recognize that these monuments are drawn from dramatically different cultures; some are the work of celestials, while others might have been created by the giants of Xenâ€™drik.

At the center lies a massive tomb-palace. Its style suggests the architecture of Aerenal, but itâ€™s grander than even the City of the Dead. This is The Necropolis - the fortress of the Queen of All Tears, the ruler of this domain. The Queen is an embodiment of misery, and her subjects are largely incorporeal undead, shadows and wraiths from the barren sand. Meanwhile, cruel specters and banshees attend her, along with succubi and incubi who bask in the delicious misery that suffuses the region.

#### The Gloaming
This dark forest leads to the manifest zone of the same name in Eberron's Eldeen Reaches region

#### The Hinterlands
The Hinterlands are the outer edge of Mabar, the collection of planar fragments that are currently being consumed and integrated into the Endless Night. Here, the Hunger of Mabar property has not yet taken hold, which generally makes them safer to visit than other layers of Mabar. The Mabaran properties a fragment reflects vary depending on its nature and how close it is to complete integration with Mabar.

There can be infinite variety in the fragments within the Hinterlands. This largely depends on what plane a fragment is from. Is it a verdant forest of Lamannia? A floating tower of Syrania? Or is it a piece of the Material Plane â€” a fortress plucked out of the Last War or a Riedran village? The second question is how long the fragment has been under siege. To what degree does it retain its original flavor, and how much has the influence of Mabar overtaken it?

### Universal Properties

The Endless Night consumes life and light. Itâ€™s a wellspring of necrotic energy, where light is swallowed by gloom, and unprotected creatures quickly die. Mabar has the following universal properties.

**Necrotic Power**. A creature has disadvantage on saving throws against necromancy spells. An undead creature has 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and advantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.

**Radiant Void**. In order to cast a spell that deals radiant damage or restores hit points, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

**Eternal Shadows**. There is no bright light in Mabar. Any object or effect that would usually create bright light only creates dim light.

**The Hunger of Mabar**. Mabar consumes the life force of living things. For every minute a living creature spends in Mabar, it takes 10d6 points of necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar, creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage, and creatures under the effects of a *death ward* spell are immune to the effects of this property.

**Standard Time**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its areas.
