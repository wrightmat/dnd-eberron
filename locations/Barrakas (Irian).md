### Locations

##### Amaranthine City

The Amaranthine City is the capital of an empire in its first bloom of glory. Gilded banners catch the wind. Armored angels and pegasi patrols pass overhead. People laugh in the streets, healthy and happy. Artisans create a mosaic depicting glorious victories. While this is an empire, the message isn‚Äôt about oppression, but one of potential. This is an empire where all the citizens are prosperous and all have equal opportunities. People are proud, the city is full of wonders, and the future is bright. The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Irian. Its Dawn Empress is the first and greatest of the Architects.

The largest city in the realm is largely populated by embers, manifestations linked to a spark ‚Äî a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature. Each ember should have the appearance and name of a person the party has met during their adventures, but otherwise they‚Äôll act like basic NPCs, just populating the scene and moving about randomly.  An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn‚Äôt fully conscious and doesn‚Äôt have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal‚Äôs brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds.

The city contains a variety of buildings, but some of the most famous are Club Starlight, Desire‚Äôs Den, and Rhea‚Äôs Resort (below). There‚Äôs also a frozen yogurt shop called ‚ÄúIcicles Frozen Yogurt Shop‚Äù run by an Ice Djinn, a clothing store called ‚ÄúEverything Fits‚Äù, and food shops called ‚ÄúChocolate Everything‚Äù, ‚ÄúChai There!‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Good Plates‚Äù.

##### Club Starlight

A rave-inspired dance club that‚Äôs run by a Lumi, who also serves as the bouncer (who glows with positive energy and gives off light for 5 feet). If any player isn‚Äôt feeling positively about visiting the club, they‚Äôll either need to change their outlook for real, or succeed on a DC 18 Deception check in order to get in to the club - the Lumi can‚Äôt abide negativity in his club!

##### Desire‚Äôs Den

This club/bathhouse/bar is entirely sex-positive and run by Desire, the most powerful creature on Irian (above the Architects), and member of the Endless. All sexuality is welcome and openly embraced here, and the den also represents the concept of fertility. The symbol of the club is a heart made of cut glass. Desire's Den has smooth, red, curvilinear walls and floors throughout, made of something similar to epoxy.

The inside of the club consists of a communal bar and lounge, indoor bathhouse (whose waters act as Desire's scrying pool), private rooms, and private gallery where Desire spends most of their time. There is also a direct connection to Club Starlight next door. Although the gallery is Desire's own space, they allow anyone to enter and speak to them at any time. The gallery is decorated with white hanging paintings of each of the Endless sigils.

##### Rhea‚Äôs Resort

A Ki-rin ranch can be found just outside of the Amaranthine City, between Desire's Den and The Garden. The ki-rin here aren‚Äôt contained in any way and actually run the place themselves, but they freely choose to give visitors and angels rides around the plane. The leader is a Ki-rin female (said to be exceptionally rare), named named Rhea, who has gathered all the others males as a sort of harem.

Females are velvety blue, while the men are gold.

#### The Refuge

### Universal Properties

The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. Irian has the following universal properties.

**Radiant Power**. When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points or deals radiant damage, it‚Äôs treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

**Necrotic Void**. In order to cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

**Pure Light**. There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness only reduces the lighting to dim light.

**Life Triumphant**. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This has no effect on undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.

**The Light of Life**. The light of Irian restores vitality, granting the following benefits to all living creatures. These have no effect on undead or constructs; however, undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal, benefit from these effects as if they were living creatures.

- On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a living creature with at least 1 hit point regains 3 (1d6) hit points.
- A living creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn.
- A living creature has resistance to poison damage.
- A living creature has advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and fear.

**Standard Time**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.
