### Locations

#### Nullius Terram
One of the largest layers, Nullius Terram is a battlefield the size of a small nation. It’s divided by several deep, heavily fortified trenches, which are separated by blasted regions of scorched earth, blast craters, and bones. Nullius Terram’s multiple trench lines twist and curve throughout the region, and in the lands between the trenches lie strategic outposts.

The region is marked by constant barrages and terrible tools of mass destruction — widescale cloudkill, curses that transform conscripts into killers, and worse. Tyranny, Cruelty, Freedom, and Justice are the four active legions in this region. Justice has a difficult position in Nullius Terram, but has been slowly gaining strength. Periodically, the commanders send troops to clash in the fields between the lines, either in simple skirmishes or full offensives. Ultimately, the theme of this layer is that of slow, agonizing stalemate, and the suffering war can inflict on both the land and the soldiers.

#### The Burning Sky
The sky is filled with many airships, some large enough to be floating towns. A few islands of rock float amongst the solid clouds, but if there’s any land below, it’s hidden by deadly fog. While there are skirmishes on the stone islands, most of the action occurs in the skies. Winged angels and fiends circle and duel, while conscripts guide dragons and other aerial mounts. The winged angels currently hold the area with a slight edge over the other legions.

#### The City of Knives
It looks like this was once a city of marvels, with towers rivaling those of Sharn, gilded monuments, museums, gardens, and more. But the City of Knives lies between vast armies of the Legions, and it represents the impact of brutal war on a glorious city. Ongoing bombardment is a constant threat. The civilian conscripts are fighting their own war for shelter and supplies; some rally together for the common good, while others have become looters and brigands. Justice and Tyranny hold their positions on either side of the city, relying on bombardment and occasional assaults. The Legion of Cruelty spreads terror within the city (and currently hold a slight edge over the other legions), while the celestials of the Legion of Freedom seek to rally the common people against all enemies.

#### The Bloody Sea
There are no continents in this aquatic layer, but a handful of islands support the warring fleets. Grand and powerful warships clash in the open waters and bombard settlements. The ships may be familiar, but there are many other unusual engines of war: constructed krakens, submersible warships, monstrosities and dragons bound to service — wonders that the people of Eberron can imagine but can’t yet create.

#### The Warring Cities
At first glance, this layer looks like the blasted land between the trenches of Nullius Terram. It’s home to a number of warring cities, but they aren’t static settlements. Rather, some are floating fortresses that dwarf the Argonth of Breland, and others walk on two legs. The warforged colossus in Eberron: Rising from the Last War could be used as a model for a small fortress.

#### The Destroyed Depths
A network of underground tunnels that connects most other areas of the plane.

#### The Fulcrum
The Fulcrum is the home of Destruction and takes the form of an empty wasteland, seemingly trapped in a never ending, destructive sandstorm. The only thing that can be seen here is a gargantuan sword, driven into the ground.

### Universal Properties

There’s a part of you that’s always been in Shavarath, a sliver of your soul that’s always been at war. When you’re in Shavarath, those instincts guide you. It’s easier to strike a deadly blow, or to grit your teeth and fight on through pain or injury.

**War Magic**. When a creature casts a spell that grants a bonus to AC, attack rolls, or saving throws, or a spell that grants temporary hit points, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

**Unquenchable Fury**. A creature has advantage on saving throws against any spells or abilities that charm a target, as well as against the calm emotions and sanctuary spells. In addition, the duration of these effects are halved, to a minimum duration of 1 round. While a barbarian is raging, its rage can’t be ended early unless it’s knocked unconscious.

**Fight On**. On a creature’s turn, it can use a bonus action to spend 1 Hit Die. It rolls the die and adds its Constitution modifier, regaining hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). Once a creature benefits from this property, it must finish a short or long rest before it can do so again.

**Bloodletting**. When a creature scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, it can roll one of the attack’s damage dice one extra time and add it to the extra dice of the critical hit.

**Flexible Time**. Time’s passage varies between Shavarath’s layers. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane; if you spend an hour fighting in the Burning Sky, an hour passes in Eberron. But other layers move at different speeds; you can spend a month in the trenches of Nullius Terram and find that less than three days have passed in Eberron. A creature with proficiency in Arcana can determine the passage of time in their layer by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
