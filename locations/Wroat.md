Wroat is the capital city of the nation of Breland, housing both the royal family and the royal parliament. The great walled city is built on opposing banks of the Howling River just before it flows into the Dagger River. The city also occupies a man-made island that sits in the middle of the river and it is here that Brokenblade Castle as well as the Citadel can be found.
