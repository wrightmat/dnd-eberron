The people of Rhiavhaar have always been the finest shipwrights and sailors of Sarlona; but they weren’t simply merchants or fisherfolk. Long before their descendants settled the Lhazaar Principalities — named after the notorious Rhiavhaarian explorer — they were known for their piracy. In general, Rhiavhaarians were seen as wild, capricious, and dangerous; “Rhiavhaarian luck” was a common curse suggesting that fortune favors a scoundrel.

While it was never as despised as Ohr Kaluun, Rhiavhaar was also never loved by the people of Sarlona. Internally, the Dreaming Dark exacerbated the feuds between clans. Externally, they fanned the flames of those who desired vengeance for generations of Rhiavhaarian reaving, and further convinced people that the Rhiavhaarian “cousins” were fiends, not fey.

While the region was firmly under Inspired control during the Age of the Dreaming DArk, the people of Rhiavhaar weren’t as devoted as their counterparts in Nulakesh or Corvagura. There was, perhaps, still a touch of fey wildness in the Rhiavhaarian people. The Edgewalkers patrolled the wild zones, but they couldn't cover all the manifest zones tied to Thelanis. Meanwhile, the various tools of the Inspired — the Voice, the dreams, the remote viewing of the Thousand Eyes — could be unreliable in those areas.

Rhiavhaar today serves as the western hub for sea traffic, and Dar Ulatesh is the legitimate port of entry for visitors and merchants. As Inspired influence has waned over the years, fey influence has increased drastically, rebounding from centuries of distance. Travel to Thelanis is common, and Rhiavhaar has quickly become one of the most popular kingdoms in Sarlona.

### At A Glance

* Population: 2,260,000 (85% humans, 6% shifters, 4% changelings, 3% ogres/ogre mages, 2% other)
* Environments: Temperate plains and marsh
* Major Settlements: Dul Jhaar, Dar Ulatesh
* Planar Elements: Rhiavhaar has wild zones tied to Lamannia, Thelanis, and Shavarath, and the influence of all three planes can be seen in its history. The Rhiavhaarian knack for sailing is due in part to the unusual lumber harvested from their Lamannia wild zones; Rhiavhaarian ships have always been faster and more durable than their counterparts in other nations. Beyond this, Rhiavhaarian sailors have long known tricks for finding favor with wind and water. Some of these were tied to Lamannia and a limited form of primal magic. Others were tied to bargains with the fey, whether the friendship of a minor mischievous sprite or a pact made with an archfey. But adding to the touch of these planes, the influence of Shavarath has long driven the Rhiavhaarian people to piracy and reaving, and anyone who lived on the Sarlonan coast dreaded the sight of their sails.

### Religion and Culture

Alliances with the fey were a crucial part of Rhiavhaar’s culture. The fey-favored families rose to power, and feuds between archfey often played out in Rhiavhaar. While many of the champions of Rhiavhaar could be considered to be Archfey warlocks, this tradition wasn’t as developed or understood as it was in Ohr Kaluun; Rhiavhaarian warlocks generally stumbled into their pacts, and only a few wielded significant arcane power. The Rhiavhaarians valued their connections to their fey “cousins,” but they placed much of their faith in strength and steel. As a result, many of the benefits Rhiavhaarians received from the fey were closely tied to location—and as such, were largely lost when Rhiavhaarians crossed the seas to Khorvaire.

### Art and Architecture

Architecture of Rhiavhaar heavily borrows from the extravagant feyspires and other buildings of Thelanis.

Stories are the primary art form throughout the kingdom, with both oral and written traditions being common.

### Food and Fashion


### Development

* Rhiavhaar, with the help of knowledgeable people from Syrkarn, was the first to establish representative democracy in Sarlona, during the Quiet Year.
* During the Quiet Year, Eberron dragonshards were discovered in the marshes of Rhiavhaar.
* In order to get a handle on their crime problem, the new Rhiavhaarian government established a military force, that really just drove the crime underground.
* Rhiavhaar invested heavily in tourism during the end of the Quiet Year, brining many outsiders into the region and drastically increasing their population (fantasy New York City).
