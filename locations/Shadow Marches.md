The Shadow Marches are little more than fetid backwater swamps where Orcs have lived for thousands of years. Still, a glimmer of civilization lingers here, if one has enough tenacity and endurance to seek it out.

The primary crop of the area (both here and Droaam) are dirt potatoes.

### Locations

- **[[Zarashâ€™ak]]**. The unofficial capital of the region and headquarters of [[House Tharashk]].
- **[[Urthhold]]**. Small village, but primary dock for larger ships approaching the Shadow Marches by water.
- **Patrahk'n**. Patrahk'n is a relatively small orc town, which is arranged in a circle surrounding the central Competition RIng (where regular gladiatorial matches are held). The House Tharashk Enclave and its attached buildings make up the west side of the surrounding circle, while 'Aashta Alchemy, Farghed's Fishery, and a row of merchant's tents make up the east side of the circle. Outside of those are the huts that serve as residences for the citizens.
- **Valshar'ak**. A small town, and home to Valshar'ak Seal, a secret society within House Tharashk composed of members of the Gatekeepers druid sect. They seek to channel Tharashk resources to further their goals of fighting back the Dragon Below.
- **Yrlag**. One of the largest cities in the Shadow Marches, itâ€™s one of the few safe havens on Crescent Bay, and the most substantial port on the west coast of Khorvaire. Yrlagâ€™s particular claim to fame is its proximity to the Demon Wastes. Due to the diligence of the Ghaashâ€™kala, landing on the coast is far easier than crossing the Labyrinth. With this in mind, Yrlag is to the Demon Wastes as Stormreach is to Xenâ€™drik â€” a jumping off point and safe haven for scholars, explorers, and opportunists keen to take their chances in the Wastes or to acquire goods recovered from it.
- **Glumtown**. 
- **Eberron Dragonshard Fields**. The Shadow Marches are blessed with the largest concentration of Eberron dragonshards known to exist in Khorvaire. These fields lie in shallow pools within swamps and marshes, where the shardsâ€™ encasing stone shells hide beneath the tepid, scum covered water. Some of the stone shells have cracked open, and in such cases a subtle crimson light glows beneath the surface of the pool.
	- The largest single source of Eberron dragonshards in the Marches can be found on the western bank of the Glum River, between Glumtown and Zarashâ€™ak. Hard to find and harder to harvest, the dragonshard fields reluctantly give up their prizes, even to the most determined prospectors. The encasing geode-like stone shells, not unlike large eggs in shape, are difficult to open without damaging the crystalline shards hidden within them. Plus, working through muddy water that ranges from waist deep to deeper than most humans are tall, with its share of hostile and dangerous creatures, can be challenging as well.
	- The larger fields, marked and cataloged by House Tharashk or one of the more powerful tribes in the area, usually have guards to protect them from poachers. The field between Glumtown and Zarashâ€™ak, for example, is patrolled around the clock by Tharashk militia and protected by various spells and enchantments. As for harvesting, the process is slowand arduous, and House Tharashk only processes one or two stone shells every month. From a single shell, depending on its size, the house can produce a handful of large dragonshards or as many as three dozen small shards (such as those used to create spellbooks and magic items).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* To find dragonshard geodes, the players should roll an Investigation check. Using a spell like *Locate Object*, or using a magic item to a similar effect, will grant advantage on this check. The result of the check will determine the geode found (on a 10 or greater), per the table below. Only one check can be made per hour (total, not per player, they should determine who makes the check).
