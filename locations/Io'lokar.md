>From the moment it appears on the horizon, the city is a beacon against the darkening sky. Walls of white rise and twist against the highest reaches of the black peak, gleaming in the day‚Äôs dying light. From one of the great towers that ring those walls, dark shapes shoot up ‚Äî wyvern riders, from the look of them, winging into flanking position to shadow your approach. Atop the closest tower, dragons are perched, watching you idly. Beside them stand giants armed with mighty greatswords, the nighttime city beyond them blazing with spell-light.

Throughout their long history, the dragons of Argonnessen have built no cities for their own kind. However, some thirty centuries ago, a great nondragon city called Io‚Äôvakas was founded by the Warders ‚Äî a group of a dozen dragons dedicated to improving the lot of Argonnessen‚Äôs lesser races. With dragon magic and the labor of nondragon subjects collected from across Eberron, the Warders built a walled enclave deep in the south of the Vast. Under the tutelage of their draconic lieges, the citizens of Io‚Äôvakas ‚Äî the Gate of Knowledge ‚Äî became enlightened dragon worshipers with an advanced understanding of nature, science, and magic.

Today, Io‚Äôvakas is a mass of shattered stone jutting up from ground made barren by dragon fire. But each morning as the sun rises above those ruins, it reflects off distant towers against the slopes of a bare peak to the west. This place is very much alive; it is Io‚Äôlokar, the City of
Knowledge ‚Äî risen from the ashes of Io‚Äôvakas a thousand years ago.

Even among the nondragons of Argonnessen, Io‚Äôlokar is often thought of as myth. Beyond the dragon continent, many experienced adventurers have never heard of it. Argonnessen is a land of high-level and epic campaigns, and nowhere is this fact reflected more than in the City of Knowledge. From the highest to the lowest, the Io‚Äôlokari are unequaled warriors, brilliant sages, powerful spellcasters, and masters of the arts of a dozen races.

Most NPCs in the city have levels in three or more classes ‚Äî a primary vocation (often handed down from parent to child), secondary vocations taken from interest, and a spellcasting class. Children here take their first class levels by early adolescence. The Io‚Äôlokari are the masters of vocations both great and mundane, and all reap the benefit of their advanced society. A lowly clerk living in the Freeward
might well be an adept whose accumulated knowledge would make a Morgrave professor weep.

The people of Io‚Äôlokar do not have access to the full power of dragon magic. The fate of the giants of Xen‚Äôdrik has ensured that no nondraconic culture will ever be granted such a boon again. Nonetheless, magic permeates every corner of the city and every one of its people, and a first visit to Io‚Äôlokar can induce awe in even jaded explorers.

Within the city, spell-light is infused into the air itself, rising and falling according to the time of day and the presence of passersby. Residents and visitors alike within Io‚Äôlokar‚Äôs walls can access the powers of flight (as a *fly* spell) and short-distance teleportation (as
*dimension door*), though teleporting into or out of public spaces is considered somewhat rude. Magic tempers the climate and the seasons, feeds the city‚Äôs people, and hones the skills of its scholars, artisans, and workers to unnatural levels.

The Io‚Äôlokari are not given to ostentation or casual displays of power, however. The city has no floating towers or wanton exhibitions of sorcerous might. Though its walls and buildings are reinforced by arcane power, they were raised one stone at a time. However, within these nondescript apartments of multicolored marble can be found collected lore rivaling that of Morgrave, Wynarn, and Korranberg combined ‚Äî all the product of a humble working-class people whose lives more closely resemble those of lords and kings.

### Characters

* 

### Locations

Io‚Äôlokar consists of five walled wards rising up the slope of the mountain. Like the draconic culture on which it was modeled, rank and respect for power are the heart and soul of the city. Wards are defined by the work that goes on there and the relative power of their residents. In general terms, the higher the ward, the higher the level of the characters to be found there.

#### The Freeward

Io‚Äôlokar‚Äôs lowest ward seems misnamed to many first-time visitors, since the people here are no freer than anywhere else in the city. However, the original translation from Draconic involves the concept of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù from authority and power. The people of this ward are thus the lower castes ‚Äî the mundane servants, laborers, smiths, crafters, and clerks who keep the city going. Most visitors need this fact explained to them, however, because the Freeward bears more resemblance to a noble‚Äôs enclave than any Khorvairian working-class borough. Buildings here are a riot of color and architectural styles, and the nighttime streets are alive with music and light.

Visitors to the city are initially welcome in the Freeward and nowhere else, but because the city sees few travelers, inns are nonexistent here. Most taverns feature private dining rooms easily converted to short-term residences for the right barter price. Alternatively, PCs can seek lodging in private homes.

The wall gates that lead to the upper wards are unguarded, and citizens of Io‚Äôlokar move through the city at will. However, strangers are easily recognized, and will be stopped and questioned as to their business. Those not in the upper wards at the invitation of a resident are politely directed back to the Freeward. A second warning often finds characters deposited by force outside the city gate.

* **The Moontowers**. Jutting from the city walls like upswept spears, the thirteen Moontowers serve as watch points and guard posts for the Arnaaracaex. Connected to the city by great arched stairways, each tower is ringed with dragon skulls magically embedded into the stone, a dark reminder of how seriously the Arnaaracaex take their duties. The great towers also provide landing sites for dragons and other flying visitors, and are where any visiting dragons lodge while in the city. Beneath the top-level living quarters of the stone giants lie a series of spacious draconic guest chambers accessed from the outside tower walls.
* **The Steelbenders**. This loose affiliation of weaponsmiths and armorsmiths resembles many of the crafter and artisan enclaves of the Freeward. Its residents live in palatial second- and third-floor apartments above well appointed workshops whose anvils ring from morning to night. Many of the city‚Äôs crafter enclaves open their homes to visitors with demonstrable skill in the same areas. In addition, the smiths here trade their services for foreign arms and armor they have not seen before (including weapons of Xen‚Äôdrik and Sarlona). Like most smiths in the city, members of this enclave work only on magic armor and weapons.
* **House of Life**. This enclave of adepts and clerics is one of many spread throughout the city, its members studying together and spreading well-being among their fellow citizens. Healing is just another part of the overall system of barter in place within the city. However, members of this house freely cast healing, restoration, raise dead, or even resurrect for strangers if convinced that a party can ultimately offer something to Io‚Äôlokar in return.

#### The Terrace

Io‚Äôlokar‚Äôs second tier is home to the city‚Äôs professional warriors and scouts, and to lower-rank spellcasters. Most of the guides and explorers that a PC party might seek in the city can be found here. The spellcasters of the Terrace are those whose talents keep the magic items and imbued spells of the city functioning. Magic crafters of all stripes can be found here, and the ward is alive with artful illusions and magical entertainments day and night.

* **Public Markets**. Expert crafters display wares of incomparable beauty and quality in the city‚Äôs many markets, and virtually any magic item of the DM‚Äôs choosing can be found at a crafter‚Äôs stall. However, the markets of Io‚Äôlokar operate exclusively on the city‚Äôs system of commonwealth and barter. For the most part, city folk simply take what they need of their fellow citizens‚Äô wares, knowing that the work they do is fair trade for these goods. New visitors to the city can attempt to barter their own services or goods, but are often limited to looking on enviously as the Io‚Äôlokari shop.

#### The Sunward

The first of two tiers that wrap the mountain slope on all sides, the Sunward is home to higher-rank spellcasters, lower-grade academics, and the city‚Äôs most respected entertainers. Its cobbled streets are quieter than those of the lower tiers, but the ward‚Äôs theaters draw audiences from across the city.

#### The Height

This stately ward is a hub of academic and scholarly tradition, and is thus the virtual heart of Io‚Äôlokar. The city‚Äôs four great colleges are here, as are the apartments of their wizards, sages, and loremasters. More so than in the lower wards, the architecture here reflects the soaring stone and crystalline style seen in the draconic observatories of Argonnessen.

#### The Bastion

At the apex of the mountain, the walls of the Bastion protect the chambers and residences of Io‚Äôlokar‚Äôs powerful residents. These are the sages and scholars who direct the work of the colleges, plan the city‚Äôs sanctioned expeditions to sites across Argonnessen, and magically monitor the actions and intrigues of the dragons of the Vast. Unlike in the lower wards, the Bastion‚Äôs wall gate is guarded by four of the Arnaaracaex and powerful magic wards.

### History

The creation of Io‚Äôvakas thirty centuries ago was preceded by centuries of debate and anger among the dragons of Argonnessen. With the Chamber still in its infancy, most dragons opposed the Warders‚Äô plans for empowering the lesser races. The idea of sharing even a small amount of draconic knowledge was anathema to many dragons, the fate of Xen‚Äôdrik still sharp in their memories. In the end, though, the Warders prevailed. Io‚Äôvakas was built in the Vast with the tacit blessing of the Conclave and the Eyes of Chronepsis, and for two thousand years, the city thrived. Then the yuan-ti came from Sarlona, and the doomsayers proved correct.

When the serpent folk arrived in exile, the best among them were invited to Io‚Äôvakas. There, they joined the other nondragons of the city in a bountiful life that included worship of the fifteen ascended spirits of the Sovereigns ‚Äî a gift of faith to the nondragons from their dragon masters. However, at least one sect of the Io‚Äôvakas yuan-ti sought more power than the Sovereigns could grant. In secret, this group claimed the direct worship of the Dragon Gods ‚Äî and the deepest mysteries of dragon magic ‚Äî for themselves.

When this blasphemy was eventually discovered, the dragons who opposed the Io‚Äôvakas experiment demanded a swift and final response. Refusing to distinguish between those who transgressed and the bulk of the loyal yuan-ti, or even the Io‚Äôvakas citizenry as a whole, draconic might was unleashed. Under a storm of lightning, frost, and fire, Io‚Äôvakas was leveled. A dozen or so yuan-ti escaped to the catacombs beneath the city; the rest of the serpent race, including all the priests, was destroyed. From ruined Io‚Äôvakas, a pathetic few nondragon survivors fled to the plains beneath a sky darkened by gathering rogues, anxious to add these so-called scions of knowledge to their own herds.

Then Arnaarlasha, a noble gold dragon great wyrm of the Warders, descended to the wasted plain. She and a dozen elder dragons loyal to her formed a protective cordon around a thousand desperate survivors of the city. On foot, they shepherded their charges across hostile territory to the slopes of Mount Erishnak, a granite peak in the center of Arnaarlasha‚Äôs own adjacent territory. To the assembled rogues and the Soldiers of the Light who had pounded Io‚Äôvakas and her inhabitants to rubble, Arnaarlasha declared the surviving nondragons free subjects of her dominion. Over the year that followed, high on the mountainside, Io‚Äôlokar was raised.

Arnaarlasha never spoke of what drove her actions that day on the plains, nor will she ever do so. Four hundred years ago, the great wyrm‚Äôs death marked the city‚Äôs darkest hour, and a turning point. Within a day, Io‚Äôlokar was besieged by a coordinated attack of rogue dragons intent on claiming Arnaarlasha‚Äôs territory and razing the city. Beneath arcane defenses honed over six centuries, the city‚Äôs mages stood fast. Alongside the Keepers, flights of wyvern riders launched themselves from the Moontowers, harrying rogues in the air as they rained arcane fury against their reinforcements on the ground. After four days, the rogues retreated. Io‚Äôlokar stood fast, and its victory in the Battle of Arnaarlasha‚Äôs Fall is celebrated to this day.

Throughout the great battle, the Eyes of Chronepsis and the Light of Siberys were conspicuous by their absence, a display of indifference they maintain to this day. As long as the Io‚Äôlokari are careful to stay within the boundaries of behavior proscribed for them when Io‚Äôvakas was new, the Conclave seems content to leave the city be. However, both the Io‚Äôlokari and the Keepers accept that the city exists at the Conclave‚Äôs whim. If any nondragons seek the forbidden lore of dragonkind once again, or should any yuan-ti presence be again tolerated, no force of will or lesser magic will be enough to save them.
