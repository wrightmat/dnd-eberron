Pyrine is a land of warm plains and forests, welcoming both in its aspect and its aura. Something about Pyrine inspires calm reflection. When standing in a Pyrinean meadow, it's easy to feel a sense of joy and contentment— to know that somehow, all is right in the world.

Faith was the strong foundation of Pyrine, but the Dreaming Dark was able to use this as a weapon. Dream manipulation allowed the quori to spread false visions, creating schisms and driving zealots to pursue heresy. Nulakesh was again encouraged to extend its power into Pyrine, and even some of the Shadow Lords of Ohr Kaluun were urged to attack. Across Sarlona, quori worked to undermine faith in the Sovereigns; after all, if the gods were just, why would they allow the myriad terrors of the Sundering? Ultimately, people came to see the Pyrineans as servants of the altavars, peddling a faith that bound innocent dupes to the service of fiends. The temples were torn down and the Sovereigns forgotten.

During the Age of the Dreaming Dark, the Sovereign faith had been wiped from Pyrine. The people remained thoughtful and philosophical, but that deep-rooted faith had been shifted to the Path of Inspiration. The region maintained the general aura that encouraged its people to follow the rules and avoid conflict, but that had instead been harnessed in the service of the Inspired.

While most shrines to the Sovereigns have been destroyed, there are a few that weren’t so easily wiped away. There’s a great arch carved of dragonbone, and a few shrines remain hidden in caves or wild zones. Most notably, the common belief was that the capital city of Pyrine was built around the First Library; that city was leveled in the First Sundering, replaced by Dul El. However, it was discovered after the Second Sundering that the actual First Library wasn’t a building on the Material Plane, but rather, a tower in Syrania. This discovery resulted in new pilgrimages to Pyrine from all over Eberron, and the quick resurgence of the Sovereign Host faith across Pyrine.

### At A Glance

* Population: 2,100,000 (93% humans, 3% shifters, 2% changelings, 2% other)
* Environments: Warm and temperate plains, forests, and marshes
* Major Settlements: Dul Zeer, Dul El, Dar Ilash, Dul Durat
* Planar Elements: Pyrine has strong ties to Irian, Daanvi, and Syrania. The effects are strongest when people are close to a wild zone, but even beyond the zones, a general sense of peace and well-being pervades the region. The people of Pyrine are naturally inclined to follow the rules and avoid conflict; even where there are problems, surely they can be worked out. The wild zones of Pyrine are largely benevolent in nature. Under the proper circumstances, some can serve as portals to the Refuge of Irian and the Immeasurable Market of Syrania.

### Religion and Culture

Pyrine was never a conquering kingdom. It was a nation of scholars and sages, and it shared its knowledge freely with its neighbors; Pyrinean tutors and advisors could be found in courts across Sarlona. But there was one pillar that was even more important than knowledge: the Sovereign Host. The form of the Sovereign Host embraced by most Vassals of Khorvaire is known as the Pyrinean Creed; this is because it was established and codified in Pyrine. According to myth, a Pyrinean shepherd stumbled into the First Library, where Aureon taught them the nature of the Host and the basis of Aureon’s laws. True or not, the Pyrineans were people of deep conviction and faith. They had deep and detailed visions of the Host, cataloged in countless scrolls; as a result, they also wielded remarkable divine power, matched only by the crusaders of Khalesh. But they never used their powers for war; instead, Pyrinean priests traveled across Sarlona, spreading the word of the Sovereigns and using their gifts to help those in need.

Largely, Pyrine was left in peace by its neighbors. The Vassal faith became common across Sarlona, and many people did see Pyrine as a blessed land with a special connection to the Sovereigns. One notable exception was Nulakesh; while many Nulakeshi adopted the faith, several emperors used their faith as a basis for invasion — “the blessed land must be protected by the Empire, for the good of all!” There were also periods where Pyrine was targeted by Rhiavhaarian raiders, and one point when a Rhiavhaarian warlord established a new kingdom in Pyrine. However, in time — often due to pressure from other nations, and apocryphally, due to pressure from the Sovereigns — Pyrine was always restored.

### Art and Architecture

Architecture of Pyrine is influenced by the white stone common in Irian, as well as the tower design from Syrania, and the clean angular lines of Daanvi.

### Food and Fashion


### Development

* Pyrine was the first of many regions to establish trade for food with others during the Quiet Year, starting with food to Ohr Kaluun.
