### Characters

* **[[The Architect]]**
* **Zaerith** (CN male githzerai fighter/wizard). The leader of the githzerai monastery and known as The Great Githzerai.

### Locations

#### Sea of Chaos

#### Cornerstone
Cornerstone is the largest of the slaad cities. Its architectural style and precise layout are constantly changing, but itâ€™s always a sprawling city that houses hundreds of thousands of slaadi. Each time the players travel to Cornerstone, roll on the Slaad Cultures table to determine which slaadi are in charge currently. The attitude of slaadi toward adventurers depends on the active culture. Regardless, Cornerstone is the best place to acquire Kythrian artifacts (see [[Trinkets of the Planes]]) or magical services.

#### Zertherun IV
Zertherun IV is one of the monastery vessels of the githzerai. Itâ€™s under the guidance of the zerth, whose mental discipline maintains the stability of the ship. The Great Githzerai Zaerith is a senior monk charged with dealing with outsiders, which is sometimes a matter of diplomatic negotiations, and other times, rallying zerths to defend the vessel from attack. Like most githzerai, Zaerith isnâ€™t inherently hostile toward outsiders, but has no great love for them; his reaction is based entirely on the actions and approach of the visitors.

Kythriâ€™s Broken Rhythms and The Odds Are Odd properties donâ€™t apply in a githzerai monastery, and while Constant Change exists, its effects are minimized. Zertherun IV maintains capacitors for change, such as gardens of small stones and engraved wheels with shifting patterns, which absorb the energies of change and prevent it from transforming the vessel.

#### [[The Shifting Islands]]
There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard.

### Universal Properties

All things change in Kythri, even time and the future. The only thing thatâ€™s truly reliable is that nothingâ€™s reliable.

**Broken Rhythms**. A creature canâ€™t take the exact same action on two consecutive turns. If it previously stood still, it must move. If it previously moved, it can stand still or move a different distance. A creature can cast a spell in two consecutive turns, but it canâ€™t be the same spell. A creature can attack on two consecutive turns, but the second attack must be described as substantially different in style from the one before.

**Fluid in Form.** When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if it has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is doubled.

**Embrace the Unknown**. In order to cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 12 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. Divination spells cast on other planes canâ€™t affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.

**The Odds Are Odd**. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1 or a 2, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the targetâ€™s AC. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 19 or 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the targetâ€™s AC, and is considered a critical hit. If a creature has an ability or item that increases its normal range of critical hitsâ€” such as the Champion fighterâ€™s Improved Criticalâ€”its range increases by 1.

**Constant Change**. Nothing remains exactly the same in Kythri. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe whatâ€™s changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish Aundairian design when it was originally Karrnathi. You could choose for the change to be physicalâ€” your skin, hairstyle, or sexâ€” or mentalâ€” you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the Sovereign Host. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins wonâ€™t turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impactâ€” for example, if your clericâ€™s faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect thatâ€” discuss the possibility with your DM.

**Chaotic Time**. Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.

| 1         | The Grand Concordance of Iron is a ruthless regime that intends to subjugate all slaadi, and then, the entire multiverse. Itâ€™s a strict caste system in which the death slaadi are cruel tyrants and all slaadi serve in the military.                                                                             | Has vast armies drilling (though their tactics and units constantly shift)                                                                                            | No-nonsense. Not totally against visitors, but wonâ€™t put up with much from them.                                     |
| 2         | The Enlightened Lyceum League is a democratic society of scholars and philosophers. They believe in finding a peaceful solution to every problem and a logical answer to every question.                                                                                                                           | A large hillside auditorium makes up the center of the city, surrounded by stone academic building with decorative columns.                                           | Extremely welcoming to all, especially those who yearn for knowledge.                                                |
| 3         | The Final Regency asserts that the Sovereigns have abandoned reality and ordered the slaadi of the Regency to rule the multiverse in their stead until they return. They are fanatically devoted to a slaad-based version of the Sovereign Host and are offended by all inaccurate representations.                | Immense temples and countless shrines to the slaadi interpretation of the Sovereigns.                                                                                 | Welcome adventurers who profess devotion to the Sovereigns, provided they donâ€™t question the Regency interpretation. |
| 4         | The Glorious Union of Flesh asserts that slaadi are the ultimate evolution of life and seek to grant all other humanoids the gift of slaadhood through the chaos phage. They donâ€™t accept the idea that slaad numbers will always remain constant; clearly previous slaad cultures just werenâ€™t doing it properly. | The Spawning Stone is the prominent feature here, which constantly shifts into a new form and sees various slaadi enter and exit it regularly.                        | A very dangerous place to visit! They will actively try to infest any non-slaad who visit.                           |
| 5         | The Confluence of Reality believes that every civilization has something worth emulating, and studies other cultures to find these things. In a Confluence community, you could find slaadi eating Aundairian crepes, playing an Aereni form of Conqueror, and debating the finer points of Daanvi law.            | Varied architecture that can be recognized from all over Eberron - floating towers from Aundair and Breland, huts from the Talenta Plains, and everything in between. | Celebrates extraplanar visitors, desiring their stories and performances.                                            |
| 6         | The Republic of Bâ€™ob is ruled by a red slaad who makes up new laws whenever he feels like it. Why is Bâ€™ob in charge? Well, that was the first rule he made, and the only one he hasnâ€™t changed. And heâ€™s Bâ€™ob! Who else would be in charge?                                                                        | A large red gem throne on which Bâ€™ob sits is the most prominent feature. A notice board has posted all of the rules currently in effect.                              | Uninterested in visitors, as long as the rules are followed.                                                         |
