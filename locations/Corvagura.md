Corvagura is a tropical region marked by deep jungles and lush fields. It had long been the most densely populated region of Sarlona, and it was one of the most powerful and influential of the ancient kingdoms.

In the First Sundering, the quori attacked Corvagura on three fronts. They encouraged the cruelty and narcissism of the worst of the sorcerers, pushing their subjects past the limit of what they would endure. They created a deep, paranoid rift between the houses, leading to destructive vendettas. And they encouraged the spirit of revolution among the people — culminating in the appearance of early Inspired, commoners wielding supernatural powers capable of defeating the sorcerers.

During the Age of the Dreaming Dark, Corvagura was the heart of Riedra, both in terms of population and administration. It was home to both the capital city of Durat Tal and the primary eastern port, Dar Jin, along with other important bastion cities. The influence of wild zones tied to Mabar and Thelanis were largely contained by the Edgewalkers; the Shanjueed Jungle had been called out as the largest Mabaran manifest zone in Eberron, dwarfing even the Gloaming of the Eldeen Reaches. Lamannian wild zones and manifest zones were tapped to contribute to the agricultural programs of Riedra; this included the creation of unusual hybrids, such as the pomow plant.

Since the fall of Riedra, Corvagurans have returned to the wild zones, and the houses of sorcery have become powerful once again.

### At A Glance

* Population: 440,000 (91% humans, 4% shifters, 3% changelings, 1% ogres/ogre mages, 1% other)
* Environments: Warm plains, marshes, and forests
* Major Settlements: Dar Jin, Dar Myan, Durat Tal
* Planar Elements: Corvagura includes manifest zones and wild zones tied to Lamannia, Mabar, and Thelanis. Notably, the influence of Lamannia lends unnatural fertility to the region and its inhabitants. The influences of the other planes were made manifest in two powerful lines of human sorcerers. These houses do protect the common people from many deadly threats, including the colossal beasts that emerge from Lamannian wild zones, as well as the restless dead and capricious fey unleashed by the other wild zones.

### Religion and Culture

Anyone born within the sphere of influence of either Mabar or Thelanis could potentially develop sorcerous powers. The nation of Corvagura was historically born when leaders rallied these sorcerers into two noble houses, then used their powers to conquer the city-states in the region. The new kingdom of Corvagura has seen these houses begin to re-establish:
* **The House of the Sun** drew its power from Thelanis. Its members had powers like those of Wild Magic sorcerers. Their magic tended toward glamour and glory, twisting the thoughts and emotions of others or striking down foes with bolts of flame. Though biologically human, members of the House of the Sun often had fey features and could be mistaken for Khoravar. The sorcerers of the House of the Sun were taught to be proud and glorious, demanding adoration from their subjects.
* **The House of the Moon** drew its power from Mabar. Its members had powers like those of Shadow sorcerers, and their magic drew on darkness and inspired fear. They never animated the dead, but they could command shadows and summon specters. The sorcerers of the House of the Moon were taught to be calm and cruel, instilling terror in any who might challenge them.

While these houses are presented as families, one’s position within them was based entirely on sorcerous power. Anyone who manifests such powers is adopted into the appropriate house, while any heir who fails to show sorcerous talent by their eighteenth birthday is cast out. The majority of the sorcerers of Corvagura are convinced that their powers elevated them above the common people, and they are infamous for their casual cruelty and tyrannical rule.
