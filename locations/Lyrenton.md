Lyrenton was a town of the nation of Cyre, now lying in eastern Darguun, close to the dead-gray mist on the border of the Mournland. It lies on an Orien trade road from the Gathering Stone and leading into the Mournland, into the Field of Ruins.

Once prosperous, Lyrenton now lies in ruins. The Ghaal'dar tribes think it to be cursed and a place best avoided.

The ruins somehow attract monstrosities from out of the Mournland. Moreover, those who enter and breathe the air risk developing a strange wasting disease within the day.

There are reports of terrible wailing coming from the ruins. At night, their echoes carry over the plains for miles.
