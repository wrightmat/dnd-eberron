The smallest of the the three cities of Zilargo, Zolanberg is best known for its mines. While not as rich as the entire expanse of the Mror Holds, the mines of Zolanberg are a strategic asset to the nation. The mines come with plenty of trouble, not just from the environmental impact of mining but also the native kobolds that live in the Seawall Mountains. Zolanberg ties into Trolanport's Elemental Binding trade by providing the Khyber shards it uses.

Zolanberg's mines are constantly expanding as they extract the mineral wealth of the Seawall Mountains. While Zolanberg and its immediate area are mined out, the city claims dominion over the entire mountain range, and miners bring their findings to the city to engage in trade with the wider world.

Centuries ago the city brought in dwarves from the Mror Holds as consultants, and in the time since a sizeable dwarf population has established itself. While the dwarves lack political power, they have a stable economic influence.

Key to the actual process of mining is access to other natural resources, namely timber and water. While the Lyrris clan has the largest stake in the region's Khyber shard mines, and the Zolan clan has made a name for itself with its silver mines, both must negotiate with the other, as the Lyrris clan holds many of the local water rights while the Zolan clan has a majority of the logging rights. The incomplete nature of each clan's dominance means they must work together even as they scheme against each other

Only three (non-Sivis) houses have a major presence in Zolanberg - Orien (lightning rail stop), Kundarak (security services, specifically a large vault), and Tharashk (prospectors). The somewhat isolated nature of the city, plus the insular nature of the gnomes, makes it difficult for the others to make much profit in Zolanberg, even if they keep small enclaves.

While New Cyre and Sharn are well-known as the home of Cyran refugees, a lesser known fact is that the gnomes of Zilargo were especially hospitable. While the first refugees were from those who fled West out of South Cyre (modern Darguun), the communities swelled after the Day of Mourning. The refugees in Zolanberg don't hold any political power, but their community is looked after with kindness by the Council of Nine.

The community leader is Zunia Harun, an older gnome woman who is the descendent of one of the original refugees from South Cyre almost two decades ago (Zinat Harun).

### Secrets and Clues

 - [ ]  The Haka'jhar nation of kobolds calls the Seawall mountains home. Classed as "Irvhir" kobolds, they claim to have been formed directly from the blood of Khyber. Intensely xenophobic, the kobolds have failed to hold back the steadily encroaching gnomish mines.

### Important Locations

* **Lightning Rail Station.**
* **The Drunken Dwarf.** The townâ€™s tavern is run by one of the dwarf families that were brought here as consultants generations ago. Now Kellark Narathun runs the day-to-day operations. The tavern is incredibly popular with the dwarves and gnomes who work the mines.
* **Copper Dragon Inn.** Run by the copper dragonborn bartender named Tardath. A stationary Brass Bards troupe started up here just a few weeks ago, led by a charismatic dwarf leader who always wears a brass ring on every finger.
* **Community Hall.** A small gathering hall sits in the center of town, near the vault. Zunia Harun, the leader of the Council of Nine, resides here as well.
* **The Central Vault.** House Kundarak protects Zolanberg's gem inventory in a huge vault within the city.
* **Prospector's Guild Hall.** House Tharashk operates a significant operation in the city via the Prospector's Guild and recently built a large new facility.
* **Khyber Dragonshard Mine.**
