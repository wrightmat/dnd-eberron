 #location #castle/fort [[Karrnath]]

Loom Keep is a fortification in Karrnath. It lies just west of Karrlakton, situated along the Cyre River and on the southern border with the Mournland. It is now under the control of the vampire Escher Belasco, who was given domain over it by King Kaius ir'Wynarn III.

### Characters

* **[[Escher Belasco]]** (NE male vampire/human castellan). Escher is the vampire subject of King Kaius who rules over Loom Keep, while keeping an eye on Karrlakton.
* **Marissa Tarlov** (female human soldier). Marissa is a human in her mid-thirties, a former soldier of Karrnath who now serves as the chief steward of Loom Keep. With short-cropped black hair and piercing green eyes, she carries herself with the discipline and authority of her military background. Marissa is fiercely loyal to Karrnath and reluctantly serves under Escher Belasco, though she has deep reservations about his methods and true intentions.
* **Thaldor Stoneshield** (male dwarf blacksmith). Thaldor is a dwarf blacksmith and former mercenary who now serves as the master armorer at Loom Keep. With a rugged appearance, a long braided beard, and numerous scars from past battles, Thaldor is an imposing figure. His skill in crafting weapons and armor is unmatched, and he takes great pride in his work.

### Locations

* **The Crimson Hall**. The Crimson Hall is a grand chamber within Loom Keep, named for its blood-red tapestries and dark, imposing decor. This hall serves as Escher Belasco's throne room and meeting place, where he holds court and makes decrees. The walls are adorned with ancient weapons and portraits of past rulers, adding to the hall's intimidating atmosphere.
* **The Iron Bastion**. The Iron Bastion is a fortified complex within Loom Keep dedicated to the training, housing, and equipping of the keep's military forces. This impressive structure is both a barracks and a state-of-the-art armory, overseen by Thaldor Stoneshield. The Iron Bastion is a testament to Karrnathi military engineering, designed to withstand sieges and provide a secure base of operations for the keep's defenders.

### Secrets and Clues

 - [ ]  Escher has been entreating the carrion sphinx Stygianos to reveal the time and place of his death, hoping to ensure his immortality. He has been bringing payment in the form of human corpses. But the sphinx has yet to reveal its exact location, and he's been leaving the corpse scraps at the foot of the Endwall Mountains.
 - [ ]  Escher once met King Kaius ir'Wynarn III long ago, who he immediately recognized as a vampire. But King Kaius didn't want his secret to get out, so he agreed to turn Escher into a true vampire in exchange for his silence (and conversion to the one true faith, the Blood of Vol). The King also gave Escher dominion over Loom Keep after he agreed to keep an eye on nearby Karrlakton, which was controlled by House Deneith instead of the Blood of Vol.
