Dolurrhâ€™s Dawn is a village of 104 people. The origin of the village is a mystery even to those who live there. On 11 Dravago, 996 YK, these people awoke in their beds in the village. Each one of them remembered his or her name and the name of the village... and nothing else. Despite this amnesia, each villager found that they could draw upon talents lying beyond conscious memory â€” skills they couldnâ€™t remember learning. This last year has been a struggle for survival in a very dangerous land. Working together, the people of Dolurrhâ€™s Dawn have crafted weapons, learned to hunt the vicious beasts of the forest, and slowly created a life in this savage land.

A village of amnesiacs appearing from nowhere is strange enough, but the inhabitants of Dolurrhâ€™s Dawn havenâ€™t even realized the true extent of the mystery surrounding their little community. The people of the village know their own names, but they remember nothing about the past... and as such, when they first awoke, they didnâ€™t recognize any of the other inhabitants of the village. But the first travelers who discover this village are in for a shock. A dwarf named Kordran serves as the town blacksmith. His face might seem familiar to anyone who has been to the Mror Holds, and it shouldnâ€™t take long to realize why: Theyâ€™ve seen it carved into the side of the Ironroot Mountains, in a monument over a mile in height. He is Lord Kordran Mror, the greatest king to ever rule the realm beneath the mountains. The mud-spattered huntress is Lhazaar, the explorer who led humanity to the shores of Khorvaire. Galifar I sits at a table with Karrn the Conqueror and Jarot, the last ruler of the kingdom Galifar founded. This is a village filled with heroes and legends â€” yet none of them remember their heroic deeds, nor do they possess the full skills spoken of in the stories. So what are they? Has Mordain found a way to pull these ancient spirits back from the afterlife, in violation of the laws of Dolurrh? Or are these people simulacrums created by the Fleshweaver â€” clones with vestiges of the heroesâ€™ memories, but no true trace of their souls? Either way, what does Mordain have to gain from this experiment, and why has he chosen the subjects that he has?
