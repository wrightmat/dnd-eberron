 #location #district [[Sharn]]

Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn. Its top levels include the seat of the city’s government and its bustling finance districts. Its middle levels host the enclaves of the dragonmarked houses (which some describe as the real government of the city) and embassies of the other nations of Khorvaire. Its location makes its residential neighborhoods highly desirable and its marketplace perhaps the busiest in the city.

### Characters

* **Merrix d’Cannith** (NN male human artificer). Leader of House Cannith's Sharn enclave, who lives in Dragon Towers of the Middle Central Plateau. But he spends most of his time in the Cannith Forgehold in Ashblack, Upper Cogs.
* **Ythana Morr** (LE female human cleric). Archierophant of the Church of the Silver Flame in Sharn.
* **High Priest Phthaso Mogan** (NG dwarf male cleric). The ranking Sovereign Host priest in Sharn.

### Locations (Districts)

#### Lower Central Plateau
>Artistic and eccentric downtown

The Lower Central ward seems to exist in blissful ignorance of the power struggles raging above it. A hotbed of cutting-edge artistic expression and unusual ideologies, Lower Central serves as a counter-cultural contrast to Sharn’s busy downtown.

##### Boldrei’s Hearth (Inn district)
> Hotels, inns, and rooms for rent seem to be everywhere in this district.

Boldrei’s Hearth holds the Central Plateau’s largest concentration of hotels, inns, and other forms of lodging. It doesn’t offer the elite hotels that are found in Highest Towers, Platinum Heights, and Ambassador Towers, but a great number of very comfortable rooms are available.

- **Marquan’s Rooms for Let**: A respectable, if a bit run-down, option for longer stays in Lower Central, Marquan’s offers private rooms with a common dining room. The building is decorated with paintings, sculpture, and pottery produced by local artists, all of whom are past or present residents of Marquan’s. Kielsten Marquan, the owner and sole employee, no longer keeps the place up as well as he used to. This is because Kielsten runs a small cult devoted to a radiant idol, and his attention to his business has slipped as his activity and responsibilities within the cult have increased. Kielsten’s cult holds meetings in a large private room at Marquan’s. Here, the cult members pay homage to their patron, a radiant idol that calls itself Zotharr, Idol of Death. Zotharr demands gifts as part of these ceremonies, and its demands have become increasingly extravagant with the increased loyalty of its cultists. The cultists have been seduced into acts of robbery, kidnapping, and — most recently — ritual murder to please their patron. Kielsten assumed leadership of the cult in the last month, after the previous leader balked at performing a human sacrifice and Zotharr killed him for his disobedience. Kielsten is nervous but sadistically excited about his new responsibilities.

##### Granite Halls (Shops)
> Quirky boutiques and art galleries stand out among a host of more mundane shops.

Granite Halls is one of Lower Central’s two mercantile districts. Compared to North Towers, it has more art galleries and fewer bookstores, but otherwise the two districts are very similar.

- **Sava’s Gallery**: Sava Kharisa (NG female human expert 7/wizard 3) owns this trendy art gallery and serves as the city councilor for the Lower Central ward. Unlike many councilors who are appointed based on their economic position in their home wards, Sava seems to have won her seat on the council purely by virtue of her excellent reputation. She is extraordinarily well connected, with good friends and close contacts throughout the city, and she maintains excellent relationships with most of the merchants of Granite Halls. She keeps in touch with some of Lower Central’s wilder political factions, and is by far the most radical voice on the council. It may be that her only enemies in Sharn are her fellow council members.

##### Myshan Gardens (Average residential)
> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets, and couples stroll arm in arm.

Myshan Gardens is an unremarkable residential district. Its downtown location in Lower Central makes it particularly attractive to younger residents, particularly those with an artistic bent, radical political ideas, or untraditional lifestyles.

##### North Towers (Shops)
> Quirky boutiques and small bookstores stand out among a host of more mundane shops.

North Towers is one of Lower Central’s two mercantile districts. It has a higher concentration of bookstores than any other district in Sharn except the University District.

##### Olladra’s Kitchen (Tavern district)
> Conversation wafts from the open doors of a half-dozen taverns and restaurants, and the tantalizing aroma of food fills the air.

The restaurants and taverns of Olladra’s Kitchen are neither the dens of drunken revelry common in other lower wards nor the high-class, high-priced eateries of Upper Central or Skyway. They are generally subdued, specialty restaurants and taverns that serve as meeting places for artists and ideologues.

- **Ellfate’s Eatery**. Ellfate’s is a small restaurant at the base of Skysedge Tower. It specializes in omelets, witha menu including the Blood of Vol (an omelet made with Karrnathi sausage and red pepper sauce), the Skyway Special (a very light and fluffy dessert omelet served atop whipped cream), and the Eldeen Banquet (loaded with vegetables). It is also a favorite meeting place for zealous mercantilists, a group of political revolutionaries who would like to see the king overthrown and replaced by a governing council of merchant-princes. Though their ideals are similar to the secret agenda of the Aurum, this group is all bluster and no action, and has no connection to the Aurum.

##### Vallia Towers (Average residential)

Vallia Towers is very similar to Myshan Gardens. Its population includes an unusually high concentration of half-elves, but otherwise features the same hodgepodge of artists, revolutionaries, and nonconformists.

#### Middle Central Plateau
>Bustling and fast-paced downtown.

The home of Sharn’s dragonmarked families and an abundance of foreign ambassadors, the Middle Central ward rivals its upper neighbor as a seat of power in the city. In fact, that rivalry is quite literal, as Councilor Senso is a bitter personal rival of Councilor Tomollan of Upper Central. Middle Central lacks the wealth of the upper ward, but makes up for it in political connections across Khorvaire.

##### Ambassador Towers (Embassy district)
> The flags of most of Khorvaire’s nations fly in this district, hanging in front of monumental embassy blocks. The crowds include people of all races and many different ethnic backgrounds.

Ambassador Towers, Sharn’s embassy district, is home to embassies and consulates from eleven foreign nations: Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, Zilargo, Aerenal, and Riedra. A single consul or ambassador heads each embassy. The rest of the embassy staff consists of bureaucrats and clerks as well as diplomats, negotiators, and spies. In the minds of Khorvaire’s diplomatic community, the Last War might not be over—a few years of peace could be nothing more than a brief hiatus from a conflict that lasted a century, and hostilities could erupt again at any moment. Best to be prepared. Cyre’s embassy was established here long before the Last War, and its staff continues to advocate for the interests of the villagers of New Cyre, in eastern Breland.

- **The Brelish Museum of Fine Art**: Breland’s national museum is located in Farhaven Tower, near the Bazaar Bridge leading to Middle Dura. It has two main areas of emphasis: art representing the Brelish spirit (which primarily means any artwork created by a Brelish artist) and antiquities from Xen drik, which certain people in the Brelish government would like to view as a colony of Breland. Its Brelish art collection is unequalled, and includes some world-famous works by great masters of antebellum Galifar. Its collection of antiquities is also impressive, though it is small in comparison to that of the Dezina Museum at Morgrave University.
- **The Citadel**: An imposing, fortified structure near the middle levels of Andith Tower, the Citadel is both the headquarters of the local Knights of the Citadel and the city jail. A great balcony on the outside of the fortress is guarded by knights but allows easy access to this seat of Brelish law in Sharn. Unexpected visitors to the Citadel rarely receive a warm welcome.
- **Athania’s Companions**: One of several “escort services” providing companionship to visiting diplomats in Ambassador Towers as well as well-to-do clients in all of Sharn’s best neighborhoods, Athania’s Companions is unique in at least one respect: it is also a spy ring in the business of collecting, cataloging, and selling secrets. Athania (N female elf rogue 8) runs both businesses. The fact that she is a dragonmark heir of House Phiarlan is her own best-kept secret; not even the majority of her employees are aware of her family connection. The escorts of Athania’s are women and men of beauty and intelligence, trained in the arts of conversation, seduction, and deception. After spending time with a client, they prepare an intelligence report for Athania, who finds interested buyers for any significant items. Some secrets she keeps to herself, holding them in reserve to use as leverage when her cover is finally broken.

##### Dava Gate (Professionals)

> Small businesses cluster in towers surrounded by residential areas, and look little different than the homes around them.
Dava Gate is a quiet district where professional services outnumber trades. Architects and cartographers, barristers and sages, healers and fortunetellers all coexist in Dava Gate’s small business parks. These clusters of professionals are sometimes themed by the type of service offered — for example, one floor of Calsin Tower includes a number of services devoted to animals: an animal trainer, a kennel, a mews, a stable, and a veterinarian — but others are not.

##### Dragon Towers (Guildhall district)

Enclaves belonging to the thirteen dragonmarked houses can be found in this district. Of the thirteen, the most important in Sharn are House Tharashk, House Cannith, House Kundarak, House Sivis, and House Lyrandar. Those five families have the largest enclaves in Dragon Towers, as well as smaller outposts in the areas of the city where they do most of their business.

- **Tharashk Enclave**: The sprawling complex of Tharashk Enclave occupies several levels of three towers near the Sword Point district. A significant percentage of Sharn’s half-ore population lives in this complex. Yevgen Torrn (N male half-orc expert 5/master inquisitive 3/dragonmark heir 1) leads the enclave, and operates as a very expensive inquisitive-for-hire.
- **Globe Information Agency**: This inquisitive agency run by Kava Velderan (N female human expert 6/master inquisitive 3), a dragonmarked heir of the House of Finding, has ties to House Tharashk. Kava prides herself on her ability to find anyone, anywhere. Her agents escalate cases to her attention only when they prove to be nearly impossible to solve.
- **Cannith Enclave**: Cannith Enclave inhabits the whole of Cannith Tower. In both Highest Towers (Upper Central) and Granite Halls (Lower Central), members of House Cannith’s Fabricators’ Guild operate artisans’ shops (upscale trades) in the tower. Merrix d’Cannith (N male human artificer 9/dragonmark heir 3) leads House Cannith’s Sharn enclave.
- **Lyrandar Enclave**: The Lyrandar Enclave in Dragon Towers is relatively small, but only because so much of the house’s operations are housed elsewhere in Sharn. They have several offices in the waterfront districts of Cliffside and Lower Dura to manage the house’s shipping interests, and a large office near the airship docking tower at the top of Lyrandar Tower, in the Highest Towers district, manages the house’s air transport business. Though House Orien controls the land shipping in and out of the city, House Lyrandar has offices in Lower Tavick’s Landing to facilitate trade between the two houses. Solia d’Lyrandar (N female half-elf expert 7/dragonmark heir 4) oversees the enclave and supervises the operations of all the smaller offices, as well.
- **Kundarak Enclave**: Kundarak Enclave can be found in Sivis Tower, as the house commands a major presence in the Korranath district (in Upper Central), where the Kundarak Bank is located. Even so, Kundarak Enclave is large and impressive, with marble columns supporting lofty ceilings with dazzling mosaics of precious metals and stones. Security, as one might expect from the House of Warding, is extremely tight. Daphané d’Kundarak oversees the enclave, but spends most of her time at the Kundarak Bank.
- **Sivis Enclave**: The Sivis Enclave, tightly enclosed in Sivis Tower, shares space with the dwarves of House Kundarak. It has equally grand architecture and ornamentation, though motifs of writing and calligraphic engraving run through the decoration of the Sivis locations. Solirion Torralyn d’Sivis (N male gnome magewright 6/dragonmark heir 5) is the head of the enclave, and supervises the Speakers’ Guild operations in Sharn.
- **House Tarkanan**: House Tarkanan is a criminal organization structured in mockery of the dragonmarked houses. Its leader, Thora Tavin, is not related to the dragonmarked houses, though she does have an aberrant mark — a fact that she keeps secret from even her closest associates. Thora’s residence, a spacious mansion nestled among the towers of the house enclaves, serves as the secret headquarters of her organization. From here, she personally directs a range of criminal and questionable activities throughout the city, with a particular focus on burglary, assassination, forgery, and loan sharking.

##### Sovereign Towers (Temple district)
> This district regales all things holy, or at least their representation in art and architecture. Statues, paintings, and mosaics of deities and saints are everywhere, and great temples stand out among the lesser buildings.

The Central Plateau’s temple district houses some of Sharn’s greatest monuments of faith. Unfortunately, too often these monuments seem cold as the faith that inspired them evaporated long ago, replaced by ritual or even a deep corruption.

- **Pavilion of the Host**: The largest temple complex devoted to the Sovereign Host in Sharn, the Pavilion of the Host consists of a grand open tower ringed by temples dedicated to each of the nine deities in the pantheon. In the central pavilion, sacrifices offered in major festivals and on important holy days honor the pantheon as a whole. The ranking priest in Sharn, High Priest Phthaso Mogan (NG dwarf male cleric 10), leads most of these rituals and sacrifices. Homes for the many clergy working here occupy several tower levels below the Pavilion.
- **Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame**: Sharn’s most important temple to the Silver Flame, named  in honor of the church’s role in cleansing Khorvaire of the stain of evil, ironically may also be its most corrupt holy institution. The Archierophant of the region, Ythana Morr (LE female human cleric 1), helps foster this corruption, while many of the clergy and other staff simply covet privilege, power, and material wealth. The Archierophant, however, actively cooperates with the rakshasa Zathara, who lives in the Central Cogs district of Khyber’s Gate.

> The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame stands proudly in the center of Temple District, its beautiful white towers reaching into the sky- each topped with a brilliant silver flame. Immaculate marble statues line the main walkway to the large silver doors of the building, each apparently depicting a famous paladin, cleric, or clergyman that originated in Sharn. The building itself is made mostly of white stone and marble, with silver window frames encasing beautifully rendered stained glass windows.

##### Sword Point (Garrison)
> Officers of the Watch march to and fro, others stand at attention, and still others drill for combat. Shouted commands and marching songs fill the air.

Sword Point houses the Sharn Watch garrison responsible for maintaining order throughout the Central Plateau and Northedge, with just over 500 guards in residence or assigned to duty in the district.

- **Sword Point Garrison**: This sprawling complex links five adjacent towers into an enormous fortress-like structure. Thick walls crowned with battlements connect the towers along the periphery, while a huge platform connects all five towers to form an open yard for drills, all a half-mile above the ground. The ranking officer at Sword Point, Commander Belew Yorgan (LE male dwarf warrior 3/fighter 5), is a harsh but effective leader. He tries to curry favor with the Citadel, the dragonmarked houses, the city council, and the temple leadership all at the same time. As a direct result, he commits most of his resources and attention to the Upper and Middle Central districts, leaving Lower Central under protected and Northedge practically ignored.

##### Tradefair (Marketplace)
> This district is awash in colorful signs and tents. The shouts of barkers rise above the noise of shoppers, and a dozen scents—from sweet perfumes to sizzling meats — fill the air.

Tradefair, the mercantile hub of the Central Plateau, boasts the quarter’s only open-air marketplace, along with a thriving collection of trades and services.

- **Tradefair Market**: Tradefair Market, the open-air marketplace, operates daily during daylight hours. In contrast to other marketplaces in the city, Tradefair has regulations about stall spacing that ensure relatively straight, wide, and open (though crowded) aisles for customers to walk through. The goods available in Tradefair are generally of high quality, and an abundant number of House Cannith tinkers can be found to make repairs through mundane or magical means. A permit to sell in Tradefair Market for one day costs 1 gp, which certainly guarantees a certain level of quality among the merchants present, and keeps the market from becoming overcrowded.

#### Upper Central Plateau
>Upscale downtown, bustling and frenetic

The Upper Central ward is the most exclusive and expensive area of Sharn’s towers, surpassed in the city only by Skyway. It is home to some of the most powerful individuals in Breland, though it is far from the kingdom’s seat of government. More wealth flows through this single district than many cities ever see. With this great power comes enormous corruption, however, and more evil is done (or at least ordered) in Upper Central than a casual look would suggest.

##### Highest Towers (Civic District)
> The lofty and ornate towers of this district offer panoramic views of the surrounding city. People stride along well-lit streets and gracefully arcing bridges with an air of importance and the smell of great wealth.

Highest Towers is the seat of Sharn’s government and includes all the city offices, the council hall, and other civic features.

- **Council Hall**: Sharn’s seventeen-member city council meets at the top of Sun Tower. Surrounded by a colonnaded gallery and crowned by an observation deck, the council hall offers some of the most spectacular views in the city. The council meets weekly, and an elite troop of soldiers (privately employed by the council) guards the hall during meetings. When the council is not in session, the hall is a tourist attraction, though aides and lesser bureaucratscbustle through its lower halls unceasingly.
- **City Archive**: This large, windowless building near the top of Vasha Tower contains the nearly endless legal and historical records of Sharn. Copies of birth records, marriage rolls, and death certificates are kept in the archives, as well as property records, copies of letters of marque, and records of identification papers issued in the city. Agents of the Citadel have unrestricted access to the records, and other characters with contacts in the government or in a dragonmarked house might be able to gain access to a specific set of records for a single use by calling in a favor.
- **Airship Docking Tower**: Airships arriving from elsewhere in Khorvaire dock at the top of Lyrandar Tower. Skycoaches linger here to carry arriving passengers to other destinations in the city, along with guides hoping to win contracts for work in the city. Of Sharn’s three arrival points (including the waterfront and the Orien lightning rail station in Lower Tavick’s Landing), this is by far the least busy, as well as the safest.

##### Korranath (Finance district)
> There doesn't seem to be anyone here who is not wealthy, and the whole district seems to be set up as a shrine to money itself. Every shop sells only the finest goods, each huge house is impeccably maintained, and the sound of money changing hands fills the air. Even the guards—who are everywhere—seem well off.

Korranath, one of Sharn’s twin financial districts, is also the seat of the Aurum’s power in the city. Named for the great temple of Kol Korran that lies at its heart, Korranath is utterly dedicated to the darker side of the god of wealth—the pursuit of wealth at any cost.

- **The Korranath**: The grand temple of Kol Korran is one of the most incredibly ostentatious and elaborate structures in Sharn. Surrounded by a grand colonnade, the interior of the temple rises in a grand dome a hundred feet across covered with gold leaf and studded with precious gems. The tiles in the mosaic floor are made of precious stones as well, and all the sacral objects inside the temple are solid gold. Sightseers and pilgrims regularly crowd the Korranath, milling under the watchful eye of the temple soldiers employed to protect the fabulous wealth inside. The high priest of the Korranath, appointed by the mayor on an annual basis, is rarely a cleric though he carries out rote ceremonial functions. The current high priest, Kalphan Riak, is a leader of the Aurum. See Riak Mansion, below, for more information.
- **Kundarak Bank of Sharn**: The Kundarak bank, operated by the dwarven dragonmarked House Kundarak, is the largest and most important bank in Sharn. Kundarak holds more loans than the other nine banks in the city combined, including many loans supporting key building projects, past and present. From its perch at the top of Kundarak Tower, the bank wields a great deal of behind-the-scenes influence over every part of politics in Sharn. Daphané d’Kundarak (N female dwarf expert. 7/ dragonmark heir 4) is the leader of the Kundarak Enclave in Sharn and the president of the bank. She divides her time between the house enclave in Dragon Towers (in Middle Central) and the bank, but favors the bank.
- **The Vaults**: The lowest levels of the Kundarak Bank are known as the Vaults, and are almost a separate business entity from the bank proper. House Kundarak offers storage space for small-to-medium-sized items of great value with the highest possible security, at a cost of 15 gp per month (which includes insurance against theft). These are for long-term storage, not for short-term like the safe-deposit vaults described in the Eberron Campaign Setting, and thus can’t be collected magically from other sites.
- **Riak Mansion**: Kalphan Riak (NE male human expert 5/sorcerer 5) is an example of Khorvaire’s new breed of nobility. Not descended from a noble family or a dragonmarked house, Riak made his fortune in the arms trade during the Last War, putting his business savvy and his innate magical ability together to make enormous profit through sometimes unscrupulous deals. His tremendous wealth has earned him a mansion at the top of Andith Tower (just on the edge of Mithral Tower), with open pavilions, sprawling quarters, and even a small garden growing on the towertop. Riak has investments throughout the city and controlling interests in six of Sharn’s ten banks. Perhaps more importantly, he is a member of the Aurum’s Platinum Concord, and conspires with his fellow Aurum members to ensure maximum profitability for  their business ventures while inserting their fingers into every possible aspect of commerce in Sharn and greater Breland.

##### Korran-Thiven (Finance district)
> Armed guards stand near just about every storefront and on every balcony in this district, wearing the livery of private security companies. The buildings are clean and ornately decorated, and money seems to be changing hands everywhere.

Korran-Thiven is the other twin of Sharn’s financial districts, similar in many ways to Korranath but with a harder edge. Its name means “Korran’s Blade” in Dwarven, and the district seems more obsessed with protecting wealth than with acquiring it.

- **Wayfinder Foundation**: The Wayfinder Foundation has a relatively small office in Sharn, but it is a vitally important one for many of the adventurers who operate in Sharn’s depths and Xen’drik. The Foundation liaison in Sharn is Hendra ir’Kavay (NG female human aristocrat 3/rogue 6), a wealthy socialite whose interest in ancient history is largely financial.

##### Mithral Tower (Wealthy residential)
> The homes in this district are large and well kept, showing clear signs of great wealth. True to the district’s name, many of the houses boast mithral filigree.

Mithral Tower is Sharn’s most desirable downtown residential district, comparable to the more suburban Oak Towers and Crystal Bridge districts in Upper Northedge.

- **Tomollan Estate**: Mithral Tower’s most noteworthy resident is its representative on the city council, Javan Tomollan (LN male human expert 8). Tomollan made his fortune working for House Lyrandar arranging trade agreements, but he no longer maintains friendly contacts with that house. He remains one of Sharn’s wealthiest citizens, and the Aurum actively seeks to recruit him for their Platinum Concord—so far, unsuccessfully.

##### Platinum Heights (Fine shops)
> Stores, restaurants, hotels, and a few homes in this prosperous neighborhood are all high-priced and lavish.

Platinum Heights is the finest commercial district in Sharn, home of the most exclusive businesses, from restaurants to magic item dealers.

- **Aurora Gallery**: Aurora Gallery is a unique establishment in Sharn, a magic item auction house. Items worth as much as 130,000 gp market price can sometimes (20% chance) be found at Aurora Gallery. When buying items at auction, characters should expect to pay between 80% and 140% (2d4+6 X 10%) of normal market price. Aurora Gallery buys goods at the normal rate (50% of market price), and buys items worth up to 130,000 gp. They do not usually buy or sell charged items, but exceptions have been made in the past.
- **Gray Dragon Inn**: A luxurious inn near the pinnacle of the Tower of Gold, the Gray Dragon offers elegant suites to visiting dignitaries and others with wealth to spare.
- **Sannid’s Restaurant**: Known for its extensive wine collection, Sannid’s is one of Sharn’s finest restaurants. The cuisine is mostly spicy Brelish fare, with selected entrées representing the best of Khorvaire’s other cuisines, including Karrnathi sausage, Aundairian veal with tomato gravy, and Mrorian stroganoff. Its wines come from all over the world, and Sannid’s proudly offers Aerenal spirits to its most selective customers. Jaetha Sannid (N female human expert 5) is the third-generation owner and head chef of the restaurant, a sophisticated and charming middle-aged woman with silvered auburn hair.

##### Skysedge Park (Park district)
> A park seems impossible in this city of towers, but grass and trees actually grow from the tops of a few towers in this district. A colossal iron statue looks over the entire area.

Skysedge Park is Sharn’s only park district, though Shae Lias (in Upper Northedge) is similar in some ways. Here, three large parks occupy the top floors of some of the largest towers—grass and trees grow in a deep layer of earth atop the towers, artificial ponds carved into the surface shimmer invitingly, and the noise of the city are magically dampened. The population of Skysedge Park includes a small minority (around 400 people) of immigrants from the Eldeen Reaches, struggling to maintain something like their traditional lifestyle in a city that defies the encroachment of nature.

- **Skysedge Park**: The largest of the three parks in this district gave its name to the whole district. Skysedge Tower stands near Highest Towers and Mithral Tower, and contains upscale businesses just below the park. The park is beautifully landscaped, with gently sloping earth and well-tended grass, small fruit trees, and three small ponds. At the entrance to the park, a 100-foot-tall iron statue stands watch. Called the Iron Guardian, it was crafted centuries ago by the artisans of House Cannith. Legends tell that it is a construct crafted for use in the War of the Mark, but it has not been seen to move in the recorded history of the modern city.
- **The Gatehouse**: In Carosten Park, near the edge of the plateau, stands a small stone building. Passersby generally assume the building belongs to the park caretakers and pay it no heed, but it is actually a sacred site to the sect of druids known as the Gatekeepers. From this small shrine in the midst of a “natural” site in the City of Towers, the Gatekeepers monitor the manifest zone, the sewers and ruins below, and the activity of powerful spellcasters in Sharn to ensure that no dangerous planar breach appears in the city. They are not overly concerned with ordinary summoning spells and have little worry that the angels of Syrania are planning an invasion of the Material Plane, but they are deeply worried about recent events in the Depths.
