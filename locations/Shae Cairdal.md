Shae Cairdal is the royal capital of Aerenal. From here, the Sibling Kings rule over the day-to-day workings of the living elves of Aerenal, while the Undying Court guides the nation from Shae Mordai.

### Description

Shae Cairdal was built some some 20,000 years ago, not long after the elves arrived on Aerenal after leaving Xen'drik. They used the forests' great densewood trees as walls for what would become a massive fortress city. The majority of the city sits in the treetops, with a lot of the structures formed from shaped and still-living tree trunks. As a result, it appears to meld seamlessly and beautifully with the forest environment.

Over the millennia since its founding, the city has grown far beyond the original fortress's walls, and the cosmopolitan area now rivals even that of Sharn on mainland Khorvaire.

It is home to more than 50,000 individuals, including the second-highest population of Undying in Aerenal, making it the largest and most populated city on the island continent.

The city is the site of the fortress of the Sibling Kings, comprising a number of massive trees standing at the heart of Shae Cairdal. It is also home to much of the Aereni military, along with barracks and training grounds, many universities of arcane magic, and large marketplaces.

While the city is a hub of trade and talks between the various elven families and city-states spread across Aerenal, foreigners seeking diplomatic contacts or trading partners would do better finding such in Pylas Talaear.
