 #location #capital [[Aerenal]]

Shae Cairdal is the royal capital of Aerenal. From here, the Sibling Kings rule over the day-to-day workings of the living elves of Aerenal, while the Undying Court guides the nation from Shae Mordai (but moved to Shae Cairdal after the destruction of Shae Mordai in 1051).

The city is arranged in a triangular grid, where the central triangle is composed of the Hall of Blades, the Temple of the Deathguard, and the Temple of the Undying Court. The Fortress of the Sibling Kings is in the center of this primary triangle, at the very center of the city, composed of a number of massive trees. A variety of shops, marketplaces, and academic buildings make up an outer triangle, with the Copper Dragon Hotel and Resort as the largest. The majority of residences sit outside of the triangles and are formed from shaped and still-living tree trunks.

### Characters

* **Balaereth and Tezaera Mendyrian** (LG male and female elves). The "Sibling Kings" and current rulers of Shae Cairdal (and with it all of Aerenal).
* **Cial Jhaelian** (NG male elf). High Warden of the Deathguard and Undying Councilor.
* **Elyon Winslow** (NG male elf). Deathgard Warden of Sarlona, and older uncle of [[Thana Winslow]].
* **Kauverra** (CN female copper dragon). The head of the copper dragon's hospitality empire, her office is on the top floor of the Copper Dragon Hotel and Resort.

### Locations

* **Copper Dragon Hotel and Resort.** The headquarters of the copper dragons and their hospitality empire. The top floor is the office of Kauverra the copper dragon herself. The entire hotel is decorated with items of beauty, including prevalent diamonds.
* **Fortress of the Sibling Kings.** The Sibling Kings is the title used for the joint rulers of Aerenal, traditionally a brother and sister of a noble house, selected by the Undying Court. When one of the siblings dies, the other gives up the throne and the Undying Court selects a new pair to rule. The current Sibling Kings are Balaereth and Tezaera, brother and sister of the Mendyrian Line. Their fortress is in the center of the city and composed of a number of massive trees.
* **Hall of Blades.** The Cairdal Blades is an elite military and espionage force in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings, and this is their primary base. Over the last few decades, refugee members of the Undying Court have been slowly filling out the ranks of the Blades, to the point where now the majority of the membership are Undying Court, with the remainder bearing the Mark of Shadow. 
* **Temple of the Deathguard.** The Deathguard are a religious order dedicated to combating evil undead and those who would create them, and is exclusively composed of elf priests and warriors. The Deathguard are led by High Warden undying councilor Cial Jhaelian. Beneath him are four Wardens who are each responsible for Deathguard operations in one of Argonnessen, Khorvaire, Sarlona, or Xen'drik.
* **Temple to the Undying Court.** This large temple contains multiple levels and resembles a pyramid. Within this temple, many guides and priests live communally, and it's used as a gathering place for public rituals.
	* The first level is the public gathering and ritual space, staffed by the _ersvitour_.
	* The second level is the primary religious ceremony space, staffed by the _soungral_ (guides who dress primarily in white, and paint their faces like skulls or wear death masks).
	* The third level is the "Souvrouh of Transition", the space dedicated to the Priests of Transition, the _mordral_.
	* The top level is a protected space known only to the _mordral_, rumored to serve as a space for the Undying Court itself.
	* The basement is a great catacombs, also considered to be a holy place, as it houses the remains (and even still-living souls) of the ancestors.

### Secrets and Clues

* The Undying Court moved from Shae Mordai to Shae Cairdal immediately after the attack, when the high priests were barely evacuated alive.
* Any time the Mark of Shadow appears among the population or Aerenal — only one or two in each generation — the Cairdal Blades are quick to induct them into their ranks. These individuals are then generally trained as rogues.
* More recently, refugee members of the Undying Court from Shae Mordai have been filling the ranks of the Cairdal Blades. This has caused the Blades to be more aligned with the Deathless and the plane of Irian, while the Deathguard are more interested in traditional undead and the plane of Mabar (two sides of the same coin).

### History

Shae Cairdal was built some some 20,000 years ago, not long after the elves arrived on Aerenal after leaving Xen'drik. They used the forests' great densewood trees as walls for what would become a massive fortress city. The majority of the city sits in the treetops, with a lot of the structures formed from shaped and still-living tree trunks. As a result, it appears to meld seamlessly and beautifully with the forest environment.

Over the millennia since its founding, the city has grown far beyond the original fortress's walls, and the cosmopolitan area now rivals even that of Sharn on mainland Khorvaire.

It is home to more than 50,000 individuals, including the second-highest population of Undying in Aerenal, making it the largest and most populated city on the island continent.

The city is the site of the fortress of the Sibling Kings, comprising a number of massive trees standing at the heart of Shae Cairdal. It is also home to much of the Aereni military, along with barracks and training grounds, many universities of arcane magic, and large marketplaces.

While the city is a hub of trade and talks between the various elven families and city-states spread across Aerenal, foreigners seeking diplomatic contacts or trading partners would do better finding such in Pylas Talaear.
