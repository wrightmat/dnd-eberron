Argonnessen is a continent to the far southeast of Khorvaire and southwest of Sarlona. It is the home of dragons, the oldest civilization in the world. The continent of Argonnessen is almost totally unexplored by any race of Khorvaire, and the continent is well-protected against intruders.

### History

Argonnessen was a sanctuary for dragons in the aftermath of the war with the fiends and Overlords. About 60,000 years ago, the dragons began to emerge from the continent to spread across Eberron, encountering a number of emerging civilizations, the largest of which were the giants. Some dragons shared their knowledge with these new civilizations, while others conquered large swathes of the world. However the conquering dragons and the rivalries and competition between dragons created by the conquests caused the Daughter of Khyber to stir, leading the Conclave to put an end to the draconic expansions.

Since then, dragons have only sallied forth in large numbers from Argonnessen once, to destroy the giants of Xen'drik before they could unleash great magical power on their rebelling elf slaves.
