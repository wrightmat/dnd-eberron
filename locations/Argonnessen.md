Argonnessen is a continent to the far southeast of Khorvaire and southwest of Sarlona. It is the home of dragons, the oldest civilization in the world. The continent of Argonnessen is almost totally unexplored by any race of Khorvaire, and the continent is well-protected against intruders.

### Locations

* **The Light of Siberys**
	* **The Pit of Five Sorrows**. The Pit of Five Sorrows is a chasm in Argonnessen that is the prison for the Overlord Tiamat, the Daughter of Khyber. The chasm is heavily guarded by the forces of the Light of Siberys. The pit is one of the deepest chasms in Khyber, and is enclosed in a dome of force and protected by wards to prevent access. At the bottom of the pit is a massive Khyber shard containing Tiamat. Besides Tiamat, the chasm also contains many other powerful entities and secrets. The pit is guarded by dragon volunteers, who consider it a great honor. Dragons who complete their tour of duty to guard the pit are executed to ensure Tiamat does not corrupt them, but many dragons still volunteer in spite of this.
	* **Verthicha'vivex**. This fortress, called the “Mountain of Victory” by its inhabitants, is the primary bastion of the Light of Siberys. Lairs across its slopes house dozens of dragons, and in times of war it is capable of hosting hundreds. Dwarves and giants toil in its great forges, crafting an endless flow of weapons and magic items. Rituals and eldritch machines provide an uncountable array of mystical defenses. If any spot in Eberron is truly impregnable, it is Verthicha’vivex.
	* **Harvest of Pain**. The Harvest of Pain is a wasteland within the Light of Siberys region in Argonnessen that is under the influence of both the planes of Shavarath the Battlefield and Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead.

### History

Argonnessen was a sanctuary for dragons in the aftermath of the war with the fiends and Overlords. About 60,000 years ago, the dragons began to emerge from the continent to spread across Eberron, encountering a number of emerging civilizations, the largest of which were the giants. Some dragons shared their knowledge with these new civilizations, while others conquered large swathes of the world. However the conquering dragons and the rivalries and competition between dragons created by the conquests caused the Daughter of Khyber to stir, leading the Conclave to put an end to the draconic expansions.

Since then, dragons have only sallied forth in large numbers from Argonnessen once, to destroy the giants of Xen'drik before they could unleash great magical power on their rebelling elf slaves.
