Valenar is a nation that broke away from the nation of Cyre during the Last War when the Valaes Tairn mercenary elves annexed the land.

Valenar is located in the southeast part of the continent of Khorvaire. It borders the Talenta Plains to the north and Q'barra to the east, while the Mournland and Kraken Bay lie on its western border. Valenar is the closest nation on Khorvaire to the island nation of Aerenal, which is a short sea journey to the south.

Most of northern Valenar is covered by the Blade Desert, while the southern tip of Valenar is a peninsula containing the jungles of Ravar Orioth. The central part of the nation is covered by plains.

The Valaes Tairn are divided into 45 units known as warclans, each holding between 200 to 500 elves. All of these warclans owe fealty to War Leader Shaeras Vadallia, the High King of Valenar. However, only 20 of the warclans are under his direct command at any one time, known as the Host of Valenar. Warclans serve in the Host of Valenar for 10 years, before rotating out to become independent again. Half of the warclans in the Host of Valenar serve in military operations, while the other half polices the kingdom. Vadallia rewards valiant service with noble titles and land in Valenar, but most elves prefer to remain in the saddle rather than settle down to rule.

With the Valaes Tairn focused on military affairs, the civic administration of Valenar is left to the half-elves of House Lyrandar.

The elves of Valenar have little interest in building relationships with the other powers of Khorvaire. The nation has tense relationships with the Talenta Plains, Q'barra, and Karrnath because of raiding Valenar warbands.

Most of the dragonmarked houses have a limited presence in the country, with the exception of House Lyrandar, who holds land in Valenar in violation of the Korth Edicts and helps run the country, and House Vadalis, who are banned for trying to steal horses.

### History

#### Pre-Galifar
About 10,000 years ago, the Aereni elves founded settlements in the plains in central Valenar. These elven colonies engaged in trade with the goblins of the Dhakaani Empire for about a century. Despite the initial success, the colony eventually became embroiled in a war with the goblins, and the elves voluntarily withdrew back to Aerenal.

The humans of Valenar are believed to have descended from immigrants from the ancient Sarlonan nation of Khunan, which lay in what is now central Syrkarn.

#### Under Galifar
By the time of the kingdom of Galifar, the land had become part of Cyre and primarily populated by humans, with a smaller population of hobgoblins and halflings.

#### The Last War
During the Last War, a faction of the Tairnadal elves known as the Valaes Tairn were hired by Cyre as mercenaries to fight in the war. These mercenary elves fought tirelessly for Cyre in the war until 956 YK, in which War Leader Shaeras Vadallia shocked his Cyran employers by claiming the land now known as Valenar for himself and his mercenary people. He named himself as high king of this new realm, citing the much earlier Aerenal habitation on that land and the blood that his people had shed in its defense in recent times as his justification. With Cyre beset by enemies on all sides, they were not able to contest this loss of land, and the local population did not resist either, as the Valenar levied fewer taxes than their Cyran rulers.

Valenar offered elven mercenaries at discounted services to any nation that recognized them, an offer that was accepted by Aundair in 980 YK, and by Breland in 988 YK. The nation was formally recognized across Khorvaire by the Treaty of Thronehold.
