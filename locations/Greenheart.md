 #location [[Eldeen Reaches]]

Greenheart is a small town and the capital of the Eldeen Reaches. The town is the main base for the Wardens of the Wood druid sect and their leader, the Great Druid Oalian. Greenheart lies deep within the Towering Wood, connected to the town of Niern by a road.

Greenheart's normal population is 1,260. However, the town's population grows significantly during druidic ceremonies and sacred festivals due to thousands of followers visiting Greenheart.

Commerce is not permitted within Greenheart and the town has no marketplace or tavern. The town is mainly dependent on local hunters and gatherers for food, as well as offerings from other communities in the Eldeen Reaches. Outsiders seeking rooms are often sheltered in private homes.
