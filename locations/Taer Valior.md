This enormous pillar stands watch over the former Cyran border. Like the other forts that ring the Blade Desert, it was shaped by the primal magic of Maezan Shal. The uppermost levels feature modified perches, suited for both griffons and airships. An entire clan â€“ the Kel Valior â€“ is assigned to the upkeep of the tower and operations based out of it. Shan Kaelan is the lord of the fortress, a hardened leader interested in the Mournland.

In addition to the clan stationed there, Taer Valior is also home to a sizeable number of Khoravar bearing the mark of storm. While airships tend to avoid flying directly over the Mournland, conscious of flying horrors arising from the mists, Taer Valior is an important stop for airships coming from Starilaskur, an important airship hub.
