This enormous pillar stands watch over the former Cyran border. Like the other forts that ring the Blade Desert, it was shaped by the primal magic of Maezan Shal. The uppermost levels feature modified perches, suited for both griffons and airships. An entire clan â€“ the Kel Valior â€“ is assigned to the upkeep of the tower and operations based out of it. Shan Kaelan is the lord of the fortress, a hardened leader interested in the Mournland.

In addition to the clan stationed there, Taer Valior is also home to a sizeable number of Khoravar bearing the mark of storm. While airships tend to avoid flying directly over the Mournland, conscious of flying horrors arising from the mists, Taer Valior is an important stop for airships coming from Starilaskur, an important airship hub.

### Characters

* **Shan Kaelan** (male elf). A stern and battle-hardened leader, Shan commands Taer Valior with unwavering authority. In his fifties, Shan has silver hair, a weathered face, and piercing blue eyes that reflect his relentless curiosity about the Mournland. He is known for his strategic mind and commitment to the safety and efficiency of the fortress and its operations.
* **Captain Aric Stormrider** (male elf sailor). Captain Aric Stormrider is a Khoravar bearing the Mark of Storm, known for his expertise in airship navigation and combat. With long, wind-tousled blond hair and striking blue eyes, Aric exudes confidence and charisma. He commands the airship "Zephyr's Grace" and is responsible for patrolling the skies around Taer Valior, ensuring the safety of the airship routes.
* **Maelis Kel Valior** (female elf artificer). Maelis is a young, ambitious member of the Kel Valior clan, deeply involved in the upkeep and operations of the fortress. With her short red hair and sharp green eyes, Maelis is known for her keen intellect and engineering skills. She oversees the maintenance of the Griffon Roosts and the Stormward Docks, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

### Locations

* **The Griffon Roosts**. Located on the uppermost levels, the Griffon Roosts are specially modified perches designed to house and accommodate the fortress's trained griffons. These roosts provide easy access to the skies for scouting missions and quick-response actions, making them a critical component of the fortress's defense system.
* **The Stormward Docks**. The Stormward Docks are an airship docking station on the upper levels of Taer Valior, designed to handle the unique needs of airships and their crews. Equipped with advanced maintenance facilities and defended by Khoravar with the Mark of Storm, the docks are a bustling hub of activity and an essential stop for airships traveling to and from Starilaskur.
