>The mission of Strixhaven University is to discover and preserve magical knowledge, to disseminate that knowledge from one generation to the next, to promote free and open study of magic in all its forms, and to enhance the lives of people throughout the world through the use of magic.
 ‚Äî Strixhaven mission statement

Strixhaven University is located on north end of the continent of Argonnessen, on the east end of the Great Barrier, south of the Wyrmsfang Jungle. The school was founded seven centuries ago by five ancient dragons, and has since strived to attract only the most spectacular students from across Eberron, recruiting entirely in secret.

As a Strixhaven student, you start with a well-rounded education in a rigorous first-year program. In your second year, you choose your preferred specialty at one of the five colleges. You can also partake in a vibrant campus life, with plenty of clubs and other activities. You might even play on one of Strixhaven‚Äôs prestigious Mage Tower teams and bask in the adoration of cheering crowds!

### Characters

* **Augusta Tullus, Dean of Order** (LN female human Lorehold professor of order). A professor of spirit studies, she has been called the college‚Äôs most talented pastraiser. She can conjure entire legions of ghostly apparitions to reenact historical events for her lectures. Augusta believes that history repeats itself as an orderly progression toward an ideal. In her view, the mistakes of the past can inform the choices of the present, creating a world of peace and order. She plays things by the book and frowns on students who embark on Dean Plargg‚Äôs dangerous field trips.
* **Plargg, Dean of Chaos** (CG male orc Lorehold professor of chaos). Specializing in military history, Plargg is known for his perfect recall of historical stories, as well as his potent scroll magic. Blind himself, he invented a form of magical embossing called heat lettering, which provides a tactile way to read texts. Plargg believes that history is full of unpredictable, war-filled chaos and that his students must be ready for anything. He teaches that no rewards come without risk, and his excursions typically end with students heading to the infirmary. He pays little attention to Dean Tullus's work, usually dismissing her attempts to find order in chaos as foolhardy.
* **Hofri Ghostforge** (NG male dwarf Lorehold professor of order). When he first enrolled in Strixhaven, he believed his future lay with Prismari. A diligent student, he quickly mastered the technical skills of art, but his magic left something to be desired. After talking with the school‚Äôs counselor, Mavinda, Hofri decided to try his luck with Lorehold. It turned out he had a natural talent for Lorehold‚Äôs spirit magic. His time at Prismari was hardly wasted, however. Combining his artistic skill with his keen spiritual sense, Hofri could visualize a spirit's mortal appearance and construct a viable statue form for them to inhabit. No one in Lorehold's history had previously created a spirit statue from scratch, and Hofri was offered a professorial position after graduation, which he happily accepted.
* **Osgir, the Reconstructor** (NN male stone giant). Even by Lorehold standards, Osgir is obsessed with relics of the past. A professor of order, he treasures every connection to old civilizations, whether it‚Äôs a magnificent jeweled crown or an old shovel. As a student, he constantly spent time in detention for hoarding the best finds from Lorehold dig sites in his room; he lost count of how many times he was sternly told. "History belongs to us all!‚Äô‚Äô So, naturally, he mastered the magical art of duplicative restoration. Not only can he perfectly recreate an ancient object or device from the smallest scrap, but he can also produce a second, identical version for his personal collection. He displays something different every week in his Lorehold office, from a mighty sword of demon-slaying to a delicate elven music box.
* **Losheel, Clockwork Scholar** (CG female loxodon Lorehold professor of chaos). She proudly admits that she is willing to work hard to be as lazy as possible. She turns her brilliant mind to constructing increasingly efficient mechanical helpers, with the goal of one day being able to do anything she wants without standing up.
* **Uvilda Mistcoiler, Dean of Perfection** (NG female genasi Prismari professor of perfection). A master of artistic technique, Uvilda trains with a range of elements whenever she isn‚Äôt focused on her teaching. She is known for giving students profoundly insightful feedback, which she tailors to each individual. After a review, she often offers a small piece of advice that alters the student‚Äôs point of view and work forever ‚Äî for the better. Uvilda believes that good art comes from the head. To her, carefully measured strokes and deliberate object placement make the difference between fully realized art and a total mess. If Dean Nassari interrupts her careful work with bombastic expressions one more time, Uvilda is prepared to enroll in Quandrix to learn how to shrink Nassari.
* Nassari, Dean of Expression (chaotic good genasi Prismari professor of expression). Nazzari always wants to see art that is bigger, more radical in concept, and more emotionally powerful. For their final project as a mage-student, Nassari famously ‚Äúturned in‚Äù an earthquake, which almost destroyed three campus buildings. The piece received a standing ovation from the mage-student
body‚Äîand a grumpy thumbs down from the campus
construction golems. Nassari believes that true expression comes from
the heart. They encourage their students to treat the
entire world as a canvas on which to spread emotion
and excitement. Nassari takes little heed of Dean
Mistcoiler's quiet masterpieces and often feigns for
getfulness about Dean Mistcoiler‚Äôs very existence.



### Locations

#### Central Campus
The central campus is the heart of Strixhaven. Its extensive grounds include residence halls for first-year students, dining halls, administration buildings, classrooms and laboratories (mostly used for first-year classes and interdisciplinary studies), and space for social gatherings.

##### The Biblioplex
The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university‚Äôs main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows
like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.

Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hall ways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.

Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolizing the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.

##### Archway Commons
Just south of the Biblioplex, a star arch curves over head like a smaller echo of the Dawnbow, and a lush park, Archway Commons, marks the site. More familiarly called the Commons, the park is a favorite spot for students ‚Äî especially first-years ‚Äî to gather in fair weather or to wander through on dates. Some of the university‚Äôs clubs also use the park to host social gatherings and games, including live-action roleplaying games and casual sports.

##### Firejolt Cafe
At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside the Biblioplex stands the cozy Firejolt Cafe, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The cafe‚Äôs name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for first-year students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.

##### Bow‚Äôs End Tavern
At the western end of the Dawnbow, where it meets the ground, stands a smaller university landmark: Bow‚Äôs End Tavern, which serves as a hangout for older students. Most patrons come for the live music, deliciously greasy food, and various potions and beverages. Others come to settle their differences in wild duels in the lot behind the tavern. The tavern‚Äôs manager is a kind but strict orc named Tulk ‚Äúthe Bulk‚Äù Tusktooth.

##### Strixhaven Stadium
The stadium where thousands gather to watch students play Mage Tower (and sometimes other sports) is located near Bow‚Äôs End Tavern.

#### Lorehold

Lorehold is the College of Archaeomancy ‚Äî a term that describes the exploration of ancient things through magic. Its mages explore the past by poring over archaeological sites, calling forth magical energy from old tomes, and summoning the spirits of long-dead historical figures. Lorehold mages travel far and wide across the world, gathering relics of bygone ages and learning dead languages to unpack the secrets of history.

Lorehold College is devoted to the study of history, broadly understood to include the various aspects of culture, behavior, and social relationships that shape historical events. Its studies include various subdivisions of history (military history, social history, cultural history), archaeology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, and economics. It overlaps with Prismari College in the field of art history, with some students splitting their studies between the two colleges. Lorehold mages use their magic to unearth secrets and share illumination.

Lorehold‚Äôs two deans carry the titles Dean of Order and Dean of Chaos, as order versus chaos encapsulates the fundamental conflict at the heart of Lorehold‚Äôs philosophy. This conflict revolves around the forces that underlie and drive history. Is the course of time driving toward a well-ordered ideal state or slowly devolving into chaos? Are deep patterns hidden in historical texts, or is time a series of coincidence and happenstance?

The perspective of order emphasizes the structures that pull people together ‚Äî law, religion, economics, education, social class, and so on ‚Äî and how those structures drive historical events. Order focuses on systemic changes and the actions of people collectively.

The perspective of chaos, by contrast, emphasizes individual actions, personal bonds of families and friends, and the disruptive force of lone, passionate people in history. Scholars of chaos gravitate toward reckless discovery and the spirit of adventure in their research of the past ‚Äî the essence and emotion of history over precision or procedure.

The Lorehold campus is located on the northwest of the central campus, in a region of stark vertical relief, near the Fang Crater. Rugged mesas and steep hills rise from a wide plain, and a great chasm holds the excavated ruins of an ancient settlement. Several star arches encircle rocky peaks and outcroppings, testifying to the powerful magical energy in the vicinity ‚Äî energy once harnessed by the ancients who used to inhabit this area.

##### Pillardrop
Part natural chasm, part archaeological excavation, and part new construction, Pillardrop is a series of buildings excavated out of cliffs on the Lorehold campus. Ruins and upgraded halls together are now used for research, classwork, and housing. Precarious bridges link one neighborhood of Pillardrop to another, often directly passing the enormous stone faces of old statues. Every Lorehold class has a story of some careless student making a misstep on one of these bridges or in some particularly crumbling section of the ruins, sometimes with disastrous consequences ‚Äî and sometimes finding deliverance when a spirit statue appears from no where to catch the hapless student before they suffer serious harm.

##### Effigy Row
The heart of the Lorehold campus surrounds a soaring bridge that crosses the chasm of Pillardrop. The bridge and surrounding pathways are lined with monuments depicting historic figures, including past professors and prominent mage-students, as well as war heroes and heads of state from ages past.

##### Kollema Hall
Kollema Hall is a grand, multitiered gallery built into a large outcrop at the end of Effigy Row. Here, Lorehold mages gather for large lectures. At the center of the hall towers a magnificent statue of Kollema, a wise monastic who was one of the first Lorehold professors.

#### Prismari

Prismari, the College of Elemental Arts, is devoted to the study and practice of art intertwined with magic. The mage-students of Prismari wield magic in spectacles of creativity: masterpieces of showy, over-the-top magic. They use elemental magic to express who they are and how they see the world, often combining different types of energy ‚Äî fire, water, air, earth, lightning, heat, cold ‚Äî in powerful expressions of conflict and harmony.

Prismari College is dedicated to the arts. Its scholars view art as the fundamental form of self-expression and magic as a tool, a medium, and an
inspiration. Prismari studies focus on visual arts (including architecture, painting, and sculpture) and performing arts (such as dance, music, and theater). The curriculum overlaps with Lorehold in the field of art history and with Silverquill in the literary arts, and some students divide their time between Prismari and one of those other schools to pursue these interdisciplinary fields. Prismari mages use magic to weave the elements into their creations; they might juxtapose fire alongside paint, ceramics, or fabric, or they might choreograph elaborate works that unite a dancer's movements with gusts and eddies of air.

Prismari's two deans carry the titles Dean of Perfection and Dean of Expression, and they often express the fundamental conflict of their philosophy
as perfection versus expression ‚Äî or, sometimes, as intellect versus emotion. What is the purpose of art? Is it to make people think things or make people feel things? Is it supposed to be carefully thought out or raw and spontaneous? Is mastery of art a matter of honing precise techniques to a point of perfection or of perfectly expressing a raw emotional state? Does art aspire to express universal truths or intensely personal ones?

The perspective of perfection focuses on technique, analysis, theory, aesthetics, and universal principles. It embraces intellect over emotion, strives to be thought-provoking and reflective, and aspires to mastery. Its mages tend to use elemental forces of cold, water, and wind. The perspective of expression instead emphasizes the portrayal of personal emotional truths. Its mages value improvisation, innovation, and rule-breaking, and they often favor elemental magic using fire, lightning, and earth.

The Prismari campus is located on the southwest of campus.

#### Quandrix

Quandrix is located on the northeast of campus.

#### Silverquill

Silverquill is located on the north end of campus, on the border between the school and the Wyrmsfang Jungle.

#### Witherbloom

Witherbloom is located on the southeast of campus, among the large green region known as Sedgemoor.

#### Fang Crater

This pit is hundreds of miles across and punches deep into the earth. The stone rim is blackened and smooth, and volcanic gases rise from cracks and vents in the walls. The crater was caused by a planar incursion from Fernia, when forces from the Sea of Fire flooded into Argonnessen. The Light of Siberys repelled the assault, and the loredrakes sealed the rift. Still, a manifest zone to Fernia remains at the very center of the crater ‚Äî a pit of lava more than a mile wide.

An ancient, ruined observatory is set into the rim of the crater; this plays an important role in the studies of the Lorehold school.

#### Wyrmsfang Jungle

The Wyrmsfang Jungle to the north of the site is the ancestral home of the Owlin people, who have become a common sight at the University over the centuries.
