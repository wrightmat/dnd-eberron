>The mission of Strixhaven University is to discover and preserve magical knowledge, to disseminate that knowledge from one generation to the next, to promote free and open study of magic in all its forms, and to enhance the lives of people throughout the world through the use of magic.
 â€” Strixhaven mission statement

Strixhaven University is located on north end of the continent of Argonnessen, on the east end of the Great Barrier, south of the Wyrmsfang Jungle. The school was founded seven centuries ago by five ancient dragons, and has since strived to attract only the most spectacular students from across Eberron, recruiting entirely in secret.

### Locations

#### Biblioplex

#### Silverquill

The Silverquill school is located on the north end of campus, on the border between the school and the Wyrmsfang Jungle.

#### Quandrix

The Quandrix school is located on the northeast of campus.

#### Witherbloom

The Witherbloom school is located on the southeast of campus, among the large green region known as Sed

#### Prismari

The Prismari school is located on the southwest of campus.

#### Lorehold

The Lorehold school is located on the northwest of campus, near the Fang Crater.

#### Fang Crater

This pit is hundreds of miles across and punches deep into the earth. The stone rim is blackened and smooth, and volcanic gases rise from cracks and vents in the walls. The crater was caused by a planar incursion from Fernia, when forces from the Sea of Fire flooded into Argonnessen. The Light of Siberys repelled the assault, and the loredrakes sealed the rift. Still, a manifest zone to Fernia remains at the very center of the crater â€” a pit of lava more than a mile wide.

An ancient, ruined observatory is set into the rim of the crater; this plays an important role in the studies of the Lorehold school.

#### Wyrmsfang Jungle

The Wyrmsfang Jungle to the north of the site is the ancestral home of the Owlin people, who have become a common sight at the University over the centuries.
