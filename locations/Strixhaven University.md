>The mission of Strixhaven University is to discover and preserve magical knowledge, to disseminate that knowledge from one generation to the next, to promote free and open study of magic in all its forms, and to enhance the lives of people throughout the world through the use of magic.
 ‚Äî Strixhaven mission statement

Strixhaven University is located on north end of the continent of Argonnessen, on the east end of the Great Barrier, south of the Wyrmsfang Jungle. The school was founded seven centuries ago by five ancient dragons, and has since strived to attract only the most spectacular students from across Eberron, recruiting entirely in secret.

As a Strixhaven student, you start with a well-rounded education in a rigorous first-year program. In your second year, you choose your preferred specialty at one of the five colleges. You can also partake in a vibrant campus life, with plenty of clubs and other activities. You might even play on one of Strixhaven‚Äôs prestigious Mage Tower teams and bask in the adoration of cheering crowds!

### Characters

* **Augusta Tullus, Dean of Order** (LN female human Lorehold professor of order). A professor of spirit studies, she has been called the college‚Äôs most talented pastraiser. She can conjure entire legions of ghostly apparitions to reenact historical events for her lectures. Augusta believes that history repeats itself as an orderly progression toward an ideal. In her view, the mistakes of the past can inform the choices of the present, creating a world of peace and order. She plays things by the book and frowns on students who embark on Dean Plargg‚Äôs dangerous field trips.
* **Plargg, Dean of Chaos** (CG male orc Lorehold professor of chaos). Specializing in military history, Plargg is known for his perfect recall of historical stories, as well as his potent scroll magic. Blind himself, he invented a form of magical embossing called heat lettering, which provides a tactile way to read texts. Plargg believes that history is full of unpredictable, war-filled chaos and that his students must be ready for anything. He teaches that no rewards come without risk, and his excursions typically end with students heading to the infirmary. He pays little attention to Dean Tullus's work, usually dismissing her attempts to find order in chaos as foolhardy.
* **Hofri Ghostforge** (NG male dwarf Lorehold professor of order). When he first enrolled in Strixhaven, he believed his future lay with Prismari. A diligent student, he quickly mastered the technical skills of art, but his magic left something to be desired. After talking with the school‚Äôs counselor, Mavinda, Hofri decided to try his luck with Lorehold. It turned out he had a natural talent for Lorehold‚Äôs spirit magic. His time at Prismari was hardly wasted, however. Combining his artistic skill with his keen spiritual sense, Hofri could visualize a spirit's mortal appearance and construct a viable statue form for them to inhabit. No one in Lorehold's history had previously created a spirit statue from scratch, and Hofri was offered a professorial position after graduation, which he happily accepted.
* **Osgir, the Reconstructor** (NN male stone giant). Even by Lorehold standards, Osgir is obsessed with relics of the past. A professor of order, he treasures every connection to old civilizations, whether it‚Äôs a magnificent jeweled crown or an old shovel. As a student, he constantly spent time in detention for hoarding the best finds from Lorehold dig sites in his room; he lost count of how many times he was sternly told. "History belongs to us all!‚Äô‚Äô So, naturally, he mastered the magical art of duplicative restoration. Not only can he perfectly recreate an ancient object or device from the smallest scrap, but he can also produce a second, identical version for his personal collection. He displays something different every week in his Lorehold office, from a mighty sword of demon-slaying to a delicate elven music box.
* **Losheel, Clockwork Scholar** (CG female loxodon Lorehold professor of chaos). She proudly admits that she is willing to work hard to be as lazy as possible. She turns her brilliant mind to constructing increasingly efficient mechanical helpers, with the goal of one day being able to do anything she wants without standing up.
* **Uvilda Mistcoiler, Dean of Perfection** (NG female genasi Prismari professor of perfection). A master of artistic technique, Uvilda trains with a range of elements whenever she isn‚Äôt focused on her teaching. She is known for giving students profoundly insightful feedback, which she tailors to each individual. After a review, she often offers a small piece of advice that alters the student‚Äôs point of view and work forever ‚Äî for the better. Uvilda believes that good art comes from the head. To her, carefully measured strokes and deliberate object placement make the difference between fully realized art and a total mess. If Dean Nassari interrupts her careful work with bombastic expressions one more time, Uvilda is prepared to enroll in Quandrix to learn how to shrink Nassari.
* **Nassari, Dean of Expression** (CG non-binary genasi Prismari professor of expression). Nazzari always wants to see art that is bigger, more radical in concept, and more emotionally powerful. For their final project as a mage-student, Nassari famously ‚Äúturned in‚Äù an earthquake, which almost destroyed three campus buildings. The piece received a standing ovation from the mage-student body ‚Äî and a grumpy thumbs down from the campus construction golems. Nassari believes that true expression comes from the heart. They encourage their students to treat the entire world as a canvas on which to spread emotion and excitement. Nassari takes little heed of Dean Mistcoiler's quiet masterpieces and often feigns forgetfulness about Dean Mistcoiler‚Äôs very existence.
- **Veyran, Voice of Duality** (CG female genasi Prismari professor of perfection). In addition to being an accomplished elementalist, Veyran serves as a mentor to many Prismari pledgemages. She advocates enthusiastically for the importance of both passion and disciplined technique in any artistic pursuit. If a new student is upset or overwhelmed, she eagerly calls forth playful, beautiful elemental creatures to cheer up the student.
- **Zaffai, Thunder Conductor** (CN male human Prismari professor of expression). As soon as Zaffai came of age, his parents sent him to Strixhaven, assuring him his budding musical genius deserved the finest instruction in the world. (In truth, though he did possess prodigious talent, they were also growing tired of their house being randomly struck by lightning or engulfed in cyclones whenever he practiced.) Even as he flourished as both mage and musician, he discovered a new aptitude: conducting. In addition to teaching, he serves as Grand Maestro of Strixhaven's Orchestra of the Arcane, an elite extracurricular activity for top Prismari students. They practice only outdoors, and their concerts fill the sky with beautiful explosions of elemental magic.
- **Arkin Minexes, Peppy Instructor** (LG male human Prismari professor of expression). Arkin is a newly hired instructor teaching a few courses in choreography and dance ensembles. He recently graduated from Strixhaven himself, and he bubbles with excitement at the prospect of guiding a new generation of students on the course of study he so greatly enjoyed. He particularly delights in finding new ways to help students work collaboratively to unlock the heights of their creative potential.
- **Kianne, Dean of Substance** (N female elf Quandrix professor of substance). Brilliant and eccentric, Dean Kianne is one of the pre-eminent mana scholars of the world. She has visited and studied countless bizarre magical phenomena, from snarls to star arches to ancient shrines. She loves to share her wild theories with anyone who will listen. Kianne believes in using mathematics to better understand nature. She places an emphasis on practical magic that improves daily life through applied calculations. She rolls her eyes at Dean Imbraham‚Äôs theories, dismissing them as evidence that her fellow dean lives in an imaginary world.
- **Imbraham, Dean of Theory** (N male owlin Quandrix professor of theory). Dean Imbraham is stern and shrewd, with a mind as piercing as his curved beak. He is known for the unnerving habit of fully rotating his head around to address his students, while still rapidly chalking up complex theorems and equations on a chalkboard. Imbraham loves numbers more than people or the out-of-doors; some say he hasn‚Äôt gone outside certain chambers of the Quandrix campus in years. Imbraham wants nothing more than to crack the mysteries of the world through dauntingly complex theories. He offers his students standing bounties on any of his unsolved equations.
- **Adrix and Nev, Twincasters**. The twins Adrix (NG triton Quandrix professor of substance) and Nev (NG triton Quandrix professor of theory) grew up literally swimming in magic, in an ocean region near a powerful magical snarl. At an early age, they began to see patterns in the tides and currents that eluded even the most esteemed scholars of their society. Once, they saved a hundred lives by predicting the sudden arrival of a tsunami, despite the deceptively calm seas ‚Äî washing away any doubts in their prowess. Adrix and Nev now teach as a duo, blending mastery of both of Quandrix‚Äôs philosophical perspectives. They constantly debate the merits of various esoteric mathematical principles, but if one of their students is in danger, they leap into action in perfect harmony.
- **Deekah, Fractal Theorist** (LN female human Quandrix professor of theory). Deekah sees the world as an endless sequence of interconnected equations, which to her is the most beautiful thing imaginable. She explores new theorems by giving them physical form, and her exquisite geometric creations are thrilling sights on campus.
- **Ruxa, Patient Professor** (NG male Quandrix professor of substance). Ruxa looks like a bipedal brown bear and knows that wild new theories, though exciting, are worth less without a deep understanding of the basics. He teaches students of all levels, and even his most experienced pupils benefit from a much deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the world.
- **Shaile Talonrook, Dean of Radiance** (LG female owlin Silverquill professor of radiance). Dean Shaile is a perennially optimistic orator. A master of literature, she often quotes obscure passages from famous texts. Her soul-filling advice and educated references have been known to make people literally glow. Shaile believes that all people have the potential for good and wishes to teach her students how to make the world a better place. She and Dean Lu often clash over Silverquill‚Äôs curriculum, but the balance found between them is far more eloquent than even their words can describe.
- **Embrose Lu, Dean of Shadow** (LN male human Silverquill professor of shadow). A master poet whose ink magic is merciless. Scant with praise and quick with a cutting remark, Dean Lu has seen many mage-students scrub out of Strixhaven and has nothing good to say about those who can‚Äôt hack it. A cynic, Embrose believes that most people are in it for themselves. He demands his students learn how to use language-based magic to ‚Äúget what they deserve.‚Äù While he often argues with Dean Talonrook, he holds a deep (if begrudging) respect for the owlin.
- **Breena, the Demagogue** (NG female owlin Silverquill professor of shadow). Breena has a talent for getting her way. If she wants you to do something, you won‚Äôt just do it ‚Äî you‚Äôll be sure it was your idea all along. Her students and colleagues alike hang on her every word, and in front of a crowd, she‚Äôs a powerhouse of charisma, enhancing her speeches with elegant swirls of ink magic. Though she‚Äôs an elite mage who can easily hold her own in a fight, Breena prefers to defeat her foes with words alone. An Oriq agent once trapped and attempted to recruit her, threatening her students‚Äô lives if she didn‚Äôt comply. Within an hour, she convinced him to free her, abandon his wicked ways, and seek wisdom from the archaics.
- **Nils, Discipline Enforcer** (LN male human Silverquill professor of radiance). Nils is an optimist, as he believes in every student‚Äôs potential for greatness. However, this outlook also means he‚Äôs constantly disappointed by their suboptimal choices, and he is well known for his strictness and abrupt scoldings.
- **Brenneth Blackstone, Scriptology Star** (NG male dhampir Silverquill professor of shadow). Brenneth is a rising star in the study of magical writing and symbols. With a dynamic lecturing style, this dhampir ‚Äî a partial vampire ‚Äî attracts students from across Strixhaven purely for his lessons‚Äô value as performance art. He teaches a course in scrivening and scriptology that characters take over the course of year 2.
- **Fain, the Broker** (N male human Silverquill professor of shadow). Lost an important textbook? Craving some rare delicacy from home? Need something inconveniently forbidden? Enter Fain. He has an extensive network of connections on and off campus, and he can procure just about anything ‚Äî so long as you can afford his price.
- **Lisette, Dean of the Root** (NG female human Witherbloom professor of growth). Dean Lissette is a world-class healer and herbalist; it‚Äôs even said she once cured the Lorehold founder dragon of a secret illness. Lisette‚Äôs classes lean more toward demonstration and hands-on experience than lectures. When Lisette speaks, her words are soft and full of colorful metaphors. Lisette believes in preserving nature and life, and she instills in her students a respect for all living things. While Dean Valentin‚Äôs exploitation of living creatures disgusts her, she also knows she can use the results of his cruelty to help future lives.
- **Valentin, Dean of the Vein** (N male vampire). Dean Valentin is ancient and drinks the blood of living creatures throughout the bayou. Valentin is a kind of sangromancer ‚Äî he receives visions from the blood he consumes, which he uses to learn things about a creature or place. He has no qualms about exploiting the bayou‚Äôs creatures for personal gain. Valentin's classes focus on dissection and decay. He and Dean Lisette often clash over his cavalier treatment of animals, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped her from using his discoveries for her research.
- **Willowdusk, Essence Seer** (NG female treant). No one knows how old Willowdusk really is. This professor of growth claims to be older than Strixhaven itself, and although many suspect that she exaggerates, no one else who has lived long enough to refute her cares to do so. Many years ago, a group of rebellious students got lost in Detention Bog and took shelter in what turned out to be Willowdusk‚Äôs roots. She protected them from a pack of hungry groffs and shepherded them back to Widdershins Hall, offering a lecture on proper herb-gathering practices during the journey. Her lessons proved so effective that she was asked to stay as a professor. She loves passing on her knowledge of medicinal herbs, pest mascot cultivation, and dissection techniques to generations of new students, and she almost always has a pot of tea brewing.
- **Tivash, Gloom Summoner** (N male human Witherbloom professor of decay). It‚Äôs tough to study the secrets of life and death without getting your hands dirty ‚Äî which is the first thing Tivash teaches Witherbloom students. Some call the forces he manipulates evil, but he asserts that power is only as good or evil as how you use it.
- **Verelda Lang, Arcano-Biologist** (CN female dryad). Verelda is a respected Witherbloom professor of growth who teaches introductory courses in magical physiologies, helping students in every college learn about the many unusual creatures they‚Äôre likely to encounter, whatever the students‚Äô field of study. Her research extends to the vital functions of fractal creatures and other artificial life-forms, leading her to teach courses at Quandrix College as well.
- **Yedora, Grave Gardener** (N female treant). Yedora is the head groundskeeper and unofficial undertaker of Strixhaven. Students and graduates often wish to spend their afterlife at their beloved university, and she honors that wish. Each tree she plants represents the essence of a fallen mage, and she remembers them all by name.
- **Gyome, Master Chef** (N male troll). Anyone who thinks a troll can't be a great chef has never met Gyome. He combines local ingredients with flavors from his homeland into an ever-changing menu of delicacies. Students from every college trek through Sedgemoor in droves for his food. The only complaint he ever receives is that he gives out unreasonably large portions.

### Locations

#### Central Campus
The central campus is the heart of Strixhaven. Its extensive grounds include residence halls for first-year students, dining halls, administration buildings, classrooms and laboratories (mostly used for first-year classes and interdisciplinary studies), and space for social gatherings.

##### The Biblioplex
The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university‚Äôs main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows
like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.

Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hall ways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.

Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolizing the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.

##### Archway Commons
Just south of the Biblioplex, a star arch curves over head like a smaller echo of the Dawnbow, and a lush park, Archway Commons, marks the site. More familiarly called the Commons, the park is a favorite spot for students ‚Äî especially first-years ‚Äî to gather in fair weather or to wander through on dates. Some of the university‚Äôs clubs also use the park to host social gatherings and games, including live-action roleplaying games and casual sports.

##### Firejolt Cafe
At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside the Biblioplex stands the cozy Firejolt Cafe, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The cafe‚Äôs name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for first-year students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.

##### Bow‚Äôs End Tavern
At the western end of the Dawnbow, where it meets the ground, stands a smaller university landmark: Bow‚Äôs End Tavern, which serves as a hangout for older students. Most patrons come for the live music, deliciously greasy food, and various potions and beverages. Others come to settle their differences in wild duels in the lot behind the tavern. The tavern‚Äôs manager is a kind but strict orc named Tulk ‚Äúthe Bulk‚Äù Tusktooth.

##### Strixhaven Stadium
The stadium where thousands gather to watch students play Mage Tower (and sometimes other sports) is located near Bow‚Äôs End Tavern.

#### Lorehold

Lorehold is the College of Archaeomancy ‚Äî a term that describes the exploration of ancient things through magic. Its mages explore the past by poring over archaeological sites, calling forth magical energy from old tomes, and summoning the spirits of long-dead historical figures. Lorehold mages travel far and wide across the world, gathering relics of bygone ages and learning dead languages to unpack the secrets of history.

Lorehold College is devoted to the study of history, broadly understood to include the various aspects of culture, behavior, and social relationships that shape historical events. Its studies include various subdivisions of history (military history, social history, cultural history), archaeology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, and economics. It overlaps with Prismari College in the field of art history, with some students splitting their studies between the two colleges. Lorehold mages use their magic to unearth secrets and share illumination.

Lorehold‚Äôs two deans carry the titles Dean of Order and Dean of Chaos, as order versus chaos encapsulates the fundamental conflict at the heart of Lorehold‚Äôs philosophy. This conflict revolves around the forces that underlie and drive history. Is the course of time driving toward a well-ordered ideal state or slowly devolving into chaos? Are deep patterns hidden in historical texts, or is time a series of coincidence and happenstance?
- The perspective of order emphasizes the structures that pull people together ‚Äî law, religion, economics, education, social class, and so on ‚Äî and how those structures drive historical events. Order focuses on systemic changes and the actions of people collectively.
- The perspective of chaos, by contrast, emphasizes individual actions, personal bonds of families and friends, and the disruptive force of lone, passionate people in history. Scholars of chaos gravitate toward reckless discovery and the spirit of adventure in their research of the past ‚Äî the essence and emotion of history over precision or procedure.

The Lorehold campus is located on the northwest of the central campus, in a region of stark vertical relief, near the Fang Crater. Rugged mesas and steep hills rise from a wide plain, and a great chasm holds the excavated ruins of an ancient settlement. Several star arches encircle rocky peaks and outcroppings, testifying to the powerful magical energy in the vicinity ‚Äî energy once harnessed by the ancients who used to inhabit this area.

##### Pillardrop
Part natural chasm, part archaeological excavation, and part new construction, Pillardrop is a series of buildings excavated out of cliffs on the Lorehold campus. Ruins and upgraded halls together are now used for research, classwork, and housing. Precarious bridges link one neighborhood of Pillardrop to another, often directly passing the enormous stone faces of old statues. Every Lorehold class has a story of some careless student making a misstep on one of these bridges or in some particularly crumbling section of the ruins, sometimes with disastrous consequences ‚Äî and sometimes finding deliverance when a spirit statue appears from no where to catch the hapless student before they suffer serious harm.

##### Effigy Row
The heart of the Lorehold campus surrounds a soaring bridge that crosses the chasm of Pillardrop. The bridge and surrounding pathways are lined with monuments depicting historic figures, including past professors and prominent mage-students, as well as war heroes and heads of state from ages past.

##### Kollema Hall
Kollema Hall is a grand, multitiered gallery built into a large outcrop at the end of Effigy Row. Here, Lorehold mages gather for large lectures. At the center of the hall towers a magnificent statue of Kollema, a wise monastic who was one of the first Lorehold professors.

#### Prismari

Prismari, the College of Elemental Arts, is devoted to the study and practice of art intertwined with magic. The mage-students of Prismari wield magic in spectacles of creativity: masterpieces of showy, over-the-top magic. They use elemental magic to express who they are and how they see the world, often combining different types of energy ‚Äî fire, water, air, earth, lightning, heat, cold ‚Äî in powerful expressions of conflict and harmony.

Prismari College is dedicated to the arts. Its scholars view art as the fundamental form of self-expression and magic as a tool, a medium, and an
inspiration. Prismari studies focus on visual arts (including architecture, painting, and sculpture) and performing arts (such as dance, music, and theater). The curriculum overlaps with Lorehold in the field of art history and with Silverquill in the literary arts, and some students divide their time between Prismari and one of those other schools to pursue these interdisciplinary fields. Prismari mages use magic to weave the elements into their creations; they might juxtapose fire alongside paint, ceramics, or fabric, or they might choreograph elaborate works that unite a dancer's movements with gusts and eddies of air.

Prismari's two deans carry the titles Dean of Perfection and Dean of Expression, and they often express the fundamental conflict of their philosophy
as perfection versus expression ‚Äî or, sometimes, as intellect versus emotion. What is the purpose of art? Is it to make people think things or make people feel things? Is it supposed to be carefully thought out or raw and spontaneous? Is mastery of art a matter of honing precise techniques to a point of perfection or of perfectly expressing a raw emotional state? Does art aspire to express universal truths or intensely personal ones?
- The perspective of perfection focuses on technique, analysis, theory, aesthetics, and universal principles. It embraces intellect over emotion, strives to be thought-provoking and reflective, and aspires to mastery. Its mages tend to use elemental forces of cold, water, and wind.
- The perspective of expression instead emphasizes the portrayal of personal emotional truths. Its mages value improvisation, innovation, and rule-breaking, and they often favor elemental magic using fire, lightning, and earth.

The Prismari campus is located on the southwest of the central campus, situated in a region of jagged rocks, rugged spires, and intense geothermal activity.

##### Conjurot Hall
The center of the Prismari campus is Conjurot Hall, a towering structure with a glassed-in observation area at the top. Constantly changing strands of elemental energy encircle the structure. Artist-mages can see for miles from Conjurot‚Äôs main turret, and the view has inspired many artistic creations.

##### Opus Walk
Hundreds of Prismari creations are displayed along a path that winds through the central campus buildings, giving the path its name: Opus Walk. Some famous pieces of magical art have been displayed along Opus Walk for centuries, while other transient bursts of creativity last only a few moments.

##### Furygale
At the outskirts of the Prismari campus, the abandoned creations of thousands of past artist-mages have coalesced over the years into the notorious region of Furygale. Roped off by magical wards and warning signs. Furygale is several acres of ever-changing magical energy, gales of ice and wind and fire, and elementals gone rogue. While dangerous, it also provides a source of wild inspiration, and it remains a popular spot for students who want to duel without being interrupted by faculty.

#### Quandrix

Quandrix is the College of Numeromancy ‚Äî a term that encompasses the study of patterns, fractals, and symmetries to wield power over the fundamental mathematics of nature. Quandrix mages can summon creatures made of fractals or turn abstract theories into towering, spiraling patterns. They love to expand and multiply; they can increase their knowledge or size by bending numbers. They dwell in the overlap between the theoretical and the natural ‚Äî from the fabric of their robes to the nature of their spells, they make use of repeated elements, clever symmetries, and surprising geometry to express the complex truths they study.

The studies undertaken within Quandrix College include mathematics, physics, logic, statistics, metaphysics, and various fields of theoretical magic. Students from the other colleges occasionally delve into Quandrix courses to bolster the theoretical underpinnings of their studies, and Quandrix‚Äôs studies of nature and Witherbloom‚Äôs explorations of practical biology have some significant overlap.

Quandrix‚Äôs two deans carry the titles Dean of Substance and Dean of Theory, reflecting the philosophical division within the college. Is mathematics a
natural force that exists in the universe independent of the constructs of intelligent minds, or is it a theoretical framework created by those who study it? Is the work of the scholar to discover what is or to define what could be?
- The perspective of substance emphasizes physical reality. In this view, math is embodied in the natural forces of the multiverse, waiting to be discovered by those with the intellectual fortitude to delve into those secrets. Quandrix mages who embrace this view use magic to bring numerical concepts to life, creating or altering physical reality out of mathematical possibility.
- The perspective of theory focuses on the abstract realms of conjecture and possibility. Its scholars view math as a lens through which a mind can understand the cosmos, not something that exists in dependently in the world. Mages who embrace this perspective use their spells to weave illusions and manipulate the fabric of magic itself.

Quandrix is located on the northeast of campus, situated in a coastal area surrounded by lush woodland and abundant rivers and streams.

##### Torus Hall
The central hall of Quandrix campus lies at the end of a geometric series of walkways, terminating at ascending ramps to the towering building. Inside, Torus Hall‚Äôs architecture is mapped to an ever-changing three-dimensional grid, which slowly evolves. Some Quandrix faculty members insist that mage-students shouldn‚Äôt linger too long inside the hall, lest its geometry eventually turn itself inside out while students are still within it.

##### The Arithmodrome
The Quandrix campus is alive with dynamic sculptures made of water behaving in odd ways: cube-shaped fountains, arching aqueducts that flow through the air, towers of solid-seeming water. One water structure holds a secret: a mysterious inner expanse called the Arithmodrome. From the outside, the Arithmodrome looks like a large cube of water, ten feet on each side. The inside is an apparently boundless theory-space that suspends the rules of reality. Mages use this space to explore theoretical numerical possibilities.

##### The Cultivarium
The Cultivarium is an eye-popping, sun-drenched garden of spiraling, cyclical plants and fractalized animals. Quandrix faculty members have repeatedly taught growth spells in this part of campus, and over the centuries, the area has come to intensify any growth magic cast within it.

#### Silverquill

Silverquill is the College of Eloquence, and its mages ‚Äî stylish, intimidating, and driven ‚Äî are masters of the magic of words. They create spells from spoken-word battle poetry or magical manifestations of the written word, scribing patterns of runic ink in the air. These mages make for natural leaders, fiercely competitive, with a piercing wit and a never-second-place attitude.

The curriculum of Silverquill College revolves around words, encompassing literature (including fiction, essays, drama, and poetry), languages, linguistics, oratory, rhetoric, and dramatic performance. Students from other colleges often take Silverquill courses to improve their communication
skills, learning to speak and write more effectively about their primary field of study. Silverquill and Prismari see overlap in the area of performing arts, with Silverquill emphasizing verbal performance and Prismari focusing more on dance and other forms of movement.

The two deans of Silverquill are called the Dean of Radiance and the Dean of Shadow, highlighting the college‚Äôs use of metaphor in describing its philosophical differences. The metaphor of radiance and shadow takes concrete form in Silverquill magic, as students learn to manifest brilliant light or inky darkness with their spells. The fundamental argument among Silverquill‚Äôs scholars centers on the purpose of communication. Is it to help others or further a personal agenda? Does literature selflessly better society or selfishly advance one‚Äôs own goals?
- The college‚Äôs perspective of radiance envisions language as sunlight emanating from the speaker or writer to illuminate others and make the world a brighter place. Mages who embrace this view use their language skills ‚Äî and their magic ‚Äî to uplift and empower others, to shine light on the evils of society, and to inspire the best in those around them.
- The college‚Äôs perspective of shadow focuses on the power of language to stab, to expose stinging truths, and to obfuscate secrets. The magic of shadow mages often manifests as bolts or blades of darkness or blotches of flowing ink, and its effects range from a sting of shame to an assault on the target‚Äôs life energy.

Silverquill is located on the north end of campus, on the border between the school and the Wyrmsfang Jungle. Silverquill is the most urban of the five colleges, with a campus that features buildings of stately elegance.

##### Grandloft Hall
The main Silverquill building is Grandloft Hall, a vast space with shafts of light streaking in from the enchanted windowpanes far above. Grandloft teems with balconies, loges, booths, daises, and other spaces where orators can perform their craft. Inklings, the college‚Äôs mascots, flit around the high ceiling, and enchanted spotlights automatically focus on any mage who uses powerful magic.

##### The Rose Stage
The Rose Stage is a rotating circular platform on the Silverquill campus. It has a backdrop of roses made of magical ink (tributes left by spectators of past performances), which creates excellent acoustics. Mage-students meet at the Rose Stage to practice performances, spar, or engage in honor duels. Faculty members often observe performances at the Rose Stage, coaching the students in their magical and rhetorical displays.

##### The Dramarium
The Dramarium is a facility where Silverquill students train in fitness, dance, martial arts, and other acts of physical performance. Students can avail
themselves of the preparation space called the Gray Room (actually a chain of rooms), which has hair and makeup salons, voice rehearsal booths, mirrored rehearsal spaces, and spa facilities. The back of the Dramarium has a special sensory deprivation chamber for mage-students who want complete silence in which to meditate.

#### Witherbloom

At Witherbloom, the College of Essence Studies, mages draw power from the opposing forces of life and death. These mages brew their spells from
natural components and the essence of living creatures, using that power to heal or harm the living or to raise or entreat the dead. They can cause entire forests to blossom out of nowhere or call down old curses that scourge flesh from bone. Some Witherbloom mages defend ecosystems from pollution. while others revel in the power of corruption. They‚Äôre at home riding zombie crocodiles down a languid river, picking herbs for a potion to treat a disease, brooding over a chorus of swamp frogs, or summoning fearsome avatars of nature.

The curriculum of Witherbloom College focuses on various sciences, revolving around the life sciences. Biology, ecology, botany, chemistry, and related sciences combine with the study and manipulation of the magical energy of the Positive Plane and the Negative Plane, the primal forces of life and death. Witherbloom‚Äôs curriculum shares some overlap with Quandrix‚Äôs analysis of the mathematical patterns in nature.

The two deans of Witherbloom are traditionally called the Dean of the Root and the Dean of the Vein. These titles are a somewhat abstract way of
framing the core division in the college‚Äôs philosophy: is growth or decay the driving force in nature?
- The philosophy of the root (growth) focuses on life and its irrepressible drive to thrive. This view celebrates the diversity and adaptability of life forms, from the tiniest cells to the most complex networks of living things. The growth philosophy asserts that the urge to survive and reproduce is the most essential principle in the cosmos. Mages who adopt this view wield positive energy and practice healing magic.
- The philosophy of the vein (decay) focuses on the inevitability of death and decay. Its traditional name comes from the prominence of vampires within the college, whose conceptions of draining life through the vein have long proven an important counterweight to the growth philosophy of Witherbloom. The decay philosophy sees life energy as a resource to be consumed, rather than a good to be nourished for its own sake. Mages who adopt this view wield negative energy and practice necromancy.

Witherbloom is located on the southeast of campus, tucked away in a wide bayou, and adjacent to a large bog (denoted by the green area on the map of Argonnessen on the eastern end of the Great Barrier).

##### Sedgemoor
Sedgemoor, the bayou area that encompasses the Witherbloom campus, is known for a range of swamp creatures: bats, crocodilian monsters, zombified animals, lumbering beasts called brackish trudges, and canine creatures called groffs. Sedgemoor is an excellent place to find pest mascots, herbs, spider silk, fungi, and other ingredients for potions and spells.

##### Widdershins Hall
The center of the Witherbloom campus is Widdershins Hall, a bog mansion that looks like it grew out of Sedgemoor itself. Widdershins is a network of interconnected wooden pods, with planked walkways leading out of it like tendrils. The hall has a cozy inner chamber where students gather for classwork.

##### Detention Bog
A stinking, thoroughly unpleasant marshland lies adjacent to Sedgemoor: the Detention Bog. Witherbloom faculty members send misbehaving students to this bog as punishment, but it‚Äôs also an excellent place to gather herbs for certain cures and curses.

#### Fang Crater

This pit is hundreds of miles across and punches deep into the earth. The stone rim is blackened and smooth, and volcanic gases rise from cracks and vents in the walls. The crater was caused by a planar incursion from Fernia, when forces from the Sea of Fire flooded into Argonnessen. The Light of Siberys repelled the assault, and the loredrakes sealed the rift. Still, a manifest zone to Fernia remains at the very center of the crater ‚Äî a pit of lava more than a mile wide.

An ancient, ruined observatory is set into the rim of the crater; this plays an important role in the studies of the Lorehold school.

#### Wyrmsfang Jungle

The Wyrmsfang Jungle to the north of the site is the ancestral home of the Owlin people, who have become a common sight at the University over the centuries.
