The former home of the Giants, and current home of the Drow. Mostly extreme biomes such as lust jungle, arid desert, and expansive tundra. The northern section of the continent contains the majority of settlements.

### Locations

* **[[Stormreach]]**. The only major city thatâ€™s accessible to outsiders, and represents all of the dragonmarked houses.
* **Throne Gate Ruins**. Rumored to be the remains of an ancient Giant city (see [[2-14. Shardjammer Finding a Siberys Shard]] adventure).
* **Fangs of Argarak**. The location for the White Plume Mountain adventure, should the adventurers choose to travel that far south.
* **Obsidian City**. A legendary ruined city of the giants in the jungles of Xen'drik, now housing a small population of Sulatar drow. It is located on the Skyfall Peninsula, midway between the city of Stormreach and the Titan's Teeth. Legends speak of a nearby cave which is said to house an ancient necromantic wyrm - rumored to be a remnant of the extinct Qabalrin faction of elves.
