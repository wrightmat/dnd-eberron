Syrania is a curiously empty plane. While the Immeasurable Market is always bustling, most of this traffic is comprised of creatures from other planes. Syrania’s other spires have comparatively few inhabitants — not so few that they feel desolate or barren, just enough so that it always feels slow and peaceful. There’s no need for people to perform menial tasks in Syrania, nor does this plane have manifestations to populate it; damaged structures gradually repair themselves, and litter and debris slowly dissolve.

The native inhabitants of Syrania are winged humanoid immortals, collectively referred to as angels, though they differ from those of other planes in some important ways. While they’re considered to be celestials, most angels of Syrania are neutral in alignment. They aren’t champions of justice or bringers of hope; rather, they’re observers and scholars, defined by their domain of study. The lesser immortals are simply referred to as angels, while the higher orders have titles — virtues, dominions, and thrones. These higher angels are bound to the contemplation of a particular concept, based on their domain, and devote their existence to contemplating and understanding it. Some believe that it’s through this contemplation that the concept continues to exist (though most inhabitants of other places — mortal and immortal alike — consider this to be highly unlikely). The appearance of Syranian angels is influenced by their domain, so the Dominion of Storms might be wreathed in lightning and have wings formed of storm clouds, while the Dominion of Trees could have bark for skin and moss for hair.

Unlike lesser angels and visitors to Syrania, virtues, dominions, and thrones are immune to the effects of Syrania’s Absolute Peace property, and are capable of taking aggressive action to defend Syrania, or when pursuing their domain — so a virtue of war could fight. However, they always try to find nonviolent or nonlethal solutions to threats.

##### Angels
Angels are the least of the immortals of Syrania. They have no names or domains and are generally interchangeable; they serve as scribes and guides, performing minor tasks. They do not engage in combat and their statistics are largely inconsequential.

##### Virtues
Virtues are a higher order of angel, with names and broad domains — Hazari, Virtue of Nature. They act as assistants and emissaries of the dominions. Virtues spend much of their time contemplating their domain, but they also gather information for their dominions — either by fetching existing records within Syrania, talking with creatures who visit the plane, or by venturing beyond Syrania and discretely observing. A dominion is always aware of everything that happens to its virtues and immediately knows all information they collect.

Virtues typically use the stat blocks of devas, and they change their forms to conceal their presence while gathering intelligence. They can only use commune to answer questions tied to their domain, and can cast plane shift once per day, but only when acting in the direct service of a dominion.

##### Dominions
Dominions focus on a very specific aspect of a single domain, like wolves or swords. They have names and specific domains, along with extra titles for pomp — Tezaria, Angel of the Storm, Dominion of the Seventh Spire. They typically spend their time in contemplation and use virtues as their eyes and hands, but occasionally a dominion acts directly — especially if its spire is threatened in some way. As neutral observers, dominions have no sympathy for mortals, but they’re often willing to discuss their domain with a mortal who has an interesting perspective on it.

It’s important to recognize the difference between a warrior angel of Shavarath and a dominion of Syrania with the domain of War. The Shavaran is an angel who fights wars, and this has no place in peaceful Syrania. On the other hand, the dominion of Syrania—perhaps called the Angel of Swords — understands war, and in particular, knows everything there is to know about a single thing: swords. They know sword-fighting techniques from every mortal and immortal culture. They can recognize any sword, know the locations of a number of long-forgotten legendary blades, and may have a few in their possession. They’re likely one of the deadliest swordfighters in existence, but they don’t actually desire to fight, because that’s not the point: they are the Angel of Swords, and they contemplate swords.

Dominions often use the statistics of a planetar, substituting the spells and skills with the appropriate Domain below; however, they maintain the ability to cast detect good and evil and invisibility at will, and use the latter to move unseen when observing on the Material Plane. Dominions might also possess additional abilities reflecting their absolute knowledge of their domain. For example, the Angel of Swords could be immune to any damage inflicted by a sword; perhaps they know perfectly how to defend against such an attack, or the sword itself might even refuse to strike them.

##### Thrones
The greatest angels of Syrania are the thrones. There’s a single throne for each domain, and they have a profound knowledge of their entire domain. Unlike lesser angels, thrones are known only by their domain, with no other name — the Throne of War. They’re bound to all the dominions whose studies lie within their domain, and they know everything experienced by those dominions. They largely remain in deep contemplation, acting only if Syrania itself is threatened or if a dominion succumbs to corruption.

A throne has powers equal to or greater than a solar, though when using spells such as commune, it can only answer questions tied to its domain. A throne also has access to the skills and spells of their domain. As a bonus action, a throne can strip the benefits of Syrania’s
Unburdened property for any number of creatures it can see — so flightless creatures who cause trouble may find themselves falling forever through the Open Sky. The thrones are the most powerful entities that can be encountered by mortals, but many sages assume that they are themselves tied to a greater force who knows everything that they experience, and who shapes the plane itself.

### Characters

* **[[Castiel]]** (NN male angel solar). Castiel is the leader of the Solar City in Syrania, essentially the mayor of the city and definitely the most powerful angel in the plane.
* **Vyrael** (NN male angel). The Ashen Sword, Eighth among the Burning Host of Syrania. Vyrael is stationed as the guardian of a permanent portal between Syrania and Sharn, the City of Towers.
* **Ashe** (NN female angel). The angelic barkeep Ashe offers warm drinks around the fireplace at First Hearth, from which the inn takes its name.
* **Mazalene** (NN female angel). The Dominion of Rumors, who studies under the College of Commerce at The University.
* **Akadi** (NN female angel). The Dominion of Wind, who studies under the Nursery of Nature at The University.
* **Sune** (NN female angel). The Dominion of Beauty, who studies under the Amphitheater of Art at The University.

### **Locations**

#### The Open Sky
The Open Sky is the vast blue expanse from which the Azure Sky takes its name. The clear, bright, sunless sky shows no signs of passing time; the moon Therendor can be seen, but it doesn’t move or have phases. Despite the Open Sky’s seemingly infinite space, it wraps around on itself, effectively making it a 300-mile sphere. So while it takes a significant time to travel between the farthest points, it is possible. There are no native threats in the Open Sky, and all visitors to Syrania have the ability to fly; the catch is knowing where to go, as there are hundreds of spires.

#### The Immeasurable Market
> You look out across a market that appears to never end, with stalls composed of everything from temporary stands and tents to permanent stone structures. You can see customers and merchants from across the planes, including the Material Plane. To one side, a slaadi haggles with a modron over the price of hippogriff eggs; to the other, a sly dao shows a Shavaran balor a selection of Fernia-forged blades. It’s said that anything you can imagine — and many things you can’t — can be found in the Immeasurable Market.

While most planes are isolated from others and it’s difficult to move from one plane to another, commerce and peaceful interaction are defining aspects of Syrania. Most planes have back doors that lead to the Immeasurable Market. The crystal spire in the Open Sky is merely a gateway leading to an open marketplace that extends as far as the eye can see. To one side, a slaadi haggles with a modron over the price of hippogriff eggs; to the other, a sly dao shows a Shavaran balor a selection of Fernia-forged blades. It’s said that anything you can imagine — and many things you can’t — can be found in the Immeasurable Market.

The Immeasurable Market includes customers and merchants from across the planes, including the Material Plane; there are a few back doors to the Market hidden on Eberron, and those who find them can make a healthy profit trading in exotic goods. It also includes a significant number of native immortals. Angels work as servers and porters, while virtues of commerce run small stands and shops. Dominions of commerce run the largest and most reliable businesses, while the Throne of Commerce monitors the entire Market and banishes troublemakers.

There are countless merchants in the Market. Most have temporary stands or tents, but there are a few permanent structures scattered about; the Last Resort is the most beloved watering hole in the planes. The Immeasurable Merchants table provides a few examples of merchants and shops adventurers could discover.

Violence is forbidden in the Market, and thieves and other criminals are generally deported to Daanvi for judgment and punishment. While merchants always try to get the best deal, when dealing with immortal customers, your reputation is everything. Beyond this, oaths made in the Market carry great weight, and can be enforced in the courts of Daanvi; in the Immeasurable Market, your word truly is your bond. This is important, because most of the merchants aren’t always interested in gold, and goods and services usually involve barter. Any deal, whether buying or selling, that a mortal makes with an immortal in the Immeasurable Market usually comes with an additional price in the favor of the immortal. The Immeasurable Currencies table gives a few examples of things that can be used in trade, but this is just a starting point; the DM should feel free to come up with other offers.

#### The University
> A group of various multi-colored crystal spires make up what’s known on Syrania simply as The University. Each spire seems clearly decorated in accordance with a domain of study, from a beautiful hanging garden to a vast open library. An open square with a celestial café make up the center of the space.

The pursuit of knowledge and education are things that flourish in times of peace. While most dominions are devoted to their own personal contemplation, the Throne of Knowledge maintains the University of Syrania, where chosen students can study an astonishing array of subjects with virtues of knowledge and the occasional guest dominion. The catch is that students need to be admitted... and there isn’t actually a process for applying. At the moment, the University only has twenty-one students, chosen from across the planes by roaming virtues.

For planar travelers who come to Syrania, the University is a good repository of general knowledge; if the scholarly virtues can’t help, they’ll likely know the way to a dominion that can. It’s also an unusual background for a player character; perhaps a Divine Soul sorcerer unlocked their powers at the University, or perhaps a warlock’s Celestial patron is their thesis advisor. And it’s a very exotic option for a university group patron.

Each virtue, dominion, and throne is dedicated to contemplation and mastery of a domain. Below are some example domains, along with skills and spells that any dominion or throne dedicated to it would likely have; virtues might also be able to cast a couple spells from their associated domain.

##### Celestial Café
This coffee shop, located near the Hall of Knowledge, is composed of tables that float among the clouds of the Azure Sky. Angel students can often be found studying and sipping beverages here. The café is technically managed by Solace, the Dominion of Hospitality, but he spends most of his time at the Market.

>[!info] Menu
> - Angelicano - Coffee diluted with water.
> - Cherubccino - A coffee drink with steamed milk and foam.
> - Spiritualatte - A coffee drink with steamed milk and frothed milk - available in a variety of flavors and either hot or iced.
> - The Sun's Glory - A citrusy cider that makes your eyes glow like an Aasimar.
> - Good Hearth's Brew - A hot spiced rum which is popular among students for the immediate feeling of warmth and calm that follows.

##### Lectuary of Life and Death
The yellow crystalline tower for the domain of Life and the indigo crystalline tower for the domain of Death are located right next to each other, and are treated almost as a single unit by the students and staff of The University. Here the dichotomy of life and death is discussed endlessly.

**Life Domain**. At will: cure wounds, spare the dying. 3/day: beacon of hope, death ward, greater restoration, revivify. 1/day: heal, mass cure wounds, raise dead. Skills: Medicine.

#### Solar City
> The city of the angels is composed of floating towers which have comparatively few inhabitants — not so few that they feel desolate or barren, just enough so that it always feels slow and peaceful. Crystal spires serving as homes can be seen bobbing around an enormous central fountain. A floating portal can barely be seen in the distance of the city, guarded by an angel.

The city of the angels is composed of floating towers and is ruled over by the most powerful type of angel known as a Solar. These towers have comparatively few inhabitants — not so few that they feel desolate or barren, just enough so that it always feels slow and peaceful.

A permanent gate to Sharn is present in Solar City as well, and it’s guarded by a group called The Burning Host. Vyrael, the Ashen Sword, Eighth among the Burning Host of Syrania, is stationed as the guardian of this portal.

#### Undercloud
>As you descend into the Undercloud, a dense, murky fog envelops you, muffling sounds and dimming the light to a perpetual twilight. The air is thick with the musty scent of age and forgotten secrets, tinged with the occasional sharp tang of ozone. Below you, small islands of earth and cloud drift lazily, each carrying relics and artifacts that whisper faintly of their origins across Eberron and beyond.

A rarely visited and gloomy region beneath the clouds where things that need to be forgotten for the sake of peace sometimes end up. All manner of artifacts and strange relics from across Eberron and all the planes are drifting through the sky here on their own little motes of earth or cloud, forgotten to all but a few. There might be interplanar travelers in the Immeasurable Market who've come in search of things hidden in Undercloud and need help retrieving them. It seems like easy money, but a lot of the things that have ended up there are potentially dangerous, and the angels may try to stop your party retrieving them — and they'll have to contend with whatever strange monsters have ended up trapped in Undercloud over the millennia.

#### Windmount
> A large mountain can be seen rising from a misty cloud, where the bottom of the mountain can't actually be seen. It rises to a misty peak obscured by swirling clouds, and you can see bird-like creatures flying all around it. This entire view is almost obscured by an impossibly large brewing storm that appears to be engulfing the entire area.

This area is the home of the Aarakocra, who follow a woman named Akadi. Akadi is the Dominion of Wind (under the Nursery of Nature) at The University, but has become corrupted in some way, and is now actively creating a magical storm around the floating mountain of Windmount.

### Universal Properties

Syrania encourages communication and negotiation, and grants all creatures the gift of flight. The Open Sky of Syrania is an endless void, and without flight, you could fall indefinitely; fortunately, all creatures find that they can move through the air just as naturally as walking.

**Unburdened**. A creature gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, unless it already has a flying speed greater than or equal to its walking speed, in which case that speed increases by 10 feet.

**Gentle Thoughts**. A creature has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

**Standard Time**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

**Universal Understanding**. A creature can understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that it hears and can understand any written language that it can see. This doesn’t decode secret messages or reveal the meaning of symbols that aren’t part of a written language.

**Absolute Peace**. To make an attack or cast a damaging spell, a creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it doesn’t make the attack or cast the spell, but the action is lost.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* When angels of Syrania become corrupted, they are cast out by their brethren, ripped of their wings and sent to the Material Plane. These angels are now Radiant Idols, and often serve the cause of evil.

| 1   | The Last Resort is a tavern where angels and devils drink together, where fey share stories while slaadi do shots. The barkeep Solace is the Dominion of Hospitality; he’s got a sympathetic ear for patrons and knows the perfect drink for any occasion.                                                                    | Commerce  |
| 2   | Jabra the night hag is an alchemist of exceptional skill. She bottles stolen dreams and nightmares, and sells unique potions with remarkable powers. She peddles her goods from an eye-catching tent of red dragonhide, and when she’s not in the Market, she can often be found selling her goods in Graywall.               | Invention |
| 3   | Sar Saeran the dao is the finest weaponsmith in Fernia. Sometimes he has goods for sale, but he also comes to the Market to discuss commissions.                                                                                                                                                                              | Forge     |
| 4   | Mazalene is the Dominion of Rumors, and she only trades in kind. Anyone who has a particularly interesting story to share with her can get an intriguing—and possibly true— tale from this angel.                                                                                                                             | Invention |
| 5   | The Hoard is the storefront of the ancient gold dragon Halazaryx, who settled in Syrania after some differences of opinion with the Conclave of Argonnessen. Hal has a collection of interesting relics tied to historical figures in Khorvaire, and is always interested in trading for items that have fascinating stories. | Commerce  |
| 6   | Lady Ash is a githyanki merchant who sells the plunder claimed by her city-ship, Zaeran’s Sword. Her goods depend on the Sword’s most recent target.                                                                                                                                                                          | Forge     |
| 7   | Bor’ob is a slaadi merchant specializing in extradimensional spaces: bags of holding, handy haversacks, and the like. He’s usually a gray slaad, but it varies from week to week.                                                                                                                                             | Commerce  |
| 8   | Slade is the Dominion of Art. They craft and play magical instruments, and may be willing to sell an instrument, a song, or a performance.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Invention |

| d8 | Immeasurable Currency |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Angel Tears. These translucent coins are one of the only active currencies in the Immeasurable Market. They’re produced by the Throne of Commerce and honored by most dominions and virtues. For simplicity’s sake, they could be assigned a value in gold pieces, so a Dominion might pay adventurers 100 gp in angel tears for a minor service. These are useful when you want to buy a drink at the tavern without selling your soul. |
| 2 | Dragonshards. Dragonshards are unique to Eberron, and there are merchants who take a great interest in them— especially Khyber dragonshards, which can be used to bind spirits. |
| 3 | Luck. Some merchants literally let you spend your fortune. Luck is measured in “dice.” Each die you spend allows the DM to give you disadvantage on a future d20 roll of their choosing. So if you spend five dice to acquire an item, that’s five difficult rolls in your future. |
| 4 | Trade Goods. Many merchants are primarily interested in things they can resell. What’s valuable to an immortal may not seem valuable to a mortal; an item that is unique or has emotional significance may have value to an Immeasurable merchant even if it doesn’t do anything. So it’s possible a treasured trinket holds more trade value than a legendary magic item. |
| 5 | Odd Organs. Some merchants like to deal in the body parts of unusual creatures— unicorn horns, a dragon’s heart, a demon’s eye. They may be willing to sell something on the promise of future delivery, but there’s usually a fixed time to complete the transaction. |
| 6 | Services. Merchants may well barter goods in exchange for a promise of service, either immediately or to be performed in the future. Remember that oaths sworn in the Market carry great weight; those who break a vow can end up facing a tribunal in Daanvi. |
| 7 | A Performance. There are merchants who trade goods in exchange for a performance of some sort. Usually this is about quality; they’ll sell you the dagger for a song, but it needs to be an epic performance. Can you succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Performance) check? |
| 8 | A Soul. These aren’t a common form of currency, but some immortals trade in souls... if not your own, this is usually about promising to kill someone! A soul traded in this way becomes the possession of the immortal upon death instead of it going to Dolurrh; this eliminates any possibility of resurrection unless the soul is reclaimed. |
