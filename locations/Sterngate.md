 #location #castle/fort [[Darguun]]

Sterngate is a fortress in Breland standing at the entrance to Marguul Pass and guarding the border against the goblin nation of Darguun. A lightning rail runs through Sterngate, connecting to Starilaskur to the north and Zolanberg to the south.

### Characters

- **Captain Toris**. The commanding officer of the fortress, and the effective head of the town.
- **Mirasandra (Miira) ir'Thavar**. Spends quite a bit of time here, as it’s the most fortified location on the border between Darguun and Breland. She doesn’t get along that well with Captain Toris though.
