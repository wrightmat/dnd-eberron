The second largest city in Valenar, Pylas Maradal is a port on the southern coast. House Lyrandar has invested in the city and built shipyards and a large house enclave. The port sees traffic from Q'barra, Sarlona, and Aerenal. When the region was part of Cyre, this city was known as Southport, a haven for smugglers and pirates.
