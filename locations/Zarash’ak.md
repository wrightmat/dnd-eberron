Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak, sometimes called the City of Stilts due to the supports that keep it above water. Known for its exotic cuisine and music, Zarash‚Äòak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the marshes. House Tharashk oversees the city, but clans and tribes often come here to sell crafts and other goods, or to celebrate religious rituals such as the Great Feast of Baaldra (Boldrei).

No lightning rail crosses the Shadow Marches, and House Orien won‚Äôt risk its caravans in the treacherous marshlands. No trade roads connect the scattered villages. For generations, the Marcher clans were virtually independent kingdoms, battling all challengers to maintain their dominions in the darkness.
 
This situation changed with the rise of House Tharashk and the demand for dragonshards. Galifar‚Äôs hunger for the mystic crystals was a source of wealth and influence for the heirs of Tharashk, provided they could process the crystals and move them to the markets of the east. The three dominant Tharashk clans were quick to establish refineries, but their ancestral homes were too deep in the Marches to facilitate easy trade with Galifar. The leaders of the clans came together to build the largest city the Marches had ever seen‚Äî a port that could carry shards and services to the wider world.
 
It proved impossible to erect a city on the shores of the Zarash Bay, so architects made their way up the Glum River until they found a region that was stable enough. Even then, building the port was no simple task. The Glum is unpredictable and prone to floods, and the only way to secure a foundation was to raise the city above the river. This style of building is common throughout the Marches, but no construction on this scale had ever heen attempted. The creation of Zarash'ak took a decade and the resources of all three great clans. The Torrn druids raised mighty murk oaks from the depths of the Glum. Aided by the brute strength of Aashta laborers, clever Velderan architects built a foundation of interlocking platforms using the trees as supports. Additional piles and pillars were dropped into the Glum, and in time Zarash'ak was born.
 
Today Zarash'ak is known across Khorvaire as the seat of House Tharashk and the gateway to the Shadow Marches. Those who wish to deal with the leadership of the House of Finding or venture into the depths of the Marches likely find their way to the City of Stilts.

No secure overland route to Zarash‚Äôak exists. In recent years House Lyrandar has established an airship docking tower in the City of Stilts, and airships remain the swiftest and safest way to reach Zarash‚Äôak. However, many captains refuse to risk their vessels in the skies of Droaam or the wild Marches. As a result, most visitors come to Zarash‚Äôak across the water, laying anchor in Zarash Bay and taking ferries up the Glum River. Typically, the journey costs 10 galifar per traveler, but no standards are enforced; ferry operators might charge more for wealthy passengers. The threat of Tharashk bounty hunters generally deters piracy along the Glum, but the river‚Äôs dangers include chuuls, mad cultists, and strange horrors of the daelkyr that have risen from the depths.

Rope ladders and lifts carry new arrivals from the Glum to the platforms of Zarash‚Äôak. Tharashk recently installed a single levitating lift for the heaviest loads, but most of the cranes and elevators are powered by orc muscle or ogre laborers from Droaam.
 
The primary docks are beneath the Heart, the original core of the city. Those who enter through the docks are evaluated by the Liondrake guards of House Tharashk. These minders care little for identification papers or nationality, but they have a good nose for visitors with trouble on their minds, and a person who offends the Liondrakes might be pushed off a platform into the river. The easiest way to avoid the scrutiny of the guards is to arrive in the company of a Tharashk heir who can dismiss them. Another option is to work with the heirs of Clan Orgaal, who bring goods into Zarash‚Äôak on the wings of wyverns. An Orgaal camp sits north of Zarash‚Äôak, and sufficient gold or other interesting offers can purchase a means of entry into the City of Stilts.

### Locations

#### The Heart

The Heart is the original center of the city, supported by the trunks of massive murk oaks. This area is dominated by the Tharashk enclave and its associated businesses and barracks. The dragonshard refineries are deeper in the Marches, but at any given time the vaults of the Heart hold a fortune in shards waiting to be shipped to the east. The enclave of Zarash‚Äôak is the home of the Tharashk triumvirate, which sets the overall vision for the house. It is also the seat of the Finder‚Äôs Guild, and many Tharashk heirs learn to harness their mystical gifts in the Heart of Zarash‚Äôak.

#### The Ring

The Ring surrounds the Heart and is constantly expanding. New levels are added to existing buildings, and new platforms are attached to the old. This work is done by different architects with wildly varying levels of skill, and the result is a ramshackle patchwork of a city. Some platforms have wide paths that could almost be considered roads; on and around other platforms, rope ladders are the only way to move from place to place. Most of the respected heirs of the house live in the Heart, leaving the Ring to traders, laborers, and travelers who can afford to stay out of the Webs. However, as the city‚Äôs population continues to grow, some members of the Tharashk clans are forced to settle in the Ring.
 
In general, the Ring is a bustling place. Merchants abound, offering everything from broiled slugs and handmade knives to healing salves and Gatekeeper charms. Beggars and thieves watch for unwary foreigners, and cultists of the Dragon Below take to the streets in search of new recruits. It‚Äôs a wild and chaotic environment, with opportunities for those seeking to make contact with Gatekeeper druids, followers of the Dragon Below, or guides to the deeper Marches.

### The Webs

The Webs stretch beneath the rest of the city, in the cramped space between the surface of the river and the lowest platforms of the Ring. The structures here are canopies supported by ropes anchored to the platforms above and the stilts. All of these structures are temporary by design, because when flooding is bad, the lowest canopies can be swept away. Here the poor and the mad mingle with those who enjoy the freedom of a hidden life in the shadows. If you know your way around, the Webs can be the fastest means of moving about Zarash‚Äôak, but running the ropes is dangerous for anyone who has poor balance or ene- mies in the deeps. The City of Stilts has no streets as such, and direc- tions are typically based on the names of buildings, the presence of certain people, or strong scents. For example, a traveler might be told to ‚Äúfollow the scent of the midden heap on the North Ring, and look for Torgaan‚Äôs black door.‚Äù
