Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak, sometimes called the City of Stilts due to the supports that keep it above water. Known for its exotic cuisine and music, Zarash‘ak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the marshes. House Tharashk oversees the city, but clans and tribes often come here to sell crafts and other goods, or to celebrate religious rituals such as the Great Feast of Baaldra (Boldrei).

No lightning rail crosses the Shadow Marches, and House Orien won’t risk its caravans in the treacherous marshlands. No trade roads connect the scattered villages. For generations, the Marcher clans were virtually independent kingdoms, battling all challengers to maintain their dominions in the darkness.
 
This situation changed with the rise of House Tharashk and the demand for dragonshards. Galifar’s hunger for the mystic crystals was a source of wealth and influence for the heirs of Tharashk, provided they could process the crystals and move them to the markets of the east. The three dominant Tharashk clans were quick to establish refineries, but their ancestral homes were too deep in the Marches to facilitate easy trade with Galifar. The leaders of the clans came together to build the largest city the Marches had ever seen — a port that could carry shards and services to the wider world.
 
It proved impossible to erect a city on the shores of the Zarash Bay, so architects made their way up the Glum River until they found a region that was stable enough. Even then, building the port was no simple task. The Glum is unpredictable and prone to floods, and the only way to secure a foundation was to raise the city above the river. This style of building is common throughout the Marches, but no construction on this scale had ever heen attempted. The creation of Zarash'ak took a decade and the resources of all three great clans. The Torrn druids raised mighty murk oaks from the depths of the Glum. Aided by the brute strength of Aashta laborers, clever Velderan architects built a foundation of interlocking platforms using the trees as supports. Additional piles and pillars were dropped into the Glum, and in time Zarash'ak was born.
 
Today Zarash'ak is known across Khorvaire as the seat of House Tharashk and the gateway to the Shadow Marches. Those who wish to deal with the leadership of the House of Finding or venture into the depths of the Marches likely find their way to the City of Stilts.

No secure overland route to Zarash’ak exists. In recent years House Lyrandar has established an airship docking tower in the City of Stilts, and airships remain the swiftest and safest way to reach Zarash’ak. However, many captains refuse to risk their vessels in the skies of Droaam or the wild Marches. As a result, most visitors come to Zarash’ak across the water, laying anchor in Zarash Bay and taking ferries up the Glum River. Typically, the journey costs 10 galifar per traveler, but no standards are enforced; ferry operators might charge more for wealthy passengers. The threat of Tharashk bounty hunters generally deters piracy along the Glum, but the river’s dangers include chuuls, mad cultists, and strange horrors of the daelkyr that have risen from the depths.

Rope ladders and lifts carry new arrivals from the Glum to the platforms of Zarash’ak. Tharashk recently installed a single levitating lift for the heaviest loads, but most of the cranes and elevators are powered by orc muscle or ogre laborers from Droaam.

Humans, orcs, and half-orcs make up the bulk of the population in Zarash’ak. A few hundred goblins live in the Webs, along with a number of gnomes, halflings, and half-elves. Traffic with Droaam has brought monstrous creatures to the city; ogres and gargoyles work across Zarash’ak, and each of the Tharashk triumvirs has a gorgon bodyguard. The Common tongue remains the standard language in the Heart, but many in the Ring and the Webs speak only Goblin. A significant number of resi- dents speak a language they call Azhani, a blend of the Old Common of Sarlona and Goblin. People who speak Riedran or Goblin can communicate with those who speak Azhani, but nuances can be lost. Traffic with the east has brought the coins of Galifar and Riedra to the city, and they are used interchangeably in Zarash ’ak. Some merchants prefer to barter for goods, and many citizens use raw dragonshard crystals as a form of currency.

#### Festivals

- **Calling the Light**: On the winter solstice, the shortest day of the day, a circle of twelve druids gather in a square in front of the Tharashk Enclave in the Heart to call back the sun. Eight of the druids are Tharashk heirs and four are Gatekeeper initiates. They mark their faces to indicate the twelve moons and spend the day chanting and meditating together from dawn to dusk. Other citizens of Zarash'ak may spend time during the day meditating, or they may fast to cleanse themselves. Others come to watch the druids and marvel at their decorations and disciplines, but everyone in the city can feel the solemn mood of the day. Some visitors familiar with druidic ritual have commented that the practice resembles a ritual of sealing, but it's unclear what they would be trying to keep sealed.
- **Rekh'aarvash**: The "Night of Masks" on Lharvion 14 is the most chaotic day to be in Zarash'ak, and that's saying something. The city puts on masks of lacquered wood, carved bone, sunbaked clay, hammered metal, or any of a thousand other materials and celebrates their city with food and drink. The celebration was originally created by House Tharashk as a way for the entire clan to celebrate together, removing the influence of wealth or station by including masks. Even race is obscured, allowing humans, orcs, and half-orcs to celebrate as one extended clan. In modern times, this celebration continues but is not universally appreciated. The masks may disguise the differences between a house-tharashk Tharashk half-orc and a Gatekeeper tribesman, but the other races of Zarash'ak still stick out. Minotaur mercenaries, harpy bodyguards, and goblin laborers all still stand out behind their masks and the racial prejudices which exist normally do not disappear just for Rekh'aarvash.

### Characters

- **Maagrim Torrn d'Tharashk** (NN female half-orc druid). Heir of Siberys and one of the three triumvirs who make up the ruling council of House Tharashk, the Triumvirate.
- **Lord Toka Threefangs** (male half-orc?). The ambassador of the Droaam warlord Kethelrax the Cunning. Threefangs is gaining influence among the goblins of the Webs with his tales of the kobold king, and some among the Liondrakes wonder how he plans to use his growing clout.
- **Jhugaar** (male goblin). In the Webs, he preaches raving sermons promising the rise of the Overlord known as the Voice in the Darkness. If true, this prophecy could draw the Lords of Dust to Zarash’ak (though, of course, it could be madness).

### Locations

#### The Heart

The Heart is the original center of the city, supported by the trunks of massive murk oaks. This area is dominated by the Tharashk enclave and its associated businesses and barracks. The dragonshard refineries are deeper in the Marches, but at any given time the vaults of the Heart hold a fortune in shards waiting to be shipped to the east. The enclave of Zarash’ak is the home of the Tharashk triumvirate, which sets the overall vision for the house. It is also the seat of the Finder’s Guild, and many Tharashk heirs learn to harness their mystical gifts in the Heart of Zarash’ak.

- **Docks**. The primary docks are beneath the Heart, the original core of the city. Those who enter through the docks are evaluated by the Liondrake guards of House Tharashk. These minders care little for identification papers or nationality, but they have a good nose for visitors with trouble on their minds, and a person who offends the Liondrakes might be pushed off a platform into the river. The easiest way to avoid the scrutiny of the guards is to arrive in the company of a Tharashk heir who can dismiss them. Another option is to work with the heirs of Clan Orgaal, who bring goods into Zarash’ak on the wings of wyverns. An Orgaal camp sits north of Zarash’ak, and sufficient gold or other interesting offers can purchase a means of entry into the City of Stilts.
- **Tharashk Enclave**. 
- **Dragonshard Refineries**. 
- **Finder’s Guild Headquarters**. 
- **Dark Six Temple**.
- **Sivis Message Station**. 
- **Lyrandar Tower**. 
- **Gold Dragon Inn**. 

#### The Ring

The Ring surrounds the Heart and is constantly expanding. New levels are added to existing buildings, and new platforms are attached to the old. This work is done by different architects with wildly varying levels of skill, and the result is a ramshackle patchwork of a city. Some platforms have wide paths that could almost be considered roads; on and around other platforms, rope ladders are the only way to move from place to place. Most of the respected heirs of the house live in the Heart, leaving the Ring to traders, laborers, and travelers who can afford to stay out of the Webs. However, as the city’s population continues to grow, some members of the Tharashk clans are forced to settle in the Ring.
 
In general, the Ring is a bustling place. Merchants abound, offering everything from broiled slugs and handmade knives to healing salves and Gatekeeper charms. Beggars and thieves watch for unwary foreigners, and cultists of the Dragon Below take to the streets in search of new recruits. It’s a wild and chaotic environment, with opportunities for those seeking to make contact with Gatekeeper druids, followers of the Dragon Below, or guides to the deeper Marches.

#### The Webs

The Webs stretch beneath the rest of the city, in the cramped space between the surface of the river and the lowest platforms of the Ring. The structures here are canopies supported by ropes anchored to the platforms above and the stilts. All of these structures are temporary by design, because when flooding is bad, the lowest canopies can be swept away. Here the poor and the mad mingle with those who enjoy the freedom of a hidden life in the shadows. If you know your way around, the Webs can be the fastest means of moving about Zarash’ak, but running the ropes is dangerous for anyone who has poor balance or ene- mies in the deeps. The City of Stilts has no streets as such, and directions are typically based on the names of buildings, the presence of certain people, or strong scents. For example, a traveler might be told to “follow the scent of the midden heap on the North Ring, and look for Torgaan’s black door.”
