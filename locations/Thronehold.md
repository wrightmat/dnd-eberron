Thronehold was built by Galifar I as his seat of power within the kingdom, located on an island in the center of the Scions Sound. The island, with the eponymous castle, was established by Galifar I to avoid having the capital within one of his existing realms. It is a place of international intrigue, divided into four districts that are each controlled by one of the surviving Five Nations.

A small port town was built on the shoreline in the shadow of the castle, able to provide staff and services that the seat of power would require. During the course of the Last War, after the rejection of the line of succession, the island and castle were protected by a detachment of House Deneith known as the "Throne Wardens", who continue to protect the battlements to this day.

By 975 YK, the port had developed into a small city, eventually taking its most recent role in history as the locale where the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, cementing the city's present appearance. Intended to be neutral ground, many spies and double agents are still hosted within. The castle of Thronehold itself is closed to the public for the time being.

 - [ ]  The gold dragons, and others in Thronehold who they have influenced, claim that the Treaty of Thronehold should not apply to Thrane, since it does not swear fealty to the Galifar line. For this reason, the gold dragons have the right to claim Thronehold as their own, even though the treaty declares it as neutral.

### History



### DM Notes
