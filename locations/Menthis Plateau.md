 #location #district [[Sharn]]

The Menthis Plateau is the hub of Sharn’s entertainment industry, as well as its most diverse ethnic quarter and the seat of Morgrave University. Its districts include Den’iyas (also called Little Zilargo because of its large gnome population), Everbright (the city’s only magic district), and two theater districts, Torchfire and Smoky Towers. Like the Central Plateau, its location allows it to draw visitors from all over the city to sample its entertainment offerings, and it also draws tourists from across the Five Nations.

### Locations

#### Lower Menthis Plateau

Character: Rowdy entertainment district.

The lower ward of Menthis Plateau perhaps best meets the stereotype of a metropolitan entertainment district. Its streets are crowded night and day, its buildings huddle dark and close together, and its offerings are lurid and often risqué. The only exceptions are the two residential districts, which are comparatively quiet places that give the City Watch little trouble.

##### Center Bridge (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this district.

Center Bridge tries to be a quiet residential district, but with Torchfire and Firelight on one side and Downstairs on the other it can’t help but smolder with seedy activity. Its residents include a number of people associated with Morgrave University, since it is located directly below the University District and it offers much cheaper housing than can be found in the ward above. In fact, groups of students share inexpensive housing here, so close to the illicit pleasures of Lower Menthis, and are responsible for much of the rowdiness that sometimes disturbs the peace of Center Bridge.

##### Downstairs (Tavern district)

> By night, inebriated revelers stumble forth into the crowded streets from dozens of taverns. By day, this district is a virtual ghost town, with only cleaning crews, delivery personnel, and the occasional determined drunk livening up the scene.

Situated on the western end of the plateau, separated from Torchfire and Firelight by the residential neighborhood of Center Bridge, Downstairs is nevertheless a rowdy district. Most of its businesses are taverns rather than fine restaurants (though there are exceptions), and drunken revels are the norm every night. Carousers finished with an evening at the theater in Torchfire or even the upper wards, or fresh from different kinds of activities in Firelight, come Downstairs to cap off the night.

- **Diamond Theater**: The Diamond Theater is something new in Lower Menthis — competition for the Ten Torches Theater in Torchfire. With its large stage, copious seating (it seats 1,000 comfortably), and renowned artist-in-residence, the Diamond manages to exude an air of sophistication ina ward all about base entertainment. Luca Syara, the Diamond’s resident playwright, is the hottest thing going in Sharn’s entertainment world at present. Many of her plays wrestle seriously with issues raised by the Last War, exploring themes of nationalism, shattered idealism, alienation and grief, and the search for meaning in a war-ravaged world. For many, such serious, modern plays hold no interest and draw nothing but derision, but even those who hate her still talk about her. Her contract with the Diamond expires in another year, and certain circles buzz constantly with speculation about what upper-ward theater will snatch her up at that point.
- **Four Sails**: The Four Sails restaurant is the exception to the general rule of Downstairs that drink comes first, food second. Known as one of Sharn’s hidden dining treasures, regular patrons of Four Sails claim that it has the best seafood in Sharn. Located at the base of Seventh Tower, Four Sails is owned by a Lhazaarite named Ulfen Marcrot (N male human barbarian 3/rogue 1), who certainly knows his seafood. Though he prefers not to discuss his past with the tourists and slumming upper-ward residents who come to Four Sails for the dining experience, Ulfen has a colorful history he does enjoy sharing with adventurers. Born and raised a pirate in the Lhazaar Principalities, he took up an adventuring career later in life and has even explored Argonnessen’s coast.

##### Firelight (Red light district)

> Noisy crowds fill taverns, casinos, and bordellos, the sound of laughter spilling out onto the dark streets. A great deal seems to be going on that appears illegal, but everyone seems to be having a good time.

The Firelight district caters to clients seeking entertainment of an intimate nature, as well as hardcore and casual gamblers. While Sharn’s other red-light districts, Sharn’s Welcome and Dragoneyes, are dangerous and disreputable places most respectable citizens wouldn't dream of visiting, Firelight has somehow managed to maintain a reputation as a socially acceptable place to come and have fun, whatever type of fun one might be interested in having. Crime is much better controlled in Firelight than in the other red-light districts, so customers are less likely to become victims. Changelings control most of the bordellos here, as they do in Dragoneyes, but they employ members of almost all races.

- **The Burning Ring**: The Burning Ring is not a specific location in Firelight. It moves frequently as the City Watch keeps trying to shut it down, but it seems to find a place to operate every night. It offers blood sport, gladiator-style combat conducted by amateur and professional warriors. The combat is real — the combatants use a variety of weapons but wear no armor—and sometimes matches end in death. Ideally, the healer on hand for every fight reaches a fallen combatant before he dies, but sometimes the fallen are beyond help. Death only seems to make the crowds cheer louder. The ringmaster is Hoas Junter (NE male shifter fighter 7), who has extensive connections to the Daask gang. Sometimes his connections help him bring in a monster as a combatant to the crowd’s utter delight. The monster usually wins.
- **Lucky Nines**: The Lucky Nines casino uses a remarkable amount of magic in the decoration and operation of the business. The owner, Fasha Yask (N female human wizard 8), employs a full staff of spellcasters — wizards, sorcerers, bards, artificers, and magewrights—to keep the place running smoothly. Unseen servants attend to customers’ needs, continual flame spells give illumination, illusions provide glamour and glitter, and bouncers with detect thoughts and detect magic patrol the floor to catch those who would cheat the establishment. In addition, as many would-be thieves have discovered, a variety of magic wards protect the place after hours, from fire traps to guards and wards.
- **Savia’s**: The most elegant bordello in Firelight claims that its clientele comes from Upper Central and Skyway as well as closer districts. Its real claim to fame, however, is that its owner, Savia Potellas (NE female human expert 2/bard 1), is Lower Menthis’s representative on Sharn’s city council. Her election outraged many of her fellow council members, but she claims to fairly represent the interests of the businesses in her ward, and the merchants of Lower Menthis have never complained about her leadership.

##### Forgelight Towers (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets and couples stroll arm in arm.

Forgelight Towers mostly succeeds where Center Bridge fails in being a relatively quiet residential neighborhood amid the rowdy chaos of Lower Menthis. A number of older citizens live in Forgelight Towers, long-time homeowners who established their residence here before the ward became quite so seedy. Many of them are fond of complaining how far downhill the neighborhood has gone; others are more interested in sampling the wares in Downstairs and Torchfire.

##### Torchfire (Theater district)

> Noisy crowds press into crowded theaters, and the sounds of bawdy music and roaring audiences fill the streets.

Torchfire is the most notorious district in Menthis, though its offerings are relatively tame compared to those of Firelight. Its theaters, particularly the Ten Torches, are known for racy musical comedy designed to appeal to rowdy audiences.

- **Gailan’s**: Every rule has its exception, and Torchfire’s reputation for low-brow entertainment is broken by Gailan’s. The model of the restaurant and dinner theater (copied extensively in Middle Menthis particularly) originated with the innovation of Gailan Uthran (N male half-orc expert As who felt he could put on better shows if the audiences had something to do besides heckle the performers. His idea has clearly worked, and performing in Gailan’s is now the dream of every chorus member in Ten Torches — the first step toward a successful musical career.
- **Ten Torches Theater**: The namesake of the Torchfire district is this crowded, smoke-filled theater near the point where Torchfire, Firelight, and Center Bridge converge. Though critically derided as the bottom of the barrel in Sharn’s entertainment scene, crowds fill its hall to bursting every night, thanks to a winning combination of cheap tickets and undeniably entertaining shows. It is sometimes hard to hear the performers over the roaring crowd, but no one seems to care — except perhaps the performers, or the young playwrights with aspirations of writing for the Grand Stage.

#### Middle Menthis Plateau

Character: Racially, ethnically, and economically diverse downtown area.

Middle Menthis is quite possibly Sharn’s most diverse ward, representing a true melting pot of different races, ethnic and national origins, economic classes, and social statuses. Small communities of human immigrants from the Lhazaar Principalities (in Warden Towers), the Shadow Marches (in Cassan Bridge), and Cyre (in Smoky Towers), in addition to the large halfling community in Little Plains and the students of Morgrave University, drawn from across Khorvaire, contribute to this diversity. Together, these many communities of immigrants make Middle Menthis an excellent place to find crafts and services that are particular to certain peoples and nations.

##### Cassan Bridge (Shops)

> Citizens rush by with their arms full of packages in this shop district. There is a definite foreign element to some of the architecture and the goods for sale, not to mention the people.

Cassan Bridge is a fairly unremarkable shopping district, unique only in the small community of human immigrants from the Shadow Marches who make their homes and livings here. Several importers bring Marcher crafts into Sharn, and specialty groceries carry ingredients favored in Marcher cooking. Although no buildings need be built on stilts in Middle Menthis, some of the architecture of Cassan Bridge echoes the styles of the Marches as well.

##### Everbright (Magic district)

> Everbright lanterns keep the towers here well illuminated, and other magical effects are visible everywhere—from soarsleds carrying people through the air to constructs following their masters as they visit different shops

Everbright might not be home to the majority of Sharn’s magic item dealers and spellcasters for hire, but it certainly can boast the largest concentration of them in any one district. While magic item dealers in the Central Plateau cater to wealthy collectors, those in Everbright tend to keep a more practical focus, selling items to the people who are most likely to actually use them — adventurers. For this reason, dealers in Everbright are far more willing to buy (and likely to sell) items that are not fully charged or are otherwise partially used up. Similarly, Everbright is the best place to find spellcasters for hire who are 10th level or above — whose talents are rare and in significant demand in Sharn.
While the spellcasters and dealers of Everbright are accustomed to trading with adventurers, they are also (for the most part) law-abiding citizens. Characters who need spells cast with no questions asked are better advised to seek out spellcasters affiliated with Sharn’s criminal gangs rather than walking into a spellcaster’s office in Everbright.

* **Shrine of the Shadow**: Hidden down a dark alley, the shrine of The Shadow represents the dark side of Everbright. Here, necromancers and other evil wizards gather in secret to revere the power of magic perverted to evil ends, led by a cleric/necromancer named Thalanna (CE female human cleric 3/necromancer 3). This secretive cult has no grand evil schemes for world domination; they exist purely to worship their patron deity and hide only to escape persecution.

##### Little Plains (Halfling encampment)

> The towers here appear insideout: instead of open central spaces surrounded by buildings attached to the outside of a tower, streets run around the outsides of the towers, giving access to very low doorways leading to cavelike interiors. Halflings seem to negotiate these outside ledges with ease, and so do the dinosaurs many of them ride. Great winged reptiles soar between towers, many with halfling riders on their backs.

Little Plains is not the only halfling neighborhood in Sharn, but it is the only district almost entirely inhabited by halflings and the only significant concentration west of the Mournland of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Even the architecture suggests the maintenance of these halflings’ traditional ways, since the towers resemble the city of Gatherhold in Talenta. More urbanized halflings live in Little Plains as well, as do some few members of other races (primarily gnomes and some kobolds).

##### Smoky Towers (Theater district)

> Theaters, restaurants, and concert halls offer the promise of an evening’s musical entertainment in this district.

Smoky Towers is in some ways an extension of the Torchlight district directly below it, perhaps slightly better off in general but not much different in essentials. Smoky Towers is the entertainment district of Middle Menthis, known for dinner theaters, recital halls, and one grand theater. It presents a grade of entertainment that falls between the burlesque of Torchlight and the classical drama of the University District—affordable yet respectable, accessible yet thoughtful.

A small but significant number of people who trace their origin to Cyre have made their home in Smoky Towers. Although culturally they differ little from their Brelish neighbors, this community has become very active in the wake of Cyre’s destruction, discussing rebuilding or reestablishing the nation elsewhere in Khorvaire. The Citadel keeps the Cyran community here under close watch due to this potentially treasonous talk.

- **The Atrium**: The Atrium, a recital hall in Kashik Tower, features an acoustically resonant open performance space with seating for about 300. For performers on the move in Menthis’s entertainment scene, the Atrium is a definite step up from most of the dinner theaters in the district, and many of its performers are only a few years away from being ready for the Kavarrah Concert Hall.
- **Classic Theater**: The only major theater in Middle Menthis, the Classic lives up to its name by performing only traditional works written before the start of the Last War. While the Grand Stage in the University District also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works. Every performance in the Classic features archaic language, outmoded social customs, and the idealistic outlook of a world that has utterly vanished from Khorvaire, yet its thousand seats fill up every night.
- **Mizano Rupa’s:** Mizano Rupa’s is one of three important dinner theater venues in Smoky Towers that give rising stars a stop on their ascent between Gailan’s and Upper Menthis. Self-consciously named and styled in imitation of Gailan’s in the Torchfire district below, Rupa’s offers decent food and high quality entertainment in a variety of styles. Mizano Rupa (N male dwarf expert 3) is hardly a connoisseur of fine music, but he knows what he likes and — fortunately — his tastes seem to compare with those of many in Middle Menthis, making his establishment quite popular. Reservations are recommended.
- **Starfire Dragon**: The Starfire Dragon offers a steady diet of entertainment accompanied by exquisite meals. In this case, however, the entertainment clearly takes a back seat to the food. Trying to compete in a crowded market, the Starfire Dragon's owner, Amman Todav (NG male human warrior 2/fighter 2), has hired excellent cooks, and the restaurant's menu offerings reflect the trouble he has gone to. Todav’s choice in entertainers is less discriminating, however; he lost a good portion of his hearing fighting in the Last War, and judges performers more on their looks than the quality of their performances. Onma good night, the entertainment ranks with the best Middle Menthis has to offer. But the Starfire Dragon is gaining a reputation for showcasing a great number of beautiful women with mediocre singing voices.
- **Thovanic Hall**: Similar to the Atrium, Thovanic Hall is a former theater converted to use as a recital hall. It is still very new (the renovation was completed only two years ago), and is still trying to build its reputation as a place for fine music to compete with the Atrium. As a distinguishing point, Thovanic presents a significant number of non-Brelish and even non-human performers, who bring diversity to the musical offerings that the residents of Middle Menthis find sorely lacking in the district’s other offerings.

##### Warden Towers (Garrison)

> Some guards of the Watch march to and fro in groups, while others stand at attention, and still others drill for combat. Shouted commands and marching songs fill the air.

Warden Towers is the home of Menthis Plateau’s Watch garrison, which includes 450 guards responsible for keeping order in the whole plateau. It also houses a small community of Lhazaar immigrants, many of whom have joined the Watch. This community also spills into Forgelight Towers and Downstairs, both in Lower Menthis.

- **Thuranne d’Velderan’s Investigative Services**: Thuranne d’ Velderan (NG half-ore rogue 5/dragonmark heir 1), ascion of House Tharashk, operates an inquisitive agency in Warden Towers. Her greatest asset is an extensive network of contacts within the Warden Towers garrison, which gives her access to resources beyond the reach of most inquisitives. She specializes in criminal investigation, and frequently consults for the Watch to repay the many favors her contacts have performed for her. She is not particularly favored in House Tharashk, since she prefers to run her own business than take on jobs for the house.

#### Upper Menthis Plateau

Character: Wealthy and educated, strongly influenced by the presence of Morgrave University.

Morgrave University might not be the most prestigious university in the Five Nations, but it is the largest educational institution in Sharn. The University strongly influences the character of the Upper Menthis ward, drawing academics, scribes, sages, and students from all over Breland and beyond. A diverse mix of races and national origins populate Upper Menthis. In addition to the University, Upper Menthis’s role as the crown of Sharn’s entertainment quarter has made a significant impact on the character of the ward, and four major theaters have been established here.

##### Den’iyas (Gnome neighborhood)

> The buildings here, from quiet and neat little townhomes to shops and services of all kinds, are scaled for the district's gnome inhabitants.

Den’iyas is known as the gnome neighborhood of Sharn, though barely ten percent of the city’s gnome population lives in this district. Few people of other races call it home, and its gnome residents cleave to their traditional customs unlike their more integrated brethren in the rest of the city. There are usually a dozen subtle power struggles going on between the major families of Den’iyas, and even the most innocuous event could be part of some elaborate intrigue. Information of all types can be acquired here, but those with secrets must be careful around the inquisitive gnomes, lest they become the object of blackmail, curiosity, or deceit.

- **Davandi Fine Tailoring**: The Upper Menthis representative on the city council is Thurik Davandi (LN male gnome expert 4/magewright 4), an accomplished tailor specializing in glamerweave garments. He also secretly supplies darkweave clothing to the Boromar Clan, and his goods are at least partly to blame for the City Watch’s inability to put a damper on the Boromar Clan’s criminal activities.
- **Khavish Theater**: The Khavish Theater, one of four upscale theaters in Upper Menthis (the other three are all located in the University District), stands out for its ability to cater to the needs of gnomes and gnome-sized races, with ample seating for people of Small and Medium size. Two stage troupes share the theater — the Khavish Players, made up mostly of human actors, and the Zilargo Repertoire Group, consisting entirely of gnome performers. The Khavish Players present more contemporary and widely appealing acts than the performers at the other Upper Menthis theaters, incorporating music, sex, and comedy — though not to the extent of the burlesque found in Lower Menthis. The Zilargo Repertoire Group generally performs works that only interest gnomes, full of intricate histories and a level of detail that audiences of other races find excessive (and mostly boring). Occasionally, they stage a comedy aimed at mixed-race audiences, generally featuring acrobatics and pratfalls. Recently, the famous gnome bard Kessler agreed to play with the Zilargo Repertoire Group, and that has brought more mixed crowds to their performances.

##### Ivy Towers (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets and couples stroll arm in arm.

Ivy Towers is a generally unremarkable residential district, notable only because a significant number of professors at Morgrave University make their homes here.

##### Platinate (Wealthy residential)

> The townhomes in this district are large and well kept, clearly displaying the wealth of their occupants. Servants move about on the business of their employers, and guards can be seen posted at many of the doors.

Platinate, among Sharn’s most desirable residential districts, isn’t as exclusive as Mithral Tower in Upper Central, but certainly compares to Oak Towers and Crystal Bridge in Upper Northedge. Morgrave University produces few scholars wealthy enough to live in Platinate, but some retired explorers who struck it rich selling artifacts from Xen’drik settled in this district to remain close to the University. There are just enough eccentric collectors of antiquities and retired adventurers to give Platinate a quirky character that distinguishes it from similar districts.

##### Seventh Tower (Fine shops)

> Stores, restaurants, hotels, and a few townhomes in this prosperous neighborhood appear high-priced and lavish.

Named for its most prominent architectural feature, Seventh Tower holds the distinction of being the finest shopping district in Menthis Plateau. A number of rare book dealers and antiquities shops set it apart from similar districts, such as Platinum Heights in Upper Central.

- **Galdin’s Garden**: By general consensus, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn is Galdin’s Garden. An elegant setting for a fine meal situated at the top of Seventh Tower, a garden of exotic and fragrant flowers, particularly roses and orchids, surrounds the establishment. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available, and some of the tables offer views of the distant ocean to the south on (the relatively rare) clear days. The menu consists of spicy Brelish offerings, while the wine list includes the best vintages from the Eldeen Reaches and Aundair.
- **Little Xen’drik**: The top level of Thurias Tower gained the appellation of Little Xen’drik because of the six antiquities dealers there. The dealers maintain a tremendous rivalry, each sponsoring expeditions to Xen’drik and offering the finest gold of the realm for items brought back from that far-away land.
	* Jaster Mekdall (N male elf expert 3/wizard 2) owns the Mekdall Gallery. He is gloomy and frequently moans about being cheated by his customers, but he charges decent prices.
	* Haga Wissel (NE female human expert 2/rogue 4) owns Echoes of the Past. She is cheerful and friendly but extremely hard-nosed about prices. She has been accused of having connections to House Tarkanan and even paying burglars to steal items from other collectors.
	* Kidro Osanak (N male gnome expert 8) owns Window on Yesterday. A wizened old gnome, Kidro harbors a deep resentment toward Haga Wissel, and though he can’t prove it, believes that she has stolen items from his shop. One of the only dealers in Little Xen’drik with more interest in the historical knowledge contained in his treasures than in their monetary worth, Kidro often sponsors the most challenging expeditions.
	* Biballin Postar (CG male halfling expert 4) owns Postar’s Jewelry Art Gallery, which specializes in the adornments of ancient Xen’drik. He is absent-minded and keeps completely irregular hours, but can be counted on to pay the best price for jewelry related to either the drow or the giants of the ancient and mostly forgotten kingdoms.
	* Reina Doiran (NG female human expert 2/sorcerer 6) owns Cloud Antiquities. Flamboyant and eccentric, she judges items quickly based on her own aesthetic sense rather than their historic value, and pays more for items that intrigue and appeal to her than for dusty trinkets of more scholarly worth.
	* Reina’s twin sister, Fista Doiran (NG female human expert 8) owns the Doiran Gallery (which once belonged to their parents) and has the opposite personality and artistic disposition. This allows them to get along amazingly well, and the twins cooperate in business dealings despite a strong sense of rivalry.

##### University District (University)

> Students carrying armloads of scrolls and books hustle to classes, while others sit or stand in circles, discussing the day’s lessons.

The home of Morgrave University, the University District is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge— while making as much profit as possible. From Morgrave itself to the businesses that have sprung up around it, love of learning coexists with love of earning and the two feed happily off each other. If scholarly interest can lead to great profit, or thirst for gold to historical discovery, then the residents of the University District are doubly satisfied.

- **Art Temple**: One of Upper Menthis’ four theaters, the Art Temple is famous for cutting-edge, avant-garde plays. It has no resident playwright; instead, the theater solicits submissions from across Khorvaire, though residents of Sharn pen most of its productions. The theater’s owner, Cassa Faer (N female elf expert 3), prides herself on discovering new talent, but she definitely gives preferential treatment to her personal acquaintances, and tends to become romantically involved with each new playwright whose play she produces.
- **Golden Horn**: This upscale inn is the local outpost of the Circle of Song. It has a considerable area set aside for members of the Circle, including a library, meeting hall, and even a small concert hall. The proprietor of the Horn is a man named Mandyran (CG male half-elf expert 3/bard 3). A former wanderer, the old man has settled down and opened the inn to help support the Circle.
- **Grand Stage**: Another of the theaters in Upper Menthis, the Grand Stage generally produces a more conservative and traditional repertoire than the others, including a mixture of classic works and more. modern plays echoing the style and conventions of the classics. The well-beloved The Changeling’s Prophecy, by the ancient playwright Duthic Olan, appears on the Grand Stage’s docket every two to three years. This is not the place to see avant-garde productions that wrestle with existential concerns in the wake of the Last War, but rather the Grand Stage presents a constant selection of the great cultural heritage of Galifar.
- **Kavarrah Concert Hall**: The grand auditorium near the University, Kavarrah Concert Hall hosts the finest musical performances in Sharn. Residents of Upper Central, Upper Northedge, and Upper Menthis’s Platinate district attend shows in Kavarrah dressed in their finest glamerweave garments, often arriving by skycoach after dining in Skyway restaurants.
- **Haftak’s Books and Binding**: Haftak ir’Clarn (NG male human aristocrat 2/expert 1) runs this bookstore and bindery, and uses its facilities to publish the Sharn Inquisitive, the city’s local chronicle. A minor member of one of Breland’s noble families, Haftak has a prominent cousin in the parliament and a significant fortune at his disposal, which allowed him to start the Inquisitive as a sideline to his marginally profitable main business.
- **Sharn Opera House**: Breland has a long heritage of operatic composition, and the Sharn Opera House is committed to regular performances of classic Brelish works, as well as newer material from across Khorvaire. The opera house consists of a grand auditorium in Dalannan Tower, with comfortable seating for 3,000 people. As with the Kavarrah Concert Hall, attending performances in the Sharn Opera House usually become very formal affairs, but the opera house also offers standing-room galleries for those of less wealthy means.
- **Stargazer Theater**: Another of Upper Menthis’s four theaters, the Stargazer Theater is located on the top of Kelsa Spire, open to the sky. A grassy park surrounds the open-air amphitheater, allowing audience members to picnic on the lawn if they prefer. Once confined to the summer months, its performance season was extended to the whole year thanks to the weather-controlling powers of House Lyrandar. Now, audiences can enjoy the warmth of a spring or summer day whenever they visit the Stargazer. Its repertoire focuses on classics with family appeal.

#### Morgrave University (Upper Menthis)

The university was founded by Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave in 738 YK to be a "beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city, illuminating the forgotten secrets of the past." The current Master of Morgrave University is Larrian ir'Morgrave, the oldest heir of the Morgrave line. Larrian has spent decades studying the civilizations of ancient Xen'drik. The University has made great gains in research regarding the continent of Xen'drik, mostly by funding expeditions of Wayfinders and adventurers, who bring back artifacts and information to fill the university's museums and libraries.

Morgrave University is not the most reputable institution in Khorvaire. It lacks the resources of the Library of Korranberg or Wynarn University, and many claim that its archaeological activities are infested with smugglers and treasure hunters. While the university lacks the clout of its peers in Korranberg and Aundair, it is much more accessible to young adventurers who have yet to build a reputation.

Morgrave University owns most of the buildings in Upper Menthis, even ones not used for University purposes. The University itself fills Dalannan Tower, which is crowned by the enormous dome of Lareth Hall. Five slender spires ring Dalannan Tower, representing and named after the Five Nations, and they house most of Morgrave’s students. The university library is located just below Lareth Hall, and the Commons — atop Breland Spire — is a popular gathering spot for students and faculty alike.

- **The Bridge**: The long, arcing, covered bridge that connects Breland Spire (and the Commons) to Dalannan Tower serves as a center of student life at Morgrave. Shops line one side of the bridge, including bookstores, paper makers, clothing and equipment vendors catering to students, and related businesses. Notices, such as announcements of campus events, job opportunities, items for sale, rooms for rent, and the like, cover the opposite wall of the bridge.
- **The Commons**: Pleasantly situated atop Breland Spire, the Commons is a large open-air plaza with a commanding view of the neighboring towers and lower reaches of the city. Every morning, vendors wheel their carts up to the Commons and offer a mouth-watering variety of food from a dozen different cuisines, from Karrnathi sausage to Talentan kebabs. The offerings are hardly haute cuisine, but they are authentic and generally delicious.
- **Dezina Museum of Antiquities**: Home to the finest collection of artifacts from Xen’drik in Khorvaire, Morgrave University’s Dezina Museum fills many of the mid-levels of Dalannan Tower. Its collection would be even more impressive were it not for the strong tendency the University has to sell valuable artifacts rather than put them on display, not to mention the steady stream of items routinely stolen from the museum. More interesting (at least to some) than the museum’s displayed collection are its vaults, vast rooms below the publicly accessible areas of the museum that contain unopened crates of treasures waiting to be cataloged, shelves of artifacts deemed uninteresting, and a few secret rooms holding items too important or dangerous to put on public display.
- **Great Hall of Aureon**: The grand temple to the god of knowledge at Morgrave University, the Great Hall of Aureon is an architectural marvel as well as a sacred site often visited by pilgrims. Scholars, scientists and artificers, and any others who seek knowledge have made a practice of spending the night in the Great Hall. They believe that inspiration will visit them while they sleep on the marble floor of the majestic temple. Some of Breland’s greatest minds through the ages have claimed that their greatest breakthroughs came after a night in the temple. Merrix d’Cannith (the grandfather of the current head of House Cannith in Sharn) attributed the invention of living constructs (the first warforged) to stay in the Great Hall of Aureon. The Great Hall also provides a place to find experts in all fields. The temple staff represents the broad spectrum of scientific study, and if they do not know the answer to a question they can almost certainly find someone who does. The ordained clergy of the Great Hall include experts, wizards, loremasters, and bards, as well as clerics, and position in the hierarchy of the temple has nothing to do with character class or field of expertise.
- **Lareth Hall**: Named after the founder of Morgrave University, Lareth Hall holds the University’s administrative and faculty offices. This large domed structure at the center of the campus, situated at the top of Dalannan Tower, contains the office of president Larrian ir’Morgrave (N male human aristocrat 2/expert 5), along with the bursar’s and registrar's offices, and— in a large chamber at the top of the dome— the abode of Flamewind, a gynosphinx.
- **Morgrave University Library**: Centrally located on the University campus near the top of Dalannan Tower (just below the dome of Lareth Hall), the Morgrave University Library has the most extensive collection of books in all of Breland. It pales in comparison to the great library at Korranberg, but a significant number of Zilargo expatriates live in Den’iyas and work to make the Morgrave Library the best resource it can be. History is clearly a specialty of the University, and those using the Morgrave Library for research into the history of Sharn or Xen'drik gain a +6 bonus on their History checks. The Library offers a+4 bonus on History checks related to other areas and on Arcana checks. Those without formal ties to Morgrave University must pay a fee of 100 gp per day to conduct research at the Library. Students, alumni, and those working for Morgrave can use the Library for free.
- **Shava House**: Shava House, a small academic community on the campus of Morgrave University, was originally a housing unit for professors with no families. It has developed into more of an intentional community: the residents share meals heavily laden with academic discourse, and generally share an interest in the history of Xen’drik. An unassuming member of this commune is Dala Arand — a friendly scholar active in planning expeditions to Xen drik, while also secretly serving as a spy for the Order of the Emerald Claw.
