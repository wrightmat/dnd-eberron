The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature. 2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can’t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder’s next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn’t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container. 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead. 8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it. 10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points."

Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host’s chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease is cured before the tadpole’s emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated."

Stinging Wasps. Each creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 32 (5d12) piercing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t have disadvantage on attack rolls. 2. Spinning Spiders. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and be restrained for 1 minute as it is squeezed by the webbing. A restrained creature can escape with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check as an action. 3. Venomous Centipedes. Each creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage, but is still poisoned. 4. Infesting Grubs. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be infested by 4 (1d4+2) rot grubs. At the start of each of an infected creature’s turns, it takes 1d6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the creature’s next turn deals 1 fire damage to the creature and kills these rot grubs, ending the effect. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target, ending the effect. 5. Discordant Cicadas. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While a creature is frightened in this way, it is incapacitated. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage against future saves against this swarm for the next 24 hours. 6. Psychoactive Beetles. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or take 33 (6d10) psychic damage as it suffers from intense hallucinations."
