Discord:: Cardinal460
Pronouns:: he/him
Lines/Veils:: One veil I can think of for me, personally, is involving the death of children. This is not a topic we have to completely avoid by any means, but for trauma/PTSD reasons keeping things not very vividly detailed would be best. Specifically, if this occurs in or around a school setting, it is much more triggering. Even just a heads up beforehand would be fine. (I donâ€™t see this being an issue really, but I thought it worth mentioning regardless. It is not exactly a trigger that comes up frequently since it is so specific haha) 

* Has been playing for about 2 years, but just one long campaign (the one run by Kerrie)
