### Theme(s)
- Civilization (versus perceived as uncivilized) and Consciousness (dreams and surrealism)

#### Inspirations
- Atlantis (Greek myth)
- John C. Lilly (LSD and dolphins) 
- Avatar (James Cameron movie series)
- Princess Mononoke (movie)
- Adventure Zone: Ethersea
- Deep Ones of H.P. Lovecraft

### Brainstorm

- PCs live in an above water city (like Atlantis or Ethersea, but on the surface), occupied by various humanoid and aquatic races, but mostly merfolk (probably Tritons, mechnically). This city serves as a sort of waypoint and potential diplomatic base in which aquatic and non-aquatic races can co-exist, which doesn't happen anywhere else on Eberron.
- Their city uses an aquatic race (likely kuo-toa) as "service animals", for gathering food, transportation, and other things. They seem to the players to be treated well, but may not actually be. 
- Eventually the players learn these animals aren't treated well, and start to get dream visions of another world and race of people under the water (likely the sahuagin).
- Idea is to set up a moral dilemma where the players have to decide if their culture is truly the civilized one, when they treat the underwater people so badly, or if the other culture is in the right and they defect to fight on their side. Will need to set up a larger secret conflict between the two - like maybe the players' city is exploiting the underwater city in some way that the players won't abide?
- The merfolk city is likely in the Sea of Rage, equidistant between Sarlona, Argonnesson, and Khorvaire. The sea elves occupy the waters south of Aerenal between there and Argonnesson. The kuo-toa occupy the Dark Sea (between Argonnesson and Xen'drik), while the sahaugin are the main race in the Thunder Sea (concentrated in the region between Xen'drik and Khorvaire). The region between Khorvaire and Aerenal is generally dangerous to all species, due to the presence of Kraken Bay and the prevalence of undersea monsters.
- Adventures ideas:
	- Ancient aboleth ruins holding remnants of powerful magic… essentially, the undersea equivalent of Ashtakala and the Demon Wastes.
	- Kuo-toa ancient cities and haunted ruins, hinting at a previous civilization that fell and led to them becoming savages and servants.
	- Kraken Bay and a range of aquatic monsters.
	- An underwater Mournland-like region.
	- Thelanis manifest zone full of bioluminescent seaweed and aquatic fey.
	- Underwater Aereni sea elf city, ruled by aquatic Dealthless, and possibly tied to a manifest zone to Irian.
	- Kar'lassa and their planes.

### Outline

#### Act 1

##### Introduction: Life in Tidecrown

- The PCs are residents of **Tidecrown**, a magnificent above-water city where merfolk (Tritons, primarily) coexist with land-dwellers.
- Tidecrown is a **hub of diplomacy and trade** between surface and underwater civilizations, a unique marvel of interspecies cooperation.
- Kuo-toa serve as **laborers, transporters, and food gatherers**, treated like beasts of burden.
- **Dr. Lilly Fellwater**, an eccentric merfolk scientist, oversees “kuo-toa communication” experiments, dismissing any evidence of their sentience.
- **Primarch Tethys Morandel**, the merfolk ruler, keeps Tidecrown stable but **suppresses dangerous truths**.

##### First Signs of Mystery

- A **sahuagin delegation** arrives with cryptic warnings that Tidecrown is committing grave sins against the ocean.
- Kuo-toa begin exhibiting strange behavior:
    - Drawing **symbols and patterns** that seem too structured for non-sapient creatures.
    - Worshipping **something nameless** beneath the waves.
    - Becoming resistant to commands, some even vanishing into the deep.
- Dr. Fellwater insists this is **a breakthrough in communication**, while others whisper of **omens of disaster**.
- The PCs start receiving **dream visions** of an ancient civilization **lost beneath the sea**, its memories calling to them.

##### Escalation: A Journey Below

- The PCs are sent on **a mission to the ocean depths** — to negotiate with the sahuagin, recover stolen supplies, or investigate kuo-toa unrest.
- **In the abyss, they discover ruins** — evidence that the sahuagin once ruled a mighty empire, now **plundered by Tidecrown**.
- They also **witness kuo-toa worship rituals** — prayers that seem to be shaping **something monstrous**.
- The **stolen sahuagin relics are revealed** — several **prismatic pearls** imbued with **ancient power**, currently hoarded by Tidecrown’s leaders.
- The PCs return to **Tidecrown with troubling evidence**, but their concerns are dismissed.

##### Final Blow of Act 1: A Lie Exposed

- **A massive kuo-toa uprising erupts.** Tidecrown officials brand them as “rabid creatures” needing extermination.
- A **monstrous entity** — an early form of the Deep One — **manifests for the first time**, proving that kuo-toa worship is **reshaping reality itself**.
- The PCs must decide whether to **follow orders and suppress the uprising** or **seek the truth** behind what’s really happening.

#### Act 2

##### Exile and Descent

- If the PCs question the official story, they become **outcasts, fugitives, or rebels**.
- A sahuagin emissary leads them to **the ancient city of Vorthezk**, a sprawling metropolis hidden deep below.
- They meet **Abyssal Lord Vortheka**, an ancient sahuagin warlord who reveals that Tidecrown’s **prismatic pearls were once sacred artifacts**, linked to **sealing an ancient force of destruction**.
- The **Deep One is real**, and kuo-toa belief is **bringing it into existence**.
- The sahuagin believe the **only way to stop it is to recover the pearls and perform the sealing ritual once more.**

##### The War Begins

- The sahuagin prepare an **assault on Tidecrown** to reclaim their sacred relics.
- Tidecrown **declares war on the sahuagin**, branding them as aggressors.
- Meanwhile, the **Deep One’s form continues to coalesce**, growing stronger as kuo-toa fervor spreads.
- A **new celestial ally appears** — **Naqaris**, an ancient **Couaxolotl**, one of the last remnants of the celestial beings who originally sealed the Overlords.
    - Naqaris is wise, benevolent, and deeply sorrowful, warning that **the old methods of sealing the Deep One may not be enough**.
    - The Couaxolotl were thought extinct, but Naqaris has awakened due to the rising darkness.
    - Naqaris offers **guidance on how to retrieve the pearls and stop the Deep One**.

##### Pearl Retrieval Arc

- The PCs must retrieve the **prismatic pearls**, each located in different perilous locations:
	1. **The Sunken Vault** – A **ruined sahuagin temple**, now infested with deep-sea horrors.
	2. **The Forbidden Trench** – A **scar in the ocean floor**, rumored to lead to the elemental depths.
	3. **The Leviathan’s Maw** – The **belly of an ancient, sleeping behemoth**, where a pearl was swallowed long ago.
	4. **The Elders’ Keep** – **Tidecrown’s secret chamber**, where the merfolk have hidden the last pearl for generations.

- Each pearl retrieval brings the PCs closer to the truth — the Deep One cannot be stopped with force alone, and the kuo-toa may not be able to let go of their god once fully awakened.

##### Climax of Act 2: The Reckoning Begins

- The sahuagin **launch their assault on Tidecrown**.
- The merfolk **call in sea elves and land-dwelling allies** to defend the city.
- **The Deep One fully manifests.** Reality warps, the ocean turns black, and storms rage.
- The PCs must make **a critical decision**:
    - **Side with the sahuagin**, leading to Tidecrown’s downfall.
    - **Defend Tidecrown**, dooming the sahuagin to oblivion.
    - **Try to broker peace**, risking rejection from both sides.

#### Act 3

##### The War Peaks

- If the PCs sided with **Tidecrown**, the sahuagin **unleash their last, most devastating forces**.
- If they sided with **the sahuagin**, the merfolk **trigger Tidecrown’s secret doomsday weapon** to destroy them.
- If they sought **diplomacy**, both sides **resist peace,** forcing the PCs into a desperate, last-ditch effort.

##### The Deep One Awakens

- **The Deep One fully ascends**, warping **reality itself** as the kuo-toa worship reaches its peak.
- The PCs must decide:
    - **Banish or seal it** using the pearls and Naqaris' celestial guidance.
    - **Kill it, if possible**, though at immense cost.
    - **Let it rise,** embracing a new era of chaos and unknowable change.

### Major NPCs

- Animal handler NPC based on John Lilly who reveals with issues with the kuo-toa to the players.
- Leader of the sahuagin people.
