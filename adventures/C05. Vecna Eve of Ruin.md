 #campaign 

### Theme(s)

* The Power of Secrets

### Player Characters



### Major NPCs



### Outline



### Player-Facing Information



### Introduction and Session Zero



### DM Notes

* Would need MAJOR changes based on the reviews I've seen. Some of the best information is from Dungeon Master of None, who gave some great information on how to make the campaign more interesting as well. Would only be worth doing if the players were really into the idea.
