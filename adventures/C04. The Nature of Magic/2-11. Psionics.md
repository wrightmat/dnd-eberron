### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Doing something inspired by D20's Mentopolis, or Pixar's Inside Out, could be a lot of fun, but would need to be a tight story that's pared down from those. Maybe they wake up in a strange place with new artifacts/gems/something on their person, which are color coded to indicate their role (emotions, areas of the brain, or whatever) and they only find out later that they're inside someone's mind. The person whose mind they're in is Malakar's lesser officer who is controlling psionic magic by using one of the remaining hanbalani alta to focus his mind. The players need to interrupt this focus (or kill him I guess) from inside of his mind.
- Mind Battles: Engaging in psionic duels within the mindscape.
