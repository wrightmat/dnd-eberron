### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Possibly have each player roll a die and drop them in a different location across Aundair/Breland/Trane based on the roll. Then they'd either need to find a way to get back with each other, communicate with each other, or gather their own information about what's going on in their location. Probably four locations (so there's a chance of overlap between them): Arcanix, Sigilstar, Stormhome, and Sharn.
