### Background and Hook(s)

* Have each player roll a d4 and drop them in a different location across central Khorvaire based on the roll. Then they either need to find a way to get back to each other, communicate with each other, or gather their own information about what's going on in their location.
* The players’ first goal becomes clear: discover why their magic was drained and seek a way to restore it. Initial exploration uncovers a fragment of a dragonshard imbued with unusual magical energy, pointing toward nexuses of power tied to the schools of magic.

 - [ ]  **Sharn** (2)

- The primary point of interest should be Morgrave University, where any player landing here could get information about magic and other academic institutions across Khorvaire.

- The primary point of interest should be Sigilstar University, where any player landing here could get information about magic.

 - [ ]  **Stormhome** (4)

- Players landing here would immediately notice that storms have racked the island. If asking around, they'd learn that until recently, magic controlled the weather here but that magic is no longer working. The Raincallers Guild Hall would be the place to ask about that.
