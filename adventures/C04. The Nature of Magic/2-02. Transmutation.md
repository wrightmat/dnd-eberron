### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Navigating to Mordain's Hall**

- Players must navigate the Forest of Flesh in order to find the Tower of Mordain within Mordain's Hall. This requires three successful DC 12 (+hours of travel) Survival checks for each hour, with any failures resulting in a random encounter.

`dice: [[Mordain’s Hall#^random-encounters]]`

- When the players arrive at the Tower of Mordain, there's no tower there! Instead, there's a black obelisk, 15 feet tall, marked with strange runes. The obelisk radiates an aura of arcane energy, in the form of transmutation magic. If touched, the obelisk instantly hurls anyone within 50 feet through time and space.

 - [ ]  **Back in Time**

- The PCs are sent back in time to 797 YK, when Mordain was excoriated from House Phiarlan.
- The adventure is to play out the events that took place, while stopping the BBEG from interfering (but need to figure out how to make it interesting, and still have player agency).
