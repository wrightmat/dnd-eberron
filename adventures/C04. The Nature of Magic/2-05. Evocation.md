### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Cool spells to use: Arcane Hand (5th level)
- Almost certainly something to do with Kaius III, and the reveal that he's a vampire. Or maybe that was stopped somehow, and the current version isn't a vampire?
- Since we're doing necromancy in Xen'drik, we're combining Karrnath locations, and a few minor necromancy themes here.
