### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Korranberg**

- Adapt Candlekeep, and Candlekeep Mysteries adventures, as needed for this city.

 - [ ]  **The Gate of Joy**

- Pylas Pyrial is a feyspire, known as the Gate of Joy. Most of the time it rests in the Moonlit Vale of Thelanis, at certain times it is drawn into Eberron. The players find the feyspire in Eberron, but when they approach it, they're quickly drawn into the plane of Thelanis.
- The Gate of Joy in Thelanis is a community of gnomes, but ruled by a summer eladrin named Ihan de Rhaan. The Seat of the Summer Court is the only place of warmth on the plane now, as the Prince of Frost has returned and taken over the plane from his seat at the Moonlit Vale.
- The entirety of Thelanis is quickly becoming a frigid place where the snow never melts and the trees are eternally covered in frost. Very much like Narnia when the White Witch was ruling.
