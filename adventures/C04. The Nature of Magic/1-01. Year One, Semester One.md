### Background and Hook(s)

* The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom’s faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm’s effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.
* Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor’s waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by Murgaxor Grenshel, the villain the characters will likely face at the end of this year. Murgaxor intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

### Scenes and Situations

#### Orientation Week

##### Day 1 (Moving In)

 - [ ]  **Introduction**

- This adventure begins when students have arrived on Strixhaven’s campus and the term’s classes are about to start. For the characters, the first order of business is to complete the week of orientation events required of first-year students.
- Players are welcome to explore campus, but are encouraged to find their dorm rooms since it's already late evening.

 - [ ]  **Dormitory Rooms**

- The characters' welcome letters included the details of their dormitory assignments, and how to access their rooms. The transport circles described in the Biblioplex can be used to get the players to their individual dorm rooms by simply standing on one and thinking of their room. This method cannot be used to access any other dorm wings unless given permission to do so.
- They arrive in a hallway, within a small alcove which contains a transport circle that can move the players back to the Biblioplex. There are three doors leading to shared (between two people) 15x15 rooms, one of which magically opens for each appropriate player. One more door leads to the resident advisor's room, a small common room can be seen through a bank of floor-to-ceiling windows, and shared bathrooms are located at the end of the hall (two gender-neutral private rooms which include showers).
- Each room houses two wooden beds, each bunked over a wooden desk, and a small gelatinous cube refrigerator. On each desk is a sheet of paper, which outlines all of the events for Orientation Week, presented as a checklist. It states that each student must turn in their completed checklist at the end of the week, and this is required before starting classes.
- Roll to determine which PCs are rooming with each other. Also choose a random NPC to be their RA.
- Players have the night to do whatever they'd like, describe how they're settling in, and chat with their roommate and possibly other players in the hallway. In the morning, their Orientation Week begins!

##### Day 2 (Biblioplex Scavenger Hunt)

 - [ ]  **Introducing the Biblioplex**

- Day 2 of Orientation, consisting of a scavenger hunt, begins in the Biblioplex, the university’s grand library.
>Majestic marble archways, tomes seemingly stacked for miles, and the infectious energy of hundreds of young adults fill the Biblioplex, the grand library at the heart of Strixhaven University. The sights, sounds, and sparks of magic in the air are wondrous.
>Your acceptance letter stated that you must report to the Biblioplex’s Hall of Oracles to receive instructions on new-student orientation. The hall sits at the center of the Biblioplex’s first floor, and you can already see students gathering there.

- The characters know the basics about the Strixhaven campus, as well as the following information:
	- **Central Campus**. The Biblioplex isn’t the only building on the central campus, where students spend a lot of time. Two other popular locations are Firejolt Cafe and Bow’s End Tavern.
	- **Colleges**. Characters know the overall details about the five colleges that make up Strixhaven. They also know that each Strixhaven student chooses membership in a specific college at the start of their second year.
- Biblioplex Features. The Biblioplex has the following features:
	- **Ceilings**. The ceilings throughout the first floor of the Biblioplex are 50 feet high. The second- and third-floor ceilings are 30 feet high.
	- **Magic Stairs**. As in all Strixhaven buildings, the stairs and steps leading into and within the Biblioplex are enchanted to move and reshape for full accessibility.
	- **Transport Circles**. A runic circle is painted on the floor near each staircase in the Biblioplex, as well as at the top and bottom of the steps leading to the main entrance in area B1. These circles are permanent, customized teleportation circles. When a user moves onto a circle and mentally focuses on the floor to which they wish to travel, they are transported to the destination floor, arriving at that floor’s runic circle for that staircase. (Students are all aware that entering the second floor is forbidden without permission from a faculty member). The circle at the bottom of the front steps teleports users to the circle at the top of the stairs and vice versa.
	- **Students and Professors**. Students of all years and colleges can be found in the Biblioplex. as can professors from all the colleges.

 - [ ]  **B1. Main Entrance**

- Enchanted marble steps lead up 5 feet to a small plaza at the Biblioplex's entrance. The double door’s vertical handles are each carved in the likeness of a robed scholar. During the day. the doors stand open. At night, the doors are closed, locked, and sealed with an arcane lock spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the arcane lock is in effect). Only the Biblioplex’s reference librarians and certain faculty members know the arcane lock's password.

 - [ ]  **B2. Biblioplex Lounge**

- Luxurious couches and sturdy tables furnish this spacious area. Students, employees, and staff members often use this lounge to relax between shifts in the student store (area B5), the Biblioplex cafe (area B6), or elsewhere in the library. Each table holds piles of magazines, newsletters, flyers, and nonmagical scrolls from around campus. A character who examines these materials finds recruitment flyers from `dice:1d3` Extracurriculars. They also find “Help Wanted’’ ads for the Jobs at the Biblioplex.

 - [ ]  **B3. Student Café Seating**

- This area typically holds `dice:6d6` students, all of them studying, eating, chatting, or even sleeping. Many enjoy food and drinks from the café (area B6).

 - [ ]  **B4. Information Desk**

- Three faculty-appointed reference librarians work at each of these circular desks (use any of the professor stat blocks if needed). All are expert scholars and powerful mages. They can provide helpful instructions for where to find any public location or collection in the Biblioplex.

 - [ ]  **B5. Student Store**

- This small shop is stocked with books, equipment, and gear useful as academic supplies. The store’s manager is Groff Lundquist, a friendly Strixhaven staff member known for his ability to fashionably mix and match items of university apparel. Students can buy hats, scarves, tunics, robes, gloves, and other apparel embroidered with the Strixhaven star or with the sigil of any of Strixhaven’s colleges. Costs range from 5 cp to 5 gp or more, at your discretion.
- Once a character chooses a college at the start of second year, they receive a set of college robes, a knit hat, a scarf, a tunic, and gloves free of charge. (This set normally costs 5 gp.)
- In addition to nonmagical gear and clothing, the store also contains the magic items from the “Magic Items’’ section of chapter 2.

 - [ ]  **B6. Biblioplex Café**

- One wall of this area is covered with a mural made from a living tree’s roots, which move occasionally and make the entire place feel alive. The ceiling is covered in painted leaves, which change colors depending on the season thanks to a permanent illusion effect. The magic also prompts painted squirrels to run up and down the mural’s roots, and painted birds to chirp among the leaves.
- Up to ten students are typically present here during the day. Ordinarily, three more students work here, but during orientation, the cafe's manager, Aisla Fitzbottom (chaotic good gnome commoner), is working alone. She is charmingly perky and has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to recognizing students. However, her organizational skills are somewhat lackadaisical.
- The cafe always serves coffee and tea, which costs 1 cp per cup. The sandwich of the day varies. Roll below to determine which sandwich is available on any given day in the café.

| d6  | Sandwhich                                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Grilled halloumi with morels on wheat                |
| 2   | Toasted cockatrice gizzards on rye                   |
| 3   | Open-faced radish chips, deep-fried with dijon       |
| 4   | Crunchy frog legs on toast                           |
| 5   | Rainbow carrots and watercress chestnuts on<br>white |
| 6   | Dragonbreath peppers and salami on a bagel           |

 - [ ]  **B7. Lecture Hall**

- Each of these halls hosts interdisciplinary lectures for Strixhaven students. The seats magically grow or shrink to comfortably accommodate students of any size or body type. The halls’ acoustics are magically enhanced to amplify the professor's lecture and minimize the disruption of side conversations.
- While a class is in session, each hall holds a professor and up to thirty students.

 - [ ]  **B8. Study Area**

- These open study areas feature simple wooden tables and chairs. During the day, up to thirty students can typically be found here.
- If the characters pass by the western study area before orientation, members of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild are pulling costumes and props from a half dozen old trunks. The guild is preparing for an event later on the Biblioplex’s lawn: a game they call Beholders versus Behirs. Rosie Wuzfeddlims (CG female gnome first-year student) is directing students as they cobble together beholder and behir costumes, as well as visual effects made from sheets, blankets, wooden frames, tin plates, and illusion magic.

 - [ ]  **B9. Book Garden**

- In these quiet areas, students sit on the grass and study among lush foliage. Sometime last year, three awakened shrubs wandered in here and settled in each garden, and the university has welcomed them to stay. Members of Witherbloom College typically tend this space, and three Witherbloom pledge mages can be found here most days.
- Members of the Fantastical Horticulture Club often relax in this area and hold meetings here from time to time. If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, Urzmaktok Grojsh (N male orc Witherbloom apprentice) is here, recruiting first-year students to the club.

 - [ ]  **B10. Main Stacks**

- Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves fill the center and the east end of the library’s first floor, with the denser east stacks under a magic effect that shifts them when students approach, creating space to stand single-file between them. These books are mostly introductory texts, and first-year students are often directed here by their instructors. In each of these areas, two cogwork archivists busily shelve returned or misfiled books.
- Characters who browse these shelves unaided stumble on what they need with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. However, it’s always easier to ask a reference librarian (area B4).

 - [ ]  **B11. Hall of Oracles**

* This hallowed hall is filled with statues of the university’s past Oracles. At the center of the hall, a pulsing ball of magical energy — the Strixhaven Snarl — fills the area with bright light.

 - [ ]  **B12. Student and Alumni Art Gallery**

- This crisp-looking room features white walls and columns that stretch from floor to ceiling. Displayed on or within these are art pieces representative of various media. Students from Prismari College typically tend this space, and three Prismari pledge mages can be found here most days, either cleaning the gallery or studying the techniques used in the displayed pieces. A storage area at the back holds supplies and artwork waiting to go on display.
- The Distinguished Society of Fine Artists often meets and holds discussions here. If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, Cadoras Damellawar (CG elf first-year student) is here recruiting first-year students to the society.

 - [ ]  **B13. Amphitheater**

- This impressive stage is used for lectures, for assemblies, and as a gathering place in case of emergencies. Magic steps lead up to the stage from the floor of the library. Members of the Play actors Drama Guild often use this stage to meet and rehearse when the Rose Stage on Silverquill’s campus is unavailable.
- If the characters pass by this area before or after orientation, Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III (N human first-year student) is here recruiting new students to the Playactors Drama Guild.

 - [ ]  **B14. Student Activities Center**

- This room is filled with tables and chairs and is available to any student organization registered with Strixhaven for use as a meeting place, rehearsal facility, or crafting site, or for other approved purposes.
- If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, it is set up to promote Extracurriculars. The tables are covered with flyers from the Dead Languages Society, the Dragonchess Club, the Dragonsguard Historical Society, Future Entrepreneurs of Strixhaven, the Intramural Gymnastics Club, the Intramural Silkball Club, the Intramural Water-Dancing Club, the Mage Tower Cheer Squad, the Strixhaven Iron-Lifters Society, the Strixhaven Show Band Association, the Strixhaven Star, and Student-Mages of Faith, and are staffed by the students listed in “Extracurriculars" as being associated with them.
- Extracurricular groups not here can be found elsewhere in the Biblioplex, along with their student NPCs — the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild (area B8), the Fantastical Horticulture Club (area B9), the Distinguished Society of Fine Artists (area B12), and the Playactors Drama Guild (area B13).

 - [ ]  **B15. Student Council Hall**

- Filled with wooden tables and benches, this room has a flag displaying the Strixhaven star symbol hanging on its back wall. Here, a student council publicly debates Strixhaven policies that most affect the student body. The leaders of the school’s Extracurriculars come to the council to conduct matters of business, and the council usually meets on the first day of every month. Outside those meeting days, the room is used for other official university business or stands empty.

 - [ ]  **B16. Advanced Student Stacks**

- Rooms on the Biblioplex’s second floor can be accessed only with keys held by faculty members, or that the reference librarians in area B4 grant students on a case-by-case basis. Typically, students don’t receive keys to these stacks until they’re studying for their final thesis during their fourth year at Strixhaven. The arcane knowledge in the books here is not public — and is sometimes dangerous.
- To prevent overly ambitious mages and Strixhaven’s enemies from teleporting into and accessing this area, two **shield guardians** patrol at all times. Both the guardians have sleep as their stored spell, and their control amulets are in the possession of two of the librarians on duty in the Biblioplex.
- Students with permission to work here are given passwords by which the Constructs recognize them as friends.

 - [ ]  **B17. Advanced Student Office**

- These private offices are for students working on their theses, accessed using the same keys that allow access to area B16.

 - [ ]  **B18. Advanced Student Lounge**

- This rest area is designed to help stressed-out senior students unwind. Large tables are set up for gaming and shelves are filled with recreational reading material. The area can be accessed only through the advanced student stacks (area B17).

 - [ ]  **B19. The Compendium**

- This area on the library’s third floor holds copies of most of the mundane, widely available written works in the multiverse. The books are inscrutably cataloged, so it’s almost impossible to find anything without requesting information from a reference librarian (area B4). Characters who look for information without obtaining help discover what they're looking for only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.
- At the center of this area stands a statue depicting a mighty, benevolent dragon. The magical statue reads aloud the contents of most books placed in front of it if a character makes that request verbally or mentally. (The magic of the statue can assess text such as verbal curses that present a danger if read aloud, and the statue ignores requests to read such text.)

 - [ ]  **Orientation Challenge**

- When the characters enter the Hall of Oracles to begin orientation, read or paraphrase the following:
>An almost sacrosanct sense of calm descends as you step into the Hall of Oracles. "Brilliant scholars," says a rich, soothing voice radiating from the hall’s central snarl of glowing energy. "Your attention, please.
“As you are now Strixhaven University students, this storied Biblioplex will be your second home for research, studies, and even leisure. And to introduce you to it, we will embark on Orientation Week's first event — a scavenger hunt!"

- A small parchment materializes in front of the characters. It presents a list of clues.
>“The rules are simple," the voice says. “Each clue on this list will lead you to a different location in the Biblioplex. Simply travel to the area each clue references and perform the action the clue suggests. Time is of the essence. You have only until the end of the day to finish your hunt.
“Solve as many clues as you can, because at each location, you may win a prize! Now then, off you go!”

- A character can win a prize for each clue they solve but can receive only one item in each place. If a character tries to redo a clue to receive a second item, the magic that reveals the item doesn’t work again. Here are the clues:
	- Clue 1. You’ll forget all about any trouble or plight when you step forward and are ensnarled in light.
	- Clue 2. Alumni commission works when they retire, seeking promising mages to inspire.
	- Clue 3. Each group deserves a free treat for their investment. Serve up this list and enjoy your refreshment.
	- Clue 4. These leafy beds aren't always what they seem. Give them a pat and see what you glean.
	- Clue 5. Some stars are ancient, enduring, and bright. But others — maybe you! — are born on opening night.
- Each clue can be unraveled either by deduction, or with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. A decoded clue points the characters toward one of the areas of the Bibliopiex as well as the action they must take to receive a prize in that area.
- Explain the Biblioplex’s areas in detail before the characters begin this scavenger hunt, so they have an idea of which areas the clues point to. Have the characters begin the scavenger hunt with the first clue, since it points to the room they’re already standing in. The players can then complete the other clues in any order they wish.

 - [ ]  **Clue 1: Hall of Oracles**

- This clue refers the characters to the room they start the orientation in (area B11).
- If a character touches the pooled energy below the snarl, they momentarily lose track of their body, overwhelmed by the snarl’s magical power. The character automatically disengages from the snarl and discovers that they are holding a [[potion of healing]].

 - [ ]  **Clue 2: Student Art Gallery**

- This clue refers to the Student and Alumni Art Gallery in area B12.
- When the characters wander through the gallery, they see a portrait of several older alumni wearing Prismari College robes. If a character examines the portrait, they find a plaque that reads: “At Strixhaven we were all inspired.” Below the plaque is a small lever. If a character uses an action to pull the lever, a box pops out of the wall containing a Strixhaven pennant for each character in the party. Once it dispenses the pennants, the box disappears back into the wall and doesn’t work for the characters again.

 - [ ]  **Clue 3: Biblioplex Café**

- This clue refers to the Biblioplex Cafe in area B6.
- When the characters enter the cafe, they see several students enjoying drinks and snacks. Aisla Fitzbottom, the cafe manager, is a Strixhaven staff member and the only worker behind the counter at present. The characters must present their scavenger hunt list to Aisla. When they do, she tells them to come behind the counter and help her quickly restock the cafe’s sandwiches and baked goods from several modified Howard’s handy haversacks.
- If a character goes above and beyond in their assistance with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, Aisla gives that character a random trinket (from the magic items in the campaign book). Many students have ignored her requests for help during the orientation, she says, so she decides to make an exception with a gift from her own pockets. Plus, she likes the new students’ ambition.

 - [ ]  **Clue 4: Book Garden**

- This clue refers to the book gardens of area B9.
- When the characters enter a book garden, they see a lush arboretum. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that three of the shrubs are not ordinary greenery, but are instead awakened shrubs, each with a glistening crown of leaves. If a character uses an action to pat the shrubs on these leaves, the branches part to reveal a cuddly Strixhaven mascot, representing a random mascot. This magic works only once per character.

 - [ ]  **Clue 5: Amphitheater**

- This clue refers to the amphitheater in area B13.
- When the characters reach the amphitheater, they see an impressively lavish stage, with the curtains drawn back as if to reveal performers on the opening night of a major production. If a character recites, sings, hums, belches, or otherwise emits any line or tune while standing on the stage, bright floodlights snap on around the stage’s perimeter — a number of lights equal to the number of characters in the group. Approaching any of the lights reveals a recess in which lies a hooded lantern filled with oil.

 - [ ]  **That Trunk Has Teeth!**

- Once the characters have completed as much of the scavenger hunt as they wish, they hear a commotion coming from the west shelves of the main stacks in area B10. Read or paraphrase the following:
>The joyous and energetic atmosphere of the first floor is shattered by panicked shouting. “That trunk!” a young elf screams, pointing toward the stacks as she runs by. “That trunk has teeth! Please, anyone, stop it!”
Chaos erupts in the library as students stream in all directions, their books and papers flying as they shout in fear. The only faculty mages in sight are trying to deal with panicked students. You can't just let some monster ruin the first week. Time to step up!

- In the western part of area B8, the characters see a half dozen old trunks strewn about. Sheets, blankets, large wooden frames, and half-painted wooden props are scattered haphazardly around the tables where members of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild were setting up for a show. Rampaging throughout the mess is a trunk that has been transformed into a mimic, which attacks the characters as soon as they enter the area. Because the mimic
