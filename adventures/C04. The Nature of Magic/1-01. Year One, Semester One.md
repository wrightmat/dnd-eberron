### Background and Hook(s)

* The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom’s faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm’s effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.
* Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor’s waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by Murgaxor Grenshel, the villain the characters will likely face at the end of this year. Murgaxor intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

### Scenes and Situations

#### Orientation Week

##### Day 1 (Biblioplex Scavenger Hunt)

 - [ ]  **Introduction**

- This adventure begins when students have arrived on Strixhaven’s campus and the term’s classes are about to start. For the characters, the first order of business is to complete the orientation required of first-year students. Orientation begins in the Biblioplex, the university’s grand library.
>Majestic marble archways, tomes seemingly stacked for miles, and the infectious energy of hundreds of young adults fill the Biblioplex, the grand library at the heart of Strixhaven University. The sights, sounds, and sparks of magic in the air are wondrous.
>Your acceptance letter stated that you must report to the Biblioplex’s Hall of Oracles to receive instructions on new-student orientation. The hall sits at the center of the Biblioplex’s first floor, and you can already see students gathering there.

- The characters know the basics about the Strixhaven campus, as well as the following information:
	- **Central Campus**. The Biblioplex isn’t the only building on the central campus, where students spend a lot of time. Two other popular locations are Firejolt Cafe and Bow’s End Tavern.
	- **Colleges**. Characters know the overall details about the five colleges that make up Strixhaven. They also know that each Strixhaven student chooses membership in a specific college at the start of their second year.
- Biblioplex Features. The Biblioplex has the following features:
	- **Ceilings**. The ceilings throughout the first floor of the Biblioplex are 50 feet high. The second- and third-floor ceilings are 30 feet high.
	- **Magic Stairs**. As in all Strixhaven buildings, the stairs and steps leading into and within the Biblioplex are enchanted to move and reshape for full accessibility.
	- **Transport Circles**. A runic circle is painted on the floor near each staircase in the Biblioplex, as well as at the top and bottom of the steps leading to the main entrance in area B1. These circles are permanent, customized teleportation circles. When a user moves onto a circle and mentally focuses on the floor to which they wish to travel, they are transported to the destination floor, arriving at that floor’s runic circle for that staircase. (Students are all aware that entering the second floor is forbidden without permission from a faculty member). The circle at the bottom of the front steps teleports users to the circle at the top of the stairs and vice versa.
	- **Students and Professors**. Students of all years and colleges can be found in the Biblioplex. as can professors from all the colleges.

 - [ ]  **B1. Main Entrance**

- Enchanted marble steps lead up 5 feet to a small plaza at the Biblioplex's entrance. The double door’s vertical handles are each carved in the likeness of a robed scholar. During the day. the doors stand open. At night, the doors are closed, locked, and sealed with an arcane lock spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the arcane lock is in effect). Only the Biblioplex’s reference librarians and certain faculty members know the arcane lock's password.

 - [ ]  **B2. Biblioplex Lounge**

- Luxurious couches and sturdy tables furnish this spacious area. Students, employees, and staff members often use this lounge to relax between shifts in the student store (area B5), the Biblioplex cafe (area B6), or elsewhere in the library. Each table holds piles of magazines, newsletters, flyers, and nonmagical scrolls from around campus. A character who examines these materials finds recruitment flyers from `dice:1d3` Extracurriculars. They also find “Help Wanted’’ ads for the Jobs at the Biblioplex.

 - [ ]  **B3. Student Café Seating**

- This area typically holds `dice:6d6` students, all of them studying, eating, chatting, or even sleeping. Many enjoy food and drinks from the café (area B6).

 - [ ]  **B4. Information Desk**

- Three faculty-appointed reference librarians work at each of these circular desks (use any of the professor stat blocks if needed). All are expert scholars and powerful mages. They can provide helpful instructions for where to find any public location or collection in the Biblioplex.

 - [ ]  **B5. Student Store**

- This small shop is stocked with books, equipment, and gear useful as academic supplies. The store’s manager is Groff Lundquist, a friendly Strixhaven staff member known for his ability to fashionably mix and match items of university apparel. Students can buy hats, scarves, tunics, robes, gloves, and other apparel embroidered with the Strixhaven star or with the sigil of any of Strixhaven’s colleges. Costs range from 5 cp to 5 gp or more, at your discretion.
- Once a character chooses a college at the start of second year, they receive a set of college robes, a knit hat, a scarf, a tunic, and gloves free of charge. (This set normally costs 5 gp.)
- In addition to nonmagical gear and clothing, the store also contains the magic items from the “Magic Items’’ section of chapter 2.

 - [ ]  **B6. Biblioplex Café**

- One wall of this area is covered with a mural made from a living tree’s roots, which move occasionally and make the entire place feel alive. The ceiling is covered in painted leaves, which change colors depending on the season thanks to a permanent illusion effect. The magic also prompts painted squirrels to run up and down the mural’s roots, and painted birds to chirp among the leaves.
- Up to ten students are typically present here during the day. Ordinarily, three more students work here, but during orientation, the cafe's manager, Aisla Fitzbottom (chaotic good gnome commoner), is working alone. She is charmingly perky and has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to recognizing students. However, her organizational skills are somewhat lackadaisical.
- The cafe always serves coffee and tea, which costs 1 cp per cup. The sandwich of the day varies. Roll below to determine which sandwich is available on any given day in the café.
