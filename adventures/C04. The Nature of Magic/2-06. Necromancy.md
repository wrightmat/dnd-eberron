### Background and Hook(s)

* A rare event in which both Mabar and Dolurrh are coterminus at the same time is occurring with an epicenter in Xen'drik. This is a natural event that's drawing necromantic energy into it. It is also causing conflict between the native drow and the shadar-kai of Mabar, and both parties are using necromantic monster troops in their war that are exacerbating the situation. The players will need to decide how to handle the situation and reduce the number of necromantic forces, helping to close the combined manifest zone in the process.
