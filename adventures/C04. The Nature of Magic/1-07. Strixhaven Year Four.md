### Background and Hook(s)

* As the fourth and final year of the characters’ academic career at Strixhaven dawns, the university faces a crisis. In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does the Oriq threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university’s masters are powerless against the villain. It becomes clear that the characters must drop their studies and stop him at all costs.

 - [ ]  **A Sinister Shadow**

- Once the characters have cemented their fourth-year Extracurriculars, Jobs, and Relationships decisions as needed, it’s time to kick off this adventure.
- When the characters arrive for their final year at Strixhaven, the mood is muted. Social spaces are sparsely populated, students chat in whispered tones, and the campus’s energy is tense. Read or paraphrase the following when you’re ready to begin the adventure:
>All of your hard work has come down to this — your fourth and final year as a student of magic at Strixhaven University. But as soon as you arrive on campus, it’s clear that something is very wrong.
>Instead of the usual cheerful bustle, students mill about campus nervously. Here and there, you hear frightened whispers: “I heard they're called the Oriq. I heard they want to hurt us all.”
>The rumor mill has apparently discovered the grave events that happened last academic term.

- At this point, the characters might be waiting on the faculty to discover more about Oriq plans. However, they also might want to take this investigation into their own hands.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Just skip the Detention Bog. Use it only if/when the players actually get detention! Probably replace it with something like Wyrmsfang Jungle (or Fang Crater if not already used)?
