### Background and Hook(s)

* As the fourth and final year of the characters’ academic career at Strixhaven dawns, the university faces a crisis. In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does the Oriq threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university’s masters are powerless against the villain. It becomes clear that the characters must drop their studies and stop him at all costs.

 - [ ]  **A Sinister Shadow**

- Once the characters have cemented their fourth-year Extracurriculars, Jobs, and Relationships decisions as needed, it’s time to kick off this adventure.
- When the characters arrive for their final year at Strixhaven, the mood is muted. Social spaces are sparsely populated, students chat in whispered tones, and the campus’s energy is tense. Read or paraphrase the following when you’re ready to begin the adventure:
>All of your hard work has come down to this — your fourth and final year as a student of magic at Strixhaven University. But as soon as you arrive on campus, it’s clear that something is very wrong.
>Instead of the usual cheerful bustle, students mill about campus nervously. Here and there, you hear frightened whispers: “I heard they're called the Oriq. I heard they want to hurt us all.”
>The rumor mill has apparently discovered the grave events that happened last academic term.

- At this point, the characters might be waiting on the faculty to discover more about Oriq plans. However, they also might want to take this investigation into their own hands.

 - [ ]  **A Brief Distraction**

- While the characters wait to learn more about the Oriq, they discover some of their fellow students engaged in a game at Firejolt Café on the central campus. One of the characters’ Friends or Rivals is part of this scene, or you may choose another random student. When you’re ready to begin the scene, read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the name of the chosen student:
>The mood on campus might be gloomy, but as you cross the central campus, you see a few of your classmates smiling and gesturing outside Firejolt Café.
>A familiar face jogs up to you, waving and smiling in relief. “It’s so good to see you! Things have been dire around here lately, but some friends are inside about to start playing a game they call Scufflecup. Apparently, they found a box of animated teacups, and they figured out how to control the little buggers! Come on, let’s go check it out!”

 - [ ]  Scufflecup

- Scufflecup is a game students created after finding a box of teacups in a nearby building’s storage room. The students discovered that pouring hot tea into the cups animates them for 10 minutes and causes them to sprout little arms and legs. While animate, a cup uses the Scufflecup teacup stat block and does the bidding of whoever animated it.
- Characters who enter Firejolt Café find that the fireside lounge (area F5) has been rearranged into a play area for a game of Scufflecup. A student explains the game, which is played on the large table in the lounge’s center. The square tabletop is 5 feet on each side. The student who describes how to play is a character’s Friend, Rival, or Beloved.
- **Scufflecup Rules**. Each participant fills a teacup with hot tea and places it on the table. The participants then roll initiative. At least one Scufflecup participant is a student who isn’t a player character. On each of their turns, a participant can use a bonus action to mentally command their teacup either to attack another teacup within range or to try to shove another teacup off the table, using the rules for shoving in the Player’s Handbook. A participant loses the game if their teacup drops to 0 hit points or if their teacup falls off the table. The participant with the last cup standing wins. The winner receives a purse of donations from the crowd that totals 1,000 gp.
- **Cheering and Heckling**. A character who doesn’t want to participate in the game can contribute in one of the following ways:
	- **Cheer a Participant**. A character can encourage one of the game’s participants. That participant’s teacup gains advantage on its attack rolls.
	- **Heckle a Participant**. A character can taunt one of the game’s participants. That participant’s teacup has disadvantage on its attack rolls.

#### Week 3: Arcane Herbology Exam: Vegetation Identification

- The first Exam for Arcane Herbology takes place a few weeks after the characters’ Scufflecup game in Firejolt Café. Students must identify unlabeled groupings of different plants, lichens, and fungi. Like the course itself, this Exam is conducted in an outdoor lab located in Sedgemoor.
- Arcane Herbology covers techniques for using flora in potions, spells, and rituals. The course’s professor is Verelda Lang, an arcano-biologist whom the characters might recall from their first year of instruction.

 - [ ]  **Studying Phase**

- The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.
- Once you’ve asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 20 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters’ rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

 - [ ]  **Testing Phase**

- On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:
	- **Flora’s Arcane Properties**. Correctly selecting the properties of samples requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check.
	- **Specimen Identification**. Recalling the correct names of flora with arcane uses based on sight, smell, and texture requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check.
- Have each player note their character’s Exam results — how many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the test — on their copies of the tracking sheet.
