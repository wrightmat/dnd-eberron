### Outline

#### Act 1

* The beginning of the campaign will focus on the cave dungeon that the PCs initially inhabit. They will believe that this is the full extent of the campaign, with time spend performing jobs such as lighting torches and training minions. The primarily goal is to protect the treasure they have collected from invading heroes.
* PCs may die, and if they do they are simply replaced by a new version of themselves within the 24 hours. This should be unexplained at this stage, and just seen as how things work (just the magic of the dungeon respawning them, video game style).
* This is likely to cover three to four session at most, with a number of invasions from escalating challenge ratings. The act should end when the PCs are called to a special room (that they're not normally allowed in) to speak with the dungeon's big bad evil guy, their leader, the lich king Tzocar. He commends them for their work, and sends them on a special mission to seek out a very special treasure known as the Heart of Khyber.
* Possibly have Tzocar send them on a number of smaller fetch quests first, to introduce Khyber more organically, and then move the Heart of Khyber to the end of Act 2?

#### Act 2

* This act consists of the PCs exploring deeper and deeper into Khyber, in search of the Heart. It should follow a structure similar to the Stygian Library, with increasingly strange and difficult layers as the PCs get deeper. Each layer should have a unique feel and special challenges.
	* The lost kingdom of the dwarves destroyed by the Daelkyr
	* The realm of the Umbragen
	* Vale of the Inner Sun
	* Giant city
* Maybe the Heart of Khyber is found at the end of this act, and the twist is that it's used by Tzocar to some especially nefarious end that actually harms the players in some way.

#### Act 3

* Finally, the PCs have to hunt down Tzocar through the depths by navigating them again and then taking him out.
