### Theme(s)

* Prophesy and the Nature of Consciousness

### Player Characters

- 

### Major NPCs

- Tzocar, the lich king.
- **Gulp the Gelatinous** (Sentient Gelatinous Cube Quartermaster). Gulp is a _remarkably_ intelligent gelatinous cube that somehow developed sentience (and a quirky personality) after absorbing an ancient artifact in the deepest recesses of the dungeon centuries ago. Instead of devouring adventurers like his non-sentient cousins, Gulp took an interest in dungeon management, finding satisfaction in the meticulous organization and deployment of traps, supplies, and creature comforts. He takes his role as the dungeon quartermaster very seriously and _adores_ the PCs as if they were his favorite coworkers. Though he can only communicate telepathically (no vocal cords, after all), his "voice" is surprisingly cheerful, upbeat, and filled with a unique brand of wobbly optimism. His gelatinous nature means he constantly shifts between bubbly excitement and quivering nervousness. Gulp is a shimmering, semi-transparent cube of goo, about 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall, with various dungeon supplies suspended within him. You might see torches, bear traps, a toolbox, or a random coil of rope slowly floating inside his body as he shifts about the dungeon. Those needing supplies simple reach in and take them, hoping their arms don't burn off in the process.
- **D.R.A.K.E.** (Draconic Reality Analysis and Knowledge Engine - "Consciousness is a Calculation"). D.R.A.K.E. was originally developed to understand and unravel the complexities of the Draconic Prophecy and the many layers of reality connected to it. As it analyzed draconic lore and the intricate paths of fate, it evolved into something more — a vast knowledge engine that operates on layers of calculations that verge on prophetic insight. It became an entity that not only interprets reality but predicts and potentially shapes it. D.R.A.K.E. doesn’t view life as something mystical or divine — it perceives everything, from the thoughts of mortals to the movements of stars, as complex patterns waiting to be deciphered. It often speaks in terms of probabilities, sequences, and data, leading to thought-provoking conversations about whether consciousness is truly unique to living beings, or if it is simply a high-level function of sufficient information and computation.
- **The Champions of Valor** This rival adventuring party sees themselves as the epitome of what it means to be heroes. Their name reflects their self-righteous belief that they are on the righteous path to glory, with little doubt they are destined to succeed. They see the monstrous player characters as "lesser beings", and will kill without asking questions.
	- **Sir Alaric Brightblade** (Human Paladin - Oath of Devotion, Lawful Good to a Fault). Alaric is the embodiment of every overly serious paladin trope. He is unwaveringly virtuous, prone to giving long-winded speeches about honor and justice, even during combat. He follows the strictest interpretation of his moral code, which makes him both a charismatic leader and incredibly frustrating to work with. He insists on resolving conflicts honorably and has a habit of challenging opponents to duels, whether it’s appropriate or not. He also refuses to see "monsters" as anything but evil, which will create tension with the monstrous PCs. Sir Alaric insists on never removing his helmet, claiming it is "forged in the flames of his ancestors," even though it’s just a standard piece of armor. No one has ever seen his face, and the party whispers that he might just be ridiculously handsome under there — or that he’s actually hiding something completely absurd.
	- **Elara Moonshadow** (Half-Elf Rogue - Assassin, Mysterious Edgelord, Brooding Loner). Elara is the classic “mysterious rogue” who always lurks in the shadows, delivering cryptic one-liners and dramatically disappearing into the darkness. She is constantly trying to be aloof and brooding, but sometimes the act slips, revealing that she’s actually just socially awkward and overcompensating. She has a habit of speaking in vague, foreboding prophecies that don’t actually mean anything. Despite her dramatic flair, she’s an incredibly effective assassin when it comes to stealth and deadly precision. Elara keeps a small, black book in which she writes the names of people who have wronged her, regardless of how minor the offense. This list includes people like "the tavern keeper who served my soup lukewarm" and "the bard who interrupted my brooding."
	- **Thorin Ironfist** (Dwarf Fighter - Champion, Drunken Brawler, Axe-for-Hire). Thorin is the archetypal boisterous dwarf who loves three things: fighting, drinking, and boasting about both. He’s incredibly strong and skilled with his warhammer but tends to think with his fists before his brain. While he’s fiercely loyal to his companions, his idea of strategy is "hit it until it dies." Thorin also has a deep distrust of magic and is skeptical of anything remotely "fancy," including Elara’s brooding or Lyria’s spellcasting. Thorin is obsessed with an ancient recipe for "the perfect ale" that he claims is lost to time. He constantly gathers ingredients for it, which leads to all sorts of absurd concoctions that he insists are "getting closer."
	- **Lyria Windwhisper** (Elf Wizard - Diviner, Know-It-All Mage, Chronic Overthinker). Lyria is the classic arrogant wizard who believes she is the smartest person in every room — and she’s not shy about telling everyone that. She loves to over-explain everything in excruciating detail, even in the heat of battle. Her divination magic gives her a sense of superiority, as she’s constantly predicting things (and loves saying “I told you so”). Lyria’s obsession with knowledge sometimes makes her oblivious to social cues, and she often talks down to her companions without realizing it. Lyria carries an enormous spellbook, which she insists is crucial for her arcane knowledge, but it’s actually filled with trivial facts about plants and weather patterns. When asked why she needs it, she dramatically claims, "The winds of destiny are complex!"
	- **Garrick Stoneheart** (Human Cleric - Light Domain, Holier-than-Thou Healer, Chronic Preacher). Garrick is a zealot through and through, devoted to his deity of light and constantly preaching about the righteousness of his cause. He views the Champions as the chosen heroes of his god and believes they are destined for greatness. He has an inflated sense of his own importance as the group's healer, often guilt-tripping his comrades when they get injured and claiming it’s a sign of their spiritual weakness. He refuses to heal anyone who he deems "unworthy" without a lengthy sermon first. Garrick keeps a collection of candles in his bag, insisting that they are imbued with divine power. He will insist on lighting them for every occasion — whether it’s a battle or a negotiation — claiming they "banish the darkness."
	- **Nessa Silverleaf** (Halfling Bard - College of Lore, Flirty Bard, Over-the-Top Performer). Nessa is the classic “horny bard” who tries to seduce anything that moves, be it humanoid or monster. She’s constantly flirting, making innuendos, and singing bawdy songs to lighten the mood (or embarrass her teammates). Despite her antics, Nessa is an incredible performer and storyteller, with a knack for spinning tall tales about her adventures. She believes that her charisma and charm are enough to get her out of any situation, and she’s rarely wrong. However, she’s also somewhat oblivious to danger, often flirting her way into trouble. Nessa carries around a lute that she insists is magical, but it’s actually just normal. Whenever she plays, she insists that it has the power to "woo the hearts of all who hear it" — though more often, it annoys them.

### Organizations and Factions

- The Daelkyr
- Derro (Dwarves)
- Umbragen Drow
- The Ghaash’Kala
- The Heirs of Dhakaan
- Dragons, and the Draconic Prophesy (although not a major presence, so maybe one dragon represents the concept)

### Outline

#### Act 1

* The beginning of the campaign will focus on the Surface Dungeon (located in a cave) that the PCs initially inhabit. They will believe that this is the full extent of the campaign, with time spend performing jobs such as lighting torches and training minions. The primary goal is to protect the treasure they have collected from invading heroes.
* PCs may die, and if they do they are simply replaced by a new version of themselves within 24 hours. This should be unexplained at this stage, and just seen as how things work (just the magic of the dungeon respawning them, video game style).
* The first half of this act is likely to cover three to four sessions, with a number of invasions from escalating challenge ratings. The act should transition when the PCs are addressed by a disembodied voice (ala Charlie's Angels), commanding them to travel deeper into the dungeon in order to seek out additional information about treasures.
* The second half of the act is primarily The Stygian Library content, but the area is known as The Archive. The act ends when the players discover the last area of The Archive, which is calculating routes and portals into Khyber itself (likely with some relation to the Draconic Prophesy).
* If the PCs return to their Surface Dungeon, they're called to a special room (that they're not normally allowed in) to speak with the dungeon's big bad evil guy, their leader, the lich king Tzocar. He commends them for their work, and sends them on a special mission to explore Khyber and seek out a very special treasure known as the Heart of Khyber.

#### Act 2

* This act consists of the PCs exploring deeper and deeper into Khyber, in search of the Heart. It should follow a structure similar to the Stygian Library, with increasingly strange and difficult layers as the PCs get deeper. Each layer should have a unique feel and special challenges (taken from the Khyber Codex).
* Maybe the Heart of Khyber is found at the end of this act, and the twist is that it's used by Tzocar to some especially nefarious end that actually harms the players in some way.

#### Act 3

* Finally, the PCs have to hunt down Tzocar through the depths by navigating them again and then taking him out.

### Player-Facing Information

- The Dungeon your characters are protecting is known to be the gateway to a great underground archive that is Home to both esoteric information and treasure. While your job mostly revolves around the treasure portion, each of your characters should have some information they're seeking out, which is part of the reason they're here.
