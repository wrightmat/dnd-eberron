### Outline

#### Act 1

* The beginning of the campaign will focus on the Surface Dungeon (located in a cave) that the PCs initially inhabit. They will believe that this is the full extent of the campaign, with time spend performing jobs such as lighting torches and training minions. The primarily goal is to protect the treasure they have collected from invading heroes.
* PCs may die, and if they do they are simply replaced by a new version of themselves within the 24 hours. This should be unexplained at this stage, and just seen as how things work (just the magic of the dungeon respawning them, video game style).
* The first half of this act is likely to cover three to four session at most, with a number of invasions from escalating challenge ratings. The act should transition when the PCs are addressed by a disembodied voice (ala Charlie's Angels), commanding them to travel deeper into the dungeon in order to seek out additional information about treasures.
* The second half of the act is primarily The Stygian Library content, but the area is known as The Archive. The act ends when the players discover the last area of The Archive, which is calculating routes and portals into Khyber itself (likely with some relation to the Draconic Prophesy).
* If the PCs return to their Surface Dungeon, they're called to a special room (that they're not normally allowed in) to speak with the dungeon's big bad evil guy, their leader, the lich king Tzocar. He commends them for their work, and sends them on a special mission to explore Khyber and seek out a very special treasure known as the Heart of Khyber.

#### Act 2

* This act consists of the PCs exploring deeper and deeper into Khyber, in search of the Heart. It should follow a structure similar to the Stygian Library, with increasingly strange and difficult layers as the PCs get deeper. Each layer should have a unique feel and special challenges (taken from the Khyber Codex).
* Maybe the Heart of Khyber is found at the end of this act, and the twist is that it's used by Tzocar to some especially nefarious end that actually harms the players in some way.

#### Act 3

* Finally, the PCs have to hunt down Tzocar through the depths by navigating them again and then taking him out.

### Player-Facing Information

- The Dungeon your characters are protecting is known to be the gateway to a great underground archive that is home to both esoteric information and treasure. While your job mostly revolves around the treasure portion, each of your characters should have some information they're seeking out, which is part of the reason they're here.
