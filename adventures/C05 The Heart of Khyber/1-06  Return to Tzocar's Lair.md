### Background and Hook(s)

* The players return to their dungeon, with the power of the Heart of Khyber on their side. At this point, it should be clear that Tzocar doesn't care about them, and in fact decrees that they must hand over the Heart or he will kill them. If they do hand over the Heart, he plans to kill everyone else on Eberron by releasing the Overlords.
* Allow the players to learn about the Lair Actions of a demilich, with the idea that they could sabotage their own home (possibly with help from any found NPCs) in order to weaken Tzocar.

### Characters and Locations

* **Tzocar, the Whispering Skull** (LE male demilich). Once an ancient and powerful necromancer, Tzocar transcended mortality, achieving demilichdom after centuries of study and dark rituals. His goal was to unravel the secrets of death itself, a pursuit that rendered him something between an oracle and a tyrant. Tzocar is a master of manipulation, possessing a dry and cutting wit, a keen intelligence, and an endless well of condescension for those who serve him. His tone is typically mocking, as if heâ€™s speaking to children who can barely grasp the vast truths he has uncovered. However, he is quick to turn to threats if he feels his authority is being questioned. Tzocar prides himself on being the ultimate architect of the dungeon, believing his intelligence and knowledge are the foundation upon which all others must stand.
