>Our time here is magic! It's the only space you have to realize whatever it is that is beautiful, whatever is true, whatever is great, whatever is potential, whatever is rare, whatever is unique... - Ben Okri

### Theme(s)

* [[Magic]], Power, and Life

### Player Characters

- [[Alton Vorn'kyr Prescott]] (Alex)
- [[Hawthorne Winters]] (Kerrie)
- [[Cosset Theris]] (Jolene)
- [[Shear]] (Trey)

### Major NPCs

- **Malakar Draksang** (NE male dragonborn Oriq blood mage). Malakar was a warlock who attended Strixhaven as part of Silverquill College many years ago, but he was passed over for the role of Oracle. He had a special hatred for the Dragonsguard, who had stood in his way, and all the rest of Strixhaven's elite with them. Malakar was all ego, for he believed he was the preeminent mage in the entirety of Eberron. His arrogance was spiked with fits of rage — he was furious that others did not appreciate and recognize his superiority, and he would take it out on anyone who did not show utter deference to him. Malakar practiced all forms of forbidden magic, but was especially drawn toward blood magic, as he strived to awaken the Blood Avatar to demolish Strixhaven University and claim its world-renowned library of spells for himself.

### Organizations and Factions

- **Familiar House** (Strixhaven)
	- An Animal House-like fraternity, which is actually named three letters in ancient draconic, but since most people can't read them, they've become known as "Familiar House" around campus. The letters are "KLT" (in draconic), which represents their motto of: kosjirl (pet), laraek (weapon), thurirl (friend).
	- Initiates into Familiar House are brought to the wilds of Wyrmsfang Jungle (north of campus), where all sorts of exotic animals reside. Each initiate is walked through the jungle, and the first magical animal, plant, or other object that approaches them is destined to be their own familiar.
	- This organization has a secret meeting house on the north-east end of campus (between and past Silverquill and Quandrix) at the edge of the jungle. It appeals most to those of Chaotic alignments.
- **Scroll and Bones Society** (Strixhaven)
	- A secret society that's existed since the founding of the University, but it unknown by most. It functions as an elite organization where only the most exemplary students are asked to pledge themselves.
	- Initiates into the Scroll and Bones Society participate in a secret initiation ceremony in which a new spell, tailored specifically to them, is inscribed onto a scroll for the first time.
	- This organization has a secret meeting house located somewhere under Central Campus, where only members know the true location. It appeals most to those of Lawful alignments.
- **Oriq Order** (Strixhaven)
	- A secret society who uses magics "forbidden by the colleges of Strixhaven," and are obsessed with power at any cost. Most members are actually drop-outs of or those denied admission to Strixhaven, but the Order does attempt to draw members from the student body in order to further their goals.
	- Initiates into the Oriq Order learn all about the forbidden magic of Hemomancy. Those who complete the ritual of initiation are given a special feat that marked them as a member of the Oriq Order.
	- This organization has a secret meeting location on the far south end of campus (between and past Prismari and Witherbloom), several miles from campus, known as the Fortress Badlands. It appeals most to those of Evil alignments.
	- The original Oriq were aberrant dragonmark bearers born on Argonnesson. These marks are not random; they are the result of mana reacting to imbalances in the world. When magic is hoarded or twisted (such as through blood magic), the resulting disruptions cause aberrant dragonmarks to manifest in mortals.
	- The Oriq have recently associated with House Tarkanan of Khorvaire, as they are known aberrant dragonmark bearers. House Tarkanan serves as their agents across Khorvaire in the Oriq efforts to siphon magic away from the continent.
- **The Path of Light** (Faction: Adar, Sarlona)
	- **Beliefs**: A spiritual movement originating with the Kalashtar, the Path of Light emphasizes the alignment of life energy (mana) with Irian to banish darkness and chaos from the world. They view the misuse of mana as a perversion of its life-giving purpose.
	- **Role**: The Path of Light opposes Malakar’s hoarding of mana and sees the draining of magic as a threat to Eberron’s spiritual balance. They may serve as allies or guides, offering insights into Irian’s role in the flow of mana.
	- **Major NPCs**: Aither Lightwood, traveling monk (and her companion Seralath)
- **The Twelve** (Faction: Korth, Karrnath)
	- **Beliefs**: The Twelve is an arcane think tank formed by the Dragonmarked Houses to research and codify the uses of magic. While traditionally focused on practical applications, some members explore deeper metaphysical questions about the nature of mana.
	- **Role**: They can provide the players with access to arcane knowledge about dragonshards, ley lines, and nexuses. However, their ties to the Dragonmarked Houses may complicate alliances.

### Outline

#### Act 1

* **Introduction**: All of Strixhaven serves as the introduction of the campaign.
* **Inciting Incident**: BBEG's entry into the Biblioplex, and capturing of the Strixhaven Snarl.
* **First Plot Point**: Transportation of the PCs to Khorhaire.
* **Dramatic Question**: Will the players be able to build sufficient power to stop the BBEG?
- Will need to provide some information throughout the first act to give clues to and guidance for the second act.
	- First, the PCs should receive a representation of the magic circle (with only the eight "outer" school denoted) - this should be at the end of the first year.
	- At the end of the second year, they should receive the "ley lines map" handout (with only the lines, no points), as the capstone to Scrivening and Symbology.
	- If they dig deeper into either map, they might be able to find more information, and possibly even the more detailed versions. Otherwise, they should receive the "ley lines and points" map when they land in Khorvaire - giving them all the pieces to figure out that the points are color-coded to the schools of magic.

* Start out in Strixhaven, which is located in The Vast in Argonnessen, and has been teaching dragons and exceptional non-dragons in secrets for a long time. Each player should have some significant tie to magic - so discourage full martial classes like fighters and barbarians, but if used then the PC should think about where their power comes from, and how they want to grow their power as part of their character arc.
	* Could be fun to have different lectures that outline how each of the classes manipulate Mana to create magical effects.
- Downtime should be about 30% of the adventure - so every other session or so, ask what players are doing.
- Come up with a table, or several tables, for random activities that can be done. Especially for downtime.
- Tables of random students, random professors, and random magical happenings (that can be whole adventures on their own). Use printed cards for the NPCs, and possibly professors too.
- Add more exams that follow the format in the book, then make the final exam more of a practical exam that is a small adventure of its own.
- Additional NPC Ideas:
	- Rob Guthrie - Lorehold grad student (chaos), who's depressed, and hangs out at the tavern all the time.
	- Matt Drwenski - Lorehold grad student (order), who's depressed, and hangs out at the tavern all the time.
	- Crazy Street Preacher - just anti-magic generally, yelling at the students
	- Professor who likes to go to student parties
	- The cool guy who doesn't even go to school here, but is dating someone there and just hangs around (a dragonborn in a leather jacket ala Johnny Spells).
	- NPCs based on the characters of Community (from the introduction) - remedial teens (Troy), twenty-something drop outs (Britta), middle age divorcees (Shirley), and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity (Pierce), Abed, Jeff, Annie.

#### Act 2

* Everything that happens after the PCs are transported to Khorvaire is the second act. This act is marked by the players being teleported to Khorvaire. None of the PCs can use any magical spells or magic items (although the world around them seems largely normal) until they investigate and address that school of magic (in the appropriate adventure, as outlined below). They encounter a local scholar who reveals that, while no widespread calamities have occurred yet, magic has started behaving strangely in subtle ways.
* The act is structured as a sort of mystery, with five schools of magic being clued as options during each section of the act (separated by plot point funnels). Each node has at least three clues that lead to other adventure nodes as well as the plot point. Ideally, the PCs  will be motivated enough by wanting to get their magic back to visit all of the clued areas, but this should be treated as an open world. The node in the center has the most clues pointing to it (5), and therefore is the most likely location for the PCs to move toward. The nodes on the outside have the least number of clues (3). So the center node should be the school that the most PCs are connected to, and will want to address first (thereby further increasing the chances they find each other quickly).
	* The starting locations, upon landing in Khorvaire, are the first nodes with at least three clues pointing to at least two other locations. So no matter where the PCs land, they'll have options on where to go next (and have a good chance of meeting up in the second group of nodes).
	* The first group of five schools should be the locations in central Khorvaire.
	* The second group of five schools should be the location in outer Khorvaire and other continents.
	* The final three schools are all on Argonnesson, and will need to be tackled roughly sequentially before taking on the finale.
* Malakar and his Oriq, in collaboration with House Tarkanan, are trying to wipe out the different schools of magic by eliminating any master of that school (usually by going back in time and eliminating them from the timeline), or disrupting the education of it through the major academic organization.
	* [[2-02  Abjuration]]: Morgrave University in Sharn, and a city-rampaging combat adventure.
	* [[2-03  Enchantment]]: Askelios in Aundair, with memories modified and alternative lives lived.
	* [[2-04  Evocation]]: Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, and ???
	* [[2-05  Divination]]: The Citadel in Wroat, the King's Dark Lanterns (and Wands), and a pre-cog arrest mystery.
	* [[2-06  Transmutation]]: Mordain the Fleshweaver (Mordain's Hall in Droaam), and a time travel adventure.
	* [[2-07  Conjuration]]: Greenheart in the Eldeen Reaches, Oalian, and a dungeon crawl inside of a living tree.
	* [[2-08  Illusion]]: Pylas Pyrial in Zilargo/Thelanis, The Prince of Frost, and a court intrigue adventure.
	* [[2-09  Necromancy]]: The jungles of Xen'drik, and a necromantic war between two factions.
	* [[2-10  Artifice]]: Lord of Blades, The Mournland, and ???
	* [[2-11  Psionics]]: Nulakesh in Sarlona, and a mental mystery.

* **First Pinch Point**: Some evidence that magic is being drained from the world. As a wide magic world, this may show in the form of basic spells like *[[prestidigitation]]*, that's used everywhere for lots of things, have stopped working. This may occur any time after 1st adventure is completed.
* **Second Plot Point (Midpoint)**: Clear and dramatic demonstration of there being less magic in the world. Magical disaster(s) that serve as key moments of tension - which may include any of these depending on where they players are at this time (after completion of the first five adventures).
	* Towers in Sharn fall from the sky, killing hundreds and sowing chaos.
	* Airships lose control as their elemental rings fail, crashing to the ground.
	* Planar manifest zones destabilize, releasing dangerous energy and creatures.
	* Arcane storms lash the land, unleashing chaotic magical effects.
	* Elementals rebel, attacking their handlers and causing widespread destruction.
	* Khyber dragonshards erupt with corruptive energy, twisting the land around them.
	* Healing spells backfire, causing horrific injuries instead of curing.
	* Graveyards across Khorvaire see uncontrolled undead uprisings.
	* Malfunctioning warforged revert to lifeless constructs or turn hostile.
* **Second Pinch Point**: At each nexus visited, a large dragonshard is found somewhere nearby, embedded in the ground (with a very high Arcana check revealing that it appears to function to channel magic).
* **Third Plot Point**: The PCs learn that the dragonshards they've been finding at each nexus form a sort of sigil, but only learn this because they encounter and are attacked by a group of Oriq who appear to be manipulating the sigil in some way. After the fight, they learn that the sigil is a teleportation device keyed to the dragonshard network, designed to send the players back to Argonnesson. But unfortunately the sigil has been sabotaged by Zaelith and leads directly to their lab instead of Strixhaven.

#### Act 3

* **Climax**: Battle with the BBEG.
* **Resolution**: Return to any professors and students that were important to the PCs during their time at Strixhaven.
* **Epilogue**

- This act is marked by the players' return to Argonnessen. Two additional adventures will be tackled, based on the school practiced by Malakar's lieutenants, before returning to Strixhaven proper to take on the big bad himself.
- [[2-12  Entropomancy]]: Verthicha'vivex in Argonnessen, Zaelith T'Kaarn (Oriq Second Lieutenant), and a planar jaunt.
- [[2-13  Dunamancy]]: Argonnessen, Extus Narr (Oriq First Lieutenant), and a time hopping jaunt?
- [[2-14  Hemomancy (Finale)]]: Strixhaven, Final confrontation with Malakar

### Player-Facing Information

- 

### Introduction and Session Zero

- Opening Quote, and Welcome.
- **Character Creation**. Each player should create a character that has a unique tie to magic. I encourage you to use concepts that you may not have had a chance to up to this point - like dragonmarks, or magic specific to Eberron. Please start thinking about character concepts as I cover the campaign information, and we'll loop back and flesh out each of your character ideas before leaving the session (I would like to have characters set up today).
- **General Campaign Information**.
	- The campaign's central theme is the nature of magic, and its relation to power and life. Please think about what you'd like your character to explore in relation to that theme, and let me know.
	- The campaign will take place in three acts. The first act will take place at Strixhaven University, the second act branches out from Strixhaven to other locations across Eberron, and the third act will be facing off against the BBEG. Most of what we talk about today will be discussing the Strixhaven opening.
- **Strixhaven Mechanics**.
	- **Strixhaven Is a University**. This book’s campaign assumes that the player characters are students at Strixhaven University. Even as they get caught up in the adventures, the characters have to continue going to class, doing homework, and studying for exams. The characters are also subject to the authority of the university’s faculty and staff members. Circumstances will at times cause player characters to defy faculty authority during their adventures, and the threat of detention or even expulsion might hang over their head. Finally, student characters are part of a school community. They live in university housing, eat in dining halls, and spend the majority of their time on campus. They eat, sleep, study, socialize, and adventure as part of a community of students, faculty, and staff. The school is like a town, where a relatively small cast of characters can play significant roles.
	- **It's An Academy of Mages**. Study at Strixhaven isn’t about learning to be a wizard but about learning to be a historian, an artist, an orator, a scientist, or some other profession — while using magic to enhance one’s studies. The university’s understanding of magic is expansive. Characters of any class can study at Strixhaven, whether they’re full-fledged spellcasters like wizards, clerics, and druids; they manage a spell or two thanks to a subclass or feat; or they manifest magical abilities that aren’t even spells. (For example, a barbarian who follows the Path of the Ancestral Guardian, described in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, can excel in studying history at Lorehold College by virtue of their connection to an ancestral spirit.) Magic is everywhere on campus. The campus culture encourages finding magical solutions to the most mundane problems, and if characters need access to a spell they can’t cast, they have a strong chance of finding someone who can cast it.
	- **It's Cosmopolitan**. Strixhaven draws students and faculty from across the world and from other planes. The university’s students and faculty are united by a desire to learn and include humans, elves, dwarves, owlin, orcs, trolls, vampires, and studious folk of many other origins. In practical terms, for player characters, you can use the rules found in any D&D book to select a character’s race. For nonplayer characters, you’re as likely to meet a pixie, a dryad, a giant, a treant, or another fantastical creature on campus as you are to meet a Humanoid. To the faculty and students of Strixhaven, it is unremarkable to meet someone who hails from a far-off land, since almost everyone on campus is from somewhere else. Strixhaven has a place for anyone who is dedicated to magic-enhanced study.
	- **Student Life**. Students at Strixhaven spend their first year in a course of general studies, which lays the foundation for the more specialized work to follow. During this year, they wear a uniform of black, white, and gray. They’re encouraged to study broadly so that they be come acquainted with a wide range of disciplines. First-year students live in dormitories located on the central campus and often form close friendships there that last throughout their educational careers, even when members of tight-knit groups of friends join different colleges in their second year. A few students continue to live on central campus after choosing a college, particularly if they pursue extensive studies in multiple colleges or work as resident advisers to first-year students. But most students move to dormitories located on their chosen college’s campus in their second year.
	- **Relationships**. This campaign has mechanics for tracking relationship with other students and faculty across Strixhaven. These relationships may become Friends, Beloveds, or Rivals throughout the course of your time at the school, granting boons or banes depending on the individual and your relationship with them. During downtime, you can choose to spend time with people or perform other activities.
	- **Extracurriculars**. Extracurriculars — the campus clubs and societies students can join — are a key part of student life at Strixhaven. At any point during your adventures, a character can gain the benefit of two of the Extracurriculars (or one Extracurricular and one Job). While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a Student Die and a Relationship Point. A Job grants a Wage and a Relationship Point.
	- **Exams**. Through the course of your studies at Strixhaven, your skills will be tested in various classes. Each Exam encounter has a Studying phase followed by a Testing phase. In general, a character can approach Studying in any way they desire, with that phase then culminating in a single ability check of their choice. In contrast, Testing requires ability checks using specific skills. Also you can cheat, or use Student Dice to help your rolls.
- **Getting Started**. The players are all given an arcane summons from a magical letter, which includes a teleportation spell taking them straight to Argonnesson.

### DM Notes

* Main concept is the nature of [[Magic]], and its power in the world, using Buddhist/Jainist ideals. **Philosophy**: The pursuit of ultimate power through magic represents a rejection of interdependence, leading to isolation and suffering. This contrasts with the ideal of using magic as a tool to serve others and promote harmony.
* Look into the idea of custom created spells. Could be a fun class or like a "capstone project".
* Use the [[Path of Light]] as the primary organization to drive the story. Turns out their views of magic have been right all along!
* Use mana nexuses as metaphors for chakras — points where energy gathers and flows — requiring balance and restoration to achieve harmony.
* Malakar has the goal to essentially collect all the Mana for himself, turning himself into a god (the first true god of Eberron, higher than the Sovereigns). He's using forbidden blood magic to further his goal, and the Strixhaven Snarl as a conduit to channel the mana. The dragons despise blood magic (especially since it uses dragon blood), and its use was the reason why they destroyed the giants of Xen'drik (who were beginning to practice blood magic).
* The original Oriq were aberrant dragonmark bearers born on Argonnesson. These marks are not random; they are the result of mana reacting to imbalances in the world. When magic is hoarded or twisted (such as through blood magic), the resulting disruptions cause aberrant dragonmarks to manifest in mortals. Malakar’s use of blood magic exacerbates these imbalances, leading to an increase in aberrant dragonmarks across Khorvaire and Argonnesson. He seeks to control and refine these marks, using the chaos they represent to enhance his power and manipulate the flow of mana.
* 
* In the climax of the campaign, the players uncover the true nature of aberrant dragonmarks and their role in the balance of magic. Aberrant dragonmarks are not flaws but safeguards of creation. They emerge when magic becomes too concentrated or hoarded, acting as a release valve for mana’s chaotic energy. This aligns with the campaign’s themes of balance and interdependence. The marks bridge the gap between chaos (as the origin of magic) and order (as its structured application). They are proof that magic cannot be fully controlled or monopolized.
* Possibly have adventures in Act 3 where the players need to manifest their own aberrant dragonmarks in order to take on the Oriq? If going this route, the dragonmarks should play into the final battle in a major way.
