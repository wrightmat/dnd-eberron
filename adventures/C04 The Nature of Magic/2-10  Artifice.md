### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Players' magic items stop working, in addition to their spells, and this adventure restores the magic items.
- Players have to infiltrate a massive factory powered by a magical core. They face traps and puzzles designed by an inventive group of warforged (The Blades) attempting to create new and more inventive warforged models.
- Could take some inspiration from *Tiny Heist* and movies like "Honey I Shrunk the Kids", since the players will be normal size, but everything around them is gigantic.
