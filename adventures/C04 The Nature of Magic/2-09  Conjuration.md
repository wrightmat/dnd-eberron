### Background and Hook(s)

* Oalian, the ancient awakened oak and spiritual guide of the Eldeen Reaches, has grown sick, his once-vast magical powers faltering. Druids report strange anomalies spreading through the forest—summoned creatures appearing unbidden, gateways to other planes opening and closing erratically, and nature itself becoming unstable. Oalian’s condition is tied to conjuration magic, as his roots once served as a stabilizing nexus for planar energies in the Reaches.
* The players are summoned by druids of the Wardens of the Wood to investigate. They discover that Oalian has been corrupted, and the only way to save him is to delve into his heart—literally. The dungeon lies within Oalian’s living body, a surreal environment filled with magical hazards and conjuration-themed challenges.

### Characters and Locations

* **Oalian**. The Great Druid Oalian is recognized as the ultimate authority in the region by all the sects except for the Gatekeepers. The Wardens of the Wood directly serve Oalian and act as his eyes and ears throughout the region.
* **Thalina Mosswind** (female half-elf druid). A leader among the Wardens of the Wood who seeks the players’ help. Thalina provides the ritual to shrink them and guidance about Oalian’s condition.

* **[[Greenheart]], Eldeen Reaches**

### Scenes and Situations

###### Arriving in the Eldeen Reaches
 - [ ] 
- The adventure begins as the players arrive in the Eldeen Reaches, where the forest appears unnaturally distorted.
	- Trees shimmer as though phasing in and out of reality.
	- Strange creatures (conjured elementals, aberrations) roam the woods, attacking indiscriminately.
- The druids of the Wardens of the Wood explain that Oalian has been acting erratically, summoning creatures without control and warping the natural order.
- Oalian’s physical appearance has changed — his bark is cracked and blackened, with glowing sigils of unknown origin.
- The corruption is revealed to be a conjuration parasite, a manifestation of magical instability planted by the Oriq to destabilize the Reaches.

###### Inside the Great Oalian Tree
 - [ ] 
- The druids perform a ritual to shrink the players and allow them to enter Oalian’s body through a hollow in his trunk.
	- Interior Environment: The dungeon is a surreal blend of natural and magical elements:
	- Luminous Sap Rivers: Flowing with radiant energy, they act as both pathways and hazards.
	- Pulsing Roots: Veins of magic thread through the space, summoning hostile creatures or creating temporary barriers.
	- Planar Anomalies: Small rifts to other planes open and close within Oalian, spilling in conjured creatures like mephits, elementals, or fey.

###### Ox. Oalian's Heart 
 - [ ] 
- At the heart of the dungeon lies the source of corruption — a conjuration parasite fused to Oalian’s core. The parasite is a writhing mass of planar energy, pulsing with chaotic conjuration magic. Its tendrils burrow into Oalian’s essence, disrupting his control over summoning.
- The parasite continuously conjures reinforcements, such as planar beasts or corrupted elementals. Players can weaken the parasite by severing its tendrils or using dispelling magic to destabilize its connections. Environmental hazards may include unstable planar rifts that pull players toward dangerous realms (Xoriat).
	- Need to create a custom monster stat block for this (or look for something cool in Tome of Beasts).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Inspired by the Great Deku Tree from Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but in a five-room dungeon format.
- To incorporate into the dungeon:
	- Summoning Nodes: Corrupted nodes along Oalian’s roots continuously summon hostile creatures (e.g., earth elementals, aberrant fey). Players must find ways to disrupt the summoning—either by destroying the nodes, completing a ritual, or cutting off the magical flow.
	- Living Puzzles: Parts of Oalian’s body require interaction to navigate, such as:
		- Animating Roots: Players must lure summoned creatures into breaking through barriers of tangled roots.
		- Sap Current Puzzle: Redirect glowing sap flows to stabilize an unstable area, using Insight, Arcana, or creative teamwork.
