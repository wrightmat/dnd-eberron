### Background and Hook(s)

* The dragon totems are not just statues; they are temporal anchors, used by the dragons to observe the past and future. Each totem corresponds to a moment in history, allowing powerful seers to witness events without interfering. However, someone has begun tampering with the totems, attempting to rewrite history itself.

### Characters and Locations

* **Extus Narr** (male human dunamancy warlock). Malakar's first lieutenant, who has been corrupting time and wiping out schools of magic.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Maybe some final time-hopping adventure, where we can visit various times/locations such as the Last War and other important events?
- Could also tie together time and death, and have vignettes with each of the characters as they see their own deaths and decide how to handle the scene. See Dimension 20 Season 11 (The Seven) Episode 9 (Time and Space).
