### Background and Hook(s)

* The dragon totems are not just statues; they are temporal anchors, used by the dragons to observe the past and future. Each totem corresponds to a moment in history, allowing powerful seers to witness events without interfering. However, someone has begun tampering with the totems, attempting to rewrite history itself.
* After all of the time periods have been visited, the dragonshard that Extus used to escape is found that leads the party to a showdown with the first lieutenant.

### Characters and Locations

* **Extus Narr** (male human dunamancy warlock). Malakar's first lieutenant, who has been corrupting time and wiping out schools of magic.

* **Totem Beach, Argonnessen**.

### Scenes and Situations

###### Introduction
 - [ ] 
- When the players arrive, they see Extus Narr completing some sort of spell, and all of the dragon totems rise from the beach and begin floating. Before they can get there or even react, Extus snatches a glowing dragonshard being held by one of the statues, and disappears.
- Some Seren tribe members could be here to provide some background information, but none of them would know what's going on now or what to do.
- If a player touches a glowing dragonshard, they are all transported to one of the scenes below (choose at random or roll for it).
- Each time the players enter a vision, they experience three phases:
	- Establishing the Scene. Read the initial description aloud.
	- Points of Interest. List out the specific things that stand out in the scene, so the players can choose which to engage with (each can choose their own interest).
	- Player-Driven Engagement. Players make a skill check based on the point of interest chosen, and on a success gain additional information from the scene about something relevant to one of them or the campaign as a whole.

###### 1. The Day of Mourning (Evocation)
 - [ ] 
- **Initial Description**
>The streets of Metrol stretch before you, filled with people in a growing panic. The sky darkens as a massive sphere of shimmering blue-violet energy expands from the city’s heart, consuming everything in its path. Buildings crack and collapse, stone crumbling into dust as the wave of destruction spreads. The air is thick with the sound of desperate cries and the unnatural hum of unstable magic.

- **Focal Points**
	- The center of the explosion pulses erratically, shifting in unnatural patterns as it expands (_Perception, Insight_)
		- DC 12: The blue-violet energy is reminiscent of the snarl at the center of the Strixhaven Biblioplex.
	- A group of civilians flee through the streets (_Investigation, Medicine_)
		- DC 12: Among them, Cosset’s owners, the Theris family, are visible — they were alive up until the final moment.
		- DC 15: With a quick count, you realize one of the children isn't with the family.
	- A cloaked figure stands still at the edge of the destruction, watching the devastation (_History, Religion_)
		- DC 15: The cloaked figure is wearing a mask that's familiar as that of the Oriq.

###### 2. The Marking of the First Aberrant (Enchantment)
 - [ ] 
- **Initial Description**
>A dimly lit cavern stretches before you, its walls slick with condensation. At its center, an elven youth writhes on the ground, clutching their arm as a twisting, pulsing mark etches itself into their skin. The glow illuminates a circle of somber-faced dragons watching from the shadows, their golden eyes cold and judgmental. The air hums with restrained power, thick with the weight of something ancient and final.

- **Focal Points**
	- The elven youth thrashing on the ground, their dragonmark burning bright (Medicine, Insight)
		- DC 12: The mark is not stable — it is shifting as if resisting a predefined form.
		- DC 15: This mark looks eerily similar to modern aberrant dragonmarks, yet more fluid, like it could have evolved into something else.
	- The gathered dragons, watching in silence (Perception, History)
		- DC 12: Most of the dragons appear impassive, but one — an elder with deep sapphire scales — seems uneasy, their gaze flickering between the mark and something unseen.
		- DC 15: The sapphire dragon has a similar mark, though hidden beneath faint shifting scales, as if suppressing it.
	- The cavern walls, etched with runes faintly glowing in response to the event (Investigation, Religion)
		- DC 12: The runes are ancient Draconic, describing the first recorded cases of dragonmarks.
		- DC 15: One passage is partially erased — mentioning an alternative outcome for those who bear this mark.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Maybe some final time-hopping adventure, where we can visit various times/locations such as the Last War and other important events?
- Could also tie together time and death, and have vignettes with each of the characters as they see their own deaths and decide how to handle the scene. See Dimension 20 Season 11 (The Seven) Episode 9 (Time and Space).
