### Background and Hook(s)

* The dragon totems are not just statues; they are temporal anchors, used by the dragons to observe the past and future. Each totem corresponds to a moment in history, allowing powerful seers to witness events without interfering. However, someone has begun tampering with the totems, attempting to rewrite history itself.
* After all of the time periods have been visited, the dragonshard that Extus used to escape is found that leads the party to a showdown with the first lieutenant back on Totem Beach.

### Characters and Locations

* **Extus Narr** (male human dunamancy warlock). Malakar's first lieutenant, who has been corrupting time and wiping out schools of magic.

* **Totem Beach, Argonnessen**.

### Scenes and Situations

###### Introduction
 - [ ] 
- When the players arrive, they see Extus Narr completing some sort of spell, and all of the dragon totems rise from the beach and begin floating. Before they can get there or even react, Extus snatches a glowing dragonshard being held by one of the statues, and disappears.
- Some Seren tribe members could be here to provide some background information, but none of them would know what's going on now or what to do.
- If a player touches a glowing dragonshard, they are all transported to one of the scenes below (choose at random or roll for it).
- Each time the players enter a vision, they experience three phases:
	- Establishing the Scene. Read the initial description aloud.
	- Points of Interest. List out the specific things that stand out in the scene, so the players can choose which to engage with (each can choose their own interest).
	- Player-Driven Engagement. Players make a skill check based on the point of interest chosen, and on a success gain additional information from the scene about something relevant to one of them or the campaign as a whole.

###### 1. The Day of Mourning
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>The streets of Metrol stretch before you, filled with people in a growing panic. The sky darkens as a massive sphere of shimmering blue-violet energy expands from the city’s heart, consuming everything in its path. Buildings crack and collapse, stone crumbling into dust as the wave of destruction spreads. The air is thick with the sound of desperate cries and the unnatural hum of unstable magic.

**Focal Points**
- The center of the explosion pulses erratically, shifting in unnatural patterns as it expands (_Perception, Insight_)
	- DC 10: The blue-violet energy is reminiscent of the snarl at the center of the Strixhaven Biblioplex.
- A group of civilians flee through the streets (_Investigation, Medicine_)
	- DC 10: Among them, Cosset’s owners, the Theris family, are visible — they were alive up until the final moment.
	- DC 15: With a quick count, you realize one of the children isn't with the family.
- A cloaked figure stands still at the edge of the destruction, watching the devastation (_History, Religion_)
	- DC 15: The cloaked figure is wearing a mask that's familiar as that of the Oriq.

###### 2. The Marking of the First Aberrant
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A dimly lit cavern stretches before you, its walls slick with condensation. At its center, an elven youth writhes on the ground, clutching their arm as a twisting, pulsing mark etches itself into their skin. The glow illuminates a circle of somber-faced dragons watching from the shadows, their golden eyes cold and judgmental. The air hums with restrained power, thick with the weight of something ancient and final.

**Focal Points**
- The elven youth thrashing on the ground, their dragonmark burning bright (_Medicine, Insight_)
	- DC 10: The mark is not stable — it is shifting as if resisting a predefined form.
	- DC 15: This mark looks eerily similar to modern aberrant dragonmarks, yet more fluid, like it could have evolved into something else.
- The gathered dragons, watching in silence (_Perception, History_)
	- DC 10: Most of the dragons appear impassive, but one — an elder with deep sapphire scales — seems uneasy, their gaze flickering between the mark and something unseen.
	- DC 15: The sapphire dragon has a similar mark, though hidden beneath faint shifting scales, as if suppressing it.
- The cavern walls, etched with runes faintly glowing in response to the event (_Investigation, Religion_)
	- DC 10: The runes are ancient Draconic, describing the first recorded cases of dragonmarks.
	- DC 15: One passage is partially erased — mentioning an alternative outcome for those who bear this mark.

###### 3. The Death of the First Lich
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>An ancient stone temple looms before you, its walls covered in faded sigils. The air is thick with the scent of burning incense and something more acrid—rotting flesh. At the altar, a human sorcerer kneels within a circle of flickering violet light, his body trembling as dark energy flows through him. Hooded figures stand in silent reverence, their faces obscured. Beyond the temple walls, a storm rages, the sky pulsing in time with the ritual.

**Focal Points**
- The sorcerer kneeling in the ritual circle, deathly pale (_Medicine, Insight_)
    - DC 10: His breathing is labored, his veins darkening as something unnatural takes hold.
    - DC 15: His soul is being severed from his body — this is not just transformation, it is self-inflicted death.
- The hooded figures surrounding him, whispering in an ancient tongue (_Perception, Religion_)
    - DC 10: Their words invoke a plea to Mabar, the Endless Night, yet also something older, something unrecorded in divine texts.
    - DC 15: One figure clutches a symbol of the Blood of Vol, though subtly altered from the modern version.
- The sigils inscribed into the stone altar, pulsing faintly (_Investigation, History_)
    - DC 10: The inscriptions describe a ritual meant to transcend death, marking the first recorded attempt at undeath.
    - DC 15: One section details a failed predecessor — a name erased, a warning scratched over the text.

###### 4. The Gatekeepers and the Xoriat Invasion
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A dense swamp stretches before you, its trees twisted into unnatural shapes, their roots writhing as if alive. The sky above is fractured, revealing glimpses of impossible landscapes — floating, shifting, dissolving in and out of existence. At the heart of the mire, a massive stone circle hums with power, its runes glowing with urgent energy. A group of Gatekeeper druids stands in formation, chanting in unison, their leader driving a massive dragonshard staff into the ground as waves of green light pulse outward. From the edges of the clearing, the first aberrations emerge — eyes where there should be mouths, limbs bending at impossible angles.

**Focal Points**
- The Gatekeeper leader, standing at the center of the ritual (_History, Insight_)
	- DC 10: He is one of the first Gatekeepers, leading the ritual that will seal Xoriat away.
	- DC 15: He wields a staff inlaid with a Khyber dragonshard, known for its magical sealing abilities.
- The glowing runes forming the seal around the ritual site (_Religion, Investigation_)
	- DC 10: The runes form a binding spell, meant to sever Xoriat’s connection to the Material Plane.
	- DC 15: These runes match those used in modern magical seals — this knowledge has not been entirely lost and could still be used today.
- The aberrations emerging from the rift, shifting and twisting (_Nature, Medicine_)
	- DC 10: These creatures are not mindless — they hesitate when facing the druids’ magic, reacting with something close to fear.
	- DC 15: Some of them bear marks that resemble modern aberrant dragonmarks, suggesting a connection between the aberrations and those touched by Xoriat.

###### 5. The Fall of the Titan Kings
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A city of impossibly tall spires looms before you, built on a scale meant for giants. Its towering structures are etched with glowing runes, their light flickering as the air grows heavy with the scent of fire and ash. Overhead, dragons wheel through the sky, their roars shaking the very earth. Below, giant mages scramble to complete a ritual, their booming voices filled with desperation. A golden dragon, the size of a castle, descends toward the city, its breath igniting the skyline.

**Focal Points**
- The giant mages working frantically on a spell (_Investigation, Arcana_)
    - DC 10: The giants are using rune-magic similar to that found in modern artificer techniques, suggesting a direct lineage between their knowledge and current arcane practices.
    - DC 15: They are not trying to destroy the dragons but to seal something beneath the city, using a spell that involves Khyber dragonshards.
- The golden dragon leading the attack (_History, Religion_)
    - DC 10: This is Ourelonastrix, one of the greatest dragons of Argonnessen, leading the assault to end the giant civilization.
    - DC 15: He does not look triumphant — his expression is grim and filled with regret, as though this destruction is not entirely by choice.
- A strange monolith in the center of the city (_Perception, Nature_)
    - DC 10: The monolith radiates an immense magical presence, pulsing in time with the giants' ritual.
    - DC 15: Its magic feels oddly familiar — the energy is similar to the **nexus points the players have been restoring**, meaning this site could have been one of the first.

###### 6. The First Planar Binding
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A massive stone chamber stretches before you, its walls covered in intricate carvings of creatures from across the planes. At the center, a ritual circle glows with pulsing energy. A couatl hovers above it, its iridescent wings outstretched, chanting in a resonant, musical voice. Across from it, a towering fiend stands motionless, its eyes locked onto the couatl. A group of humanoid scholars and druids watch in tense silence, some clutching ancient scrolls, others holding weapons as if expecting a battle.

**Focal Points**
- The couatl leading the ritual (_History, Religion_)
    - DC 10: The couatl’s words are not a spell of destruction but a binding, calling upon the power of the Silver Flame to contain the fiend.
    - DC 15: This is the first recorded use of planar binding magic, the origins of summoning and warding spells that are still in use today.
- The fiend standing within the ritual circle (_Insight, Perception_)
    - DC 10: The fiend does not resist the ritual — it is waiting, studying the couatl, as though understanding its fate.
    - DC 15: The fiend is smiling, as if it knows something the others do not. This binding may not be as permanent as the couatl believes.
- The carvings along the chamber walls (_Investigation, Nature_)
    - DC 10: The carvings depict a history of conflicts between mortals and planar beings, showing past attempts to control extraplanar forces.
    - DC 15: One carving at the far end of the chamber shows something different—a mortal with glowing eyes, standing between planes, suggesting that at least one human once wielded the power to cross between them freely.

###### 7. The Ritual That Created the First Warforged
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A cavernous forge glows with molten light, the air thick with the scent of hot metal and alchemical fumes. A massive assembly of arcane machinery hums with energy, a series of interconnected rings spinning around a single metal form suspended in the center. House Cannith artificers in soot-streaked robes move with urgency, adjusting runes and infusing dragonshards. A human overseer stands at the controls, his fingers gripping the edge of a console as if hesitating before taking the final step.

**Focal Points**
- The suspended warforged body at the center of the forge (_Investigation, Medicine_)
	- DC 10: The form is incomplete — there is no soul yet bound to it.
	- DC 15: The bindings include an experimental integration of planar magic, suggesting Cannith drew inspiration from sources beyond their own traditions.
- The human overseer at the controls (_Insight, History_)
	- DC 10: His expression is uncertain — he is considering something, but none of the artificers around him seem to notice.
	- DC 15: He mutters under his breath about "the cost of true sentience," implying he understands this act is creating something more than just a construct.
- The surrounding machinery and arcane inscriptions (_Perception, Nature_)
	- DC 10: The sigils inlaid across the forge bear resemblance to those used in elemental binding, a technique most commonly seen in the construction of airships.
	- DC 15: The inscriptions include reference to something called "The Divine Spark," a term that is not present in any modern Cannith records.

###### 8. The Mark of Prophecy’s First Appearance
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A lone mountaintop rises above a storm-wracked landscape, its jagged cliffs overlooking an endless expanse of mist. At its peak, a human child kneels within a glowing circle of shifting symbols, their expression one of quiet awe. A group of dragons, their scales shimmering with arcane power, watch from a distance, their tails coiled in tense stillness. High above, a massive ring of golden light pulses in the sky, forming intricate patterns that shift too quickly to follow.

**Focal Points**
- The child at the center of the ritual, staring at their own hands (_Medicine, Insight_)
	- DC 10: The glowing sigils are not carved or inked — they shift and move across their skin, forming intricate shapes before dissolving and reforming.
	- DC 15: The child does not appear afraid but is mouthing something silently — on closer observation, they are speaking Draconic, though they should be too young to know the language.
- The gathered dragons watching from a distance (_Perception, History_)
	- DC 10: They are not performing the ritual — this is not their doing. They are observing, not acting, as if awaiting confirmation of something.
	- DC 15: One dragon shifts uneasily, its talons gripping the stone. It has a similar sigil carved into its scales, though old and faded, suggesting this has happened before.
- The shifting symbols in the sky above the mountaintop (_Investigation, Religion_)
	- DC 10: The patterns resemble sections of the Draconic Prophecy found in ancient texts, but they are changing in real time, as if new prophecy is being written in this moment.
	- DC 15: These symbols are not just foretelling events — they are reacting to the presence of the child, suggesting prophecy is not entirely predetermined but can be influenced.

###### 9. The Moment Malakar Chose His Path
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A ruined temple stands in the middle of a scorched valley, its cracked pillars covered in faded draconic script. The air is thick with the scent of blood. At the temple’s altar, a dragonborn kneels, his hands stained red as he carves intricate patterns into his own scales. A heavy tome lies open before him, its pages flickering with arcane symbols. A second figure stands nearby, cloaked in shadow, their face obscured. The only sound is the dragonborn’s steady, controlled breathing as he presses his bleeding hands to the altar.

**Focal Points**
- Malakar kneeling at the altar, his hands outstretched (_Insight, Medicine_)
	- DC 10: His wounds are not random — each cut follows precise patterns, forming runes similar to those found in old blood magic rituals.
	- DC 15: His breathing is slow and controlled, as if he has done this before. This is not an act of desperation but a deliberate step toward something greater.
- The tome lying open on the altar (_Investigation, History_)
	- DC 10: The pages describe a ritual to consume the power of others, a foundational principle of blood magic.
	- DC 15: The text is not just theoretical — it contains notes in Malakar’s own handwriting, refining the spell over time. This is not the first time he has attempted something like this.
- The cloaked figure standing in the shadows (_Perception, Religion_)
	- DC 10: The figure does not interfere, only watching. They are waiting for the ritual to complete.
	- DC 15: The robed figure is also wearing a distinct mask, an unmistakable symbol of the Oriq, suggesting he was not alone in discovering this path.

###### 10. The Future – The Sky Turns Red
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A battlefield stretches before you, littered with the ruins of once-great cities. The sky is a deep crimson, streaked with black fissures that pulse with arcane energy. Dragons and mortals alike fight in the air and on the ground, their spells and weapons clashing in a war unlike any recorded in history. In the distance, a massive spire of dragonshards hums with raw power, its presence distorting the land around it. Among the chaos, figures that resemble the party move through the battlefield—older, hardened, and wearing unfamiliar armor.

**Focal Points**
- The battlefield and warring factions (_Perception, History_)
    - DC 10: This is not just a war — it is a collapse of reality itself, as if something is unraveling the very fabric of magic.
    - DC 15: The factions are not as clear-cut as dragons vs. mortals. Some dragons fight alongside humanoids, while others turn against their own kind.
- The dragonshard spire at the center of the war (_Investigation, Nature_)
    - DC 10: The energy radiating from the spire is similar to the magic being drained from Khorvaire — it is a focal point of immense power.
    - DC 15: The structure resembles the snarls they have encountered before, but this one appears to be fully under someone’s control.
- The future versions of the party (_Insight, Religion_)
    - DC 10: Each version moves with purpose, as if they have already accepted their fate in this war.
    - DC 15: At least one of them is missing, their absence unspoken but deeply felt by the others.

###### 11. The Future – Their Own Deaths
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A cold silence surrounds you. The world is dim, colorless, and without sound — only the distant murmur of something unseen. Before you, each of you sees a different scene, separate yet parallel. You are no longer observers of history but witnesses to something more personal. These are the moments where your paths end.

**Focal Points**
- The circumstances of your death (_Insight, Investigation_)
    - DC 10: The details are not perfectly clear, shifting slightly when focused on, as if fate has not fully settled.
    - DC 15: Shear
	    - You stand at the heart of the inferno, surrounded by twisted, corrupted creatures. The ancient trees scream as they wither, their spirits torn apart by an unseen force. You fight alone, your form shifting between animal and metal, but the flames keep coming. A single figure stands beyond the fire — indistinct, watching. As the forest collapses, you take one final step forward before the vision fades.
	- DC 15: Alton
		- The battlefield is still, the clash of blades and magic fading into silence. You kneel amid the ruins of a fortress, a shattered greatsword in your hands, blood pooling at your feet. The faces of the fallen blur together, their names lost in the haze. A shadow moves toward you — someone you once trusted, their weapon raised, hesitation flickering for only a moment before they drive the blade home. You do not resist.
	- DC 15: Zsehissu
		- The contract is complete. Another body crumples to the floor, its final breath slipping away into the cold air. You turn, wiping the blood from your blade, but something feels wrong. The room is silent — too silent. The shadows around you shift, figures emerging, their weapons already drawn. They were waiting for you. You reach for your next move, but the strike comes faster than expected, precise and practiced. As darkness overtakes you, the last thing you hear is a voice you recognize, murmuring the words you have spoken to so many others: "It’s nothing personal."
	- DC 15: Hawthorne
		- The struggle is already over by the time you collapse to the stone floor, crimson pooling beneath you. The masked figure stands above you, their blade still slick with your blood, their stance rigid, unreadable. Behind them, others move, their voices distant, speaking words you no longer have the strength to process. But your focus remains on the figure before you, the one who hasn’t yet lowered their weapon. A flash of familiarity cuts through the haze—the curve of a horn, the shape of their stance, the way their breath catches just slightly. As your vision fades, you understand the truth too late.
	- DC 15: Cosset
		- The house is quiet, frozen in time. Toys remain where they were last played with, books left open to stories that will never be finished. The halls stretch on, unchanged, untouched, as if waiting for voices that will never return. You stand in the center of the nursery, and time begins to slip away and lose all meaning. Dust begins to settle over your frame, creeping into the joints of your body, the weight of years pressing down. Your limbs refuse to move. There is no battle, no catastrophe, no final words — only stillness, as the world simply forgets you were ever here.
- The presence of others (_Perception, Medicine_)
    - DC 10: Some of you die alone, others surrounded by figures whose faces are obscured. One of them seems familiar.
    - DC 15: Someone is holding your hand in your final moments. They are speaking, but their words are muffled, as if not yet written.
- The final sensation before the vision fades (_Religion, Nature_)
    - DC 10: There is no overwhelming pain, only acceptance, as if this moment had already been lived before.
    - DC 15: The moment stretches beyond time — you feel something watching, waiting, but whether it is a force of judgment or understanding is unclear.

###### 12. The Future – First Mortal to Become a God
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>A vast chamber stretches before you, its ceiling lost in shadow. The air hums with overwhelming magical energy, raw and uncontained. At the center of the chamber, a lone figure stands within a massive arcane circle, surrounded by swirling motes of golden light. Their arms are outstretched, their body levitating as waves of magic surge through them. A group of onlookers—mages, priests, and scholars—watch in stunned silence as the transformation unfolds. The energy converges, then explodes outward, and when the light fades, the mortal is gone. In their place, something greater stands.

**Focal Points**
- The figure undergoing the transformation (_Insight, Religion_)
	- DC 10: Their body is changing, but it is not being reshaped by external forces — this transformation is coming from within.
	- DC 15: The energy surrounding them is not divine in origin but drawn from the raw fabric of magic itself.
- The arcane circle on the floor (_Investigation, History_)
	- DC 10: The runes bear similarities to modern apotheosis rituals, but this predates any recorded attempts at ascension.
	- DC 15: Some of the markings resemble the energy patterns of snarls, suggesting a connection between divine power and the raw force of magic.
- The reaction of the onlookers (_Perception, Medicine_)
	- DC 10: Some look awed, while others seem terrified, as if they were not expecting the ritual to succeed.
	- DC 15: One among them subtly backs away, as if realizing too late that they may have made a mistake in allowing this to happen.

###### The Battle with Extus Narr
 - [ ] 
- The final battle for this adventure should take place on the Totem Beach, surrounded by the dragon totems. Maybe they can play a role somehow?
- Extus's tactics should focus on shifting the battlefield as much as possible using dunamancy magic. Maybe even reversing gravity and sending things into the sky to create a crazy, dynamic battlefield!
- At the midpoint of the battle (half HP for Extus), the scene below should happen.
- Phase 1: Optional Floating Platforms
	- Extus causes the dragon totems to float in the air and flip upside down, creating floating platforms that the players can choose to use to their advantage. This also alludes to future battle phases.
- Phase 2: Gravity Inversion – Fighting Upside Down
	- Extus reverses gravity, sending himself and all combatants into the sky, where additional floating platforms now act as the battlefield.
	- Any creatures that fail a saving throw are flung upwards until they grab onto something (Athletics/Acrobatics check).
	- Spells with projectile trajectories may function differently, bending due to shifting gravitational pull.
- Phase 3: Chaotic Gravity – Constantly Shifting Directions
	- Extus, now more unstable, begins shifting gravity in different directions every round.
	- The battlefield moves horizontally, diagonally, and even rotates, forcing players to constantly reposition.
	- At this point, Extus fights more aggressively, trying to break the party’s formation and send them into hazards.
- Phase 4: Singularity Collapse – The Final Gambit
	- Extus, realizing he is losing, creates an unstable singularity, pulling all combatants toward its center.
	- Floating platforms crumble, forcing players to rely on midair combat or last-second positioning.
	- This phase is a desperate struggle, where one final strike can determine the battle’s outcome.

###### 13. The Hidden Vision – The Shadow Beyond Time
 - [ ] 
**Initial Description**
>The totems hum louder than before. The air around you feels thick, pressing down as if the weight of reality itself has grown heavier. Something is wrong.
>The world fractures. Light and color drain away, leaving only shifting darkness. You are nowhere and everywhere at once, suspended in a void that stretches beyond comprehension. The air carries no sound, only a presence—something vast, watching, aware.
>Extus Narr stands beside you. His usual confidence is gone, his eyes darting around as if searching for something familiar. His breath comes in short, uneven gasps. "This isn’t right," he mutters. "This... this wasn’t supposed to happen."
>From the shifting dark, a shape moves, not in any direction but through existence itself. A voice speaks, though it does not come from any one place. It is not a sound but a weight settling into your mind.
>"You do not belong here. And yet, here you stand."

**Focal Points**
- The presence moving through the void (Insight, Religion)
    - DC 10: This entity is not a god or a mortal force. It is something older, beyond magic and time.
    - DC 15: This is Mother Void, the mother of the Endless, a being that exists outside fate itself.
- The shifting space around you (Investigation, Perception)
    - DC 10: The void is not empty. It pulses, as though aware of you, reacting to your presence.
    - DC 15: The darkness is not absence but potential, raw creation before it is shaped into reality.
- Extus Narr’s reaction (History, Nature)
    - DC 10: Extus is truly shaken, more than you have ever seen him. He is not in control here.
    - DC 15: His magic does not work in this place. He is unable to manipulate time, as if the concept itself does not exist here.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Maybe some final time-hopping adventure, where we can visit various times/locations such as the Last War and other important events?
- Could also tie together time and death, and have vignettes with each of the characters as they see their own deaths and decide how to handle the scene. See Dimension 20 Season 11 (The Seven) Episode 9 (Time and Space).
