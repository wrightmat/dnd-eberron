 #adventure 

### Background and Hook(s)

* The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom’s faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm’s effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.
* Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor’s waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by Murgaxor Grenshel, the villain the characters will likely face at the end of this year. Murgaxor intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

### Characters and Locations

* **Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III** (N male human first-year student). Quentillius approaches all his endeavors with the utmost seriousness. He believes one should either do something correctly or not at all.
	* **Voice**: Medium-pitched, Slow-paced, Formal (polished, deliberate), Rhythmic (musical cadence or patterned), Grandiose (sweeping gestures, puffed chest).
* **Rubina Larkingdale** (LN human first-year student). When Rubina walks into a room, people take notice. A measured performer with gravitas beyond her years, Rubina is a valued member of the Playactors Drama Guild who can handle weightier roles that more melodramatic actors can’t.
	* **Voice**: High-pitched, Medium-paced, Sweet (soothing, charming), Repetitive phrases ('You know,' 'I mean'), Nervous (wrings hands, shuffles feet).
* **Professor Johenne Totsky** (N human Silverquill professor of shadow). Theatrical director in charge of managing the Rose Stage and its performances on the Silverquill College campus of Strixhaven University. A lover of theatre who is immaculately dressed, Totsky was a talented inkcaster in her day. She is quite superstitious.
	* **Voice**: Medium-pitched, Slow-paced, Warm (friendly, inviting), Pauses (frequently stops mid-sentence), Relaxed (slouched, casual stance).
* **Murgaxor Grenshel** (NE male bullywug). Murgaxor is a bullywug who attended Strixhaven 200 years ago. He was a member of Witherbloom College, though there are no records of him participating in any activities or working on campus. A mean-spirited, egotistical spellcaster, Murgaxor was censured repeatedly for disregarding safety protocols, hexing and cursing peers, and using harmful magic while on campus. University officials believe Murgaxor began his illicit experiments with life-draining magic shortly after he enrolled as a student. In his third year, Murgaxor was expelled for using life-draining magic when it resulted in another student’s death. Murgaxor fled before he could be handed over to authorities. For a few years after his expulsion, Murgaxor was reportedly sighted around the outskirts of campus, specifically in Sedgemoor and Wiltroot Hall. Authorities believed something about those locations enhanced his magic, but he was never caught. Sightings soon stopped, and no further evidence of Murgaxor’s presence was found. Officials assumed he was dead and struck Murgaxor from Strixhaven’s records, as they considered him a blot on the university’s reputation. In reality, Murgaxor is one of Malakar Draksang's primary followers, and has been growing his power (and therefore Malakar's) by draining the life of animals across the swamp, while also coordinating the activity of mage hunters to cause problems across campus.
	* **Voice**: Low-pitched, Slow-paced, Sinister (menacing, sly), Drawled (slow and exaggerated syllables), Menacing (narrowed eyes, furrowed brows).

* **Captain Dapplewing’s Manor**
* **The Rose Stage**
* **Sedgemoor**
* **Wiltroot Hall**

### Scenes and Situations

The scenes below are broken out into the adventures from the Strixhaven book (Chapter 3, second half), organized into weeks appropriate to fill an entire academic semester. On the "off weeks" from what's presented here, downtime activities are happening for each of the players, so ask what they're doing between these scenes. Classes are presumed to be happening during the entire course of the semester, and exams are only called out for the sake of mechanics.

#### Week 16: Campus Daredevils

###### Introduction
 - [ ] 
- A few weeks after their second Magical Physiologies Exam, on the first day back from midterm break, a student the characters have interacted with before (or a random student) rushes up to one of the characters, stuffs a handwritten note into their grasp, winks, and dashes away. The note is crumpled and slightly damp. It reads:
>“Big heroes on campus! You’re the talk of the school, what with your monster-dispatching ways. But can you recover the legendary Sassy Sally Jane? Many have tried. All have failed. Meet us outside Captain Dapplewing’s Manor at midnight tonight and see if you’ve got what it takes!”

- The note isn’t signed, but will be later revealed as coming from a student the characters know.
- The characters have several hours before their peers are expecting them at midnight, so allow them to prepare for this outing any way they wish. Provide them with the following information, and then when they’re ready, go to the “Recover Sassy Sally Jane” section below.

- The talk of the campus for decades, Sassy Sally Jane is a pink-haired doll in a patchwork tartan dress. Inside the doll is a voice box that some clever students rigged to repeat rumors about other students whenever the doll’s hand is squeezed. Jokesters used it to irritate faculty and staff members extensively before it was confiscated. The doll has sat in the attic of Captain Dapplewing’s Manor ever since, alongside other broken, malfunctioning, or forbidden items.
- Captain Dapplewing’s manor house is used as a learning annex by esteemed dual-college faculty members and their favored students.
- A two-story home, the house is located on the central campus and serves as both faculty offices and the setting for lavish dinner parties and intellectual gatherings. A character knows all the information in the “Captain Dapplewing’s Manor” section later in this adventure with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (History) check.

###### Recover Sassy Sally Jane
 - [ ] 
- Once the characters are prepared, they can make their way to Captain Dapplewing’s Manor. It’s easy to find on the central campus, since a well-lit path leads right up to the house, and a few students are milling around outside. Once they notice the characters heading their way, these students get visibly excited.
- Another student is part of this scene — ideally a student the characters have interacted with, or another random student. When you’re ready to begin this event, read or paraphrase the following:
>As the bright light of the central campus fades into the verdant grounds of Captain Dapplewing’s Manor, you see a small group of your peers congregated underneath a massive oak tree in the manor’s front yard.

- One student turns to another and says in a stage whisper, “I told you they’d arrive! Now pay up, you goof!” Turning to the characters, the student points to the manor house and says:
>“This is it. Sassy Sally Jane is up there in the attic. For years, people have tried to liberate her. For years, they’ve failed. But we think this year is different. This year, you’re on campus.”
>“You’re looking for a pink-haired doll wearing a patchwork tartan dress. Now, go in there and become campus legends. If you can bring her back, we’ll all pay for your lunches for a week. No, for a month!”

- If the characters are hesitant to take this dare, a student with whom a character has at least 1 Relationship Point approaches them. The student misses their younger brother terribly and has decided that Sassy Sally Jane would make an excellent gift. The student offers the characters a [[driftglobe]] in exchange for retrieving Sassy Sally Jane and giving them the doll.

###### Captain Dapplewing’s Manor
 - [ ] 
- Tucked at the end of a leafy path on the central campus, Captain Dapplewing’s Manor is a quiet relaxation spot for elite faculty as well as a place of academic meditation and counseling for their students. The manor dates to the earliest days of Strixhaven, when the owlin mage and military veteran Captain Raymous Dapplewing held faculty appointments in both Lorehold and Silverquill Colleges. Wanting a quiet place to retire in the evenings — and to host lavish dinner-parties-turned-colloquiums — the professor used his significant military pension to build this manor house on campus.
- Upon his death, Captain Dapplewing bequeathed the manor to the university, which honored his legacy by giving the house his name and keeping most of its original furnishings in pristine condition. The house’s upper-floor libraries were converted into offices for esteemed dual-college faculty members, and those faculty members meet here with students on academic matters during the day. In the evenings, the manor is the site of dinner parties and elegant cocktail hours for those faculty members, their most promising students, and visiting alumni.
- Since no one permanently lives in Captain Dapplewing’s Manor, the building is closed and locked from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. Because it holds many valuable antiques and volumes of sensitive research, security measures are in place in the manor, as described below.
- Once the characters are ready to go, allow them to approach the house in any way they see fit. The easiest way to access the manor is through its locked front doors (area C1), although characters could easily try to access the manor via one of the decks at the back (areas C10 and C11).
- **Captain Dapplewing’s Manor Features**. The manor has the following features:
	- **Ceilings**. The ceilings throughout the manor are 20 feet high.
	- **Doors**. The manor’s outside doors (in areas C1, C10, and C11) are locked. A character can pick a lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. Anyone can easily break the glass doors, but doing so summons security (see below). The inside doors are unlocked unless otherwise noted.
	- **Lighting**. By night, the interior of the manor is in darkness.
	- **Magic Stairs**. Stairs and steps in the manor are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility.
	- **Transport Circles**. A runic circle is painted on the floor near each staircase in the manor, as well as at the top and bottom of the steps leading inside the building in area C1. These circles are permanent, customized teleportation circles. Anyone can move onto a circle and mentally focus on the floor to which they wish to travel. (The circle leading to the attic is in the manor’s hidden staircase, which must be found first.) When a character is teleported from a circle near a staircase, they arrive on the destination floor on the runic circle nearest the corresponding staircase. The circle outside the main entrance automatically transports characters directly in front of the manor’s front doors.
	- **Security**. If an outside door is smashed or the characters engage in noticeable vandalism, a Silverquill professor of radiance and a Quandrix professor of substance arrive at the manor in `dice:1d4` rounds. Both are serving as campus security for the night and deal with the characters as noted below.
- If the characters are on their best behavior, avoiding combat and trying not to break anything, they should be able to have fun in this event without worrying about lasting damage to the manor. All the Constructs here (including the Earl and the dragon heads plaque) have a self-restoring quality that allows them to repair damage taken during a skirmish. But if characters egregiously smash open doors or engage in property damage, impose repercussions even if their mission to retrieve Sassy Sally Jane is successful.

> [!warning] The Jig is Up!
> If the characters alert security to their unauthorized presence at the manor, they are caught when the professors arrive. The professors force the characters to return to their dormitories, but the characters are free to undertake this mission another night. If they’re caught more than once, the characters must attend special behavioral classes that prevent them from participating in any Extracurriculars or Jobs for the rest of the academic year. The characters immediately lose any benefits from these activities.

###### C1. Veranda
 - [ ] 
>A mahogany roof covers this porch, which is bounded by a low rail and outfitted with fine wicker furniture. Above the double door hangs a sign done in fine calligraphy: “Captain Dapplewing’s Manor.”

- A search of the veranda and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check turns up a key to the front door stashed inside the potted plant. A faculty member who often loses their keys placed this spare here.

###### C2. Foyer
 - [ ] 
>Coat racks carved to resemble statues of individuals line the entryway into the manor beyond. The coat racks flanking the doors depict two dwarves wearing high-collared jackets. The other coat racks on the left depict a one-tusked loxodon, a monocle-wearing orc, and a gnome with a skunk for a hairpiece. The statues on the right depict a drow wearing a scarf, a burly human in a tuxedo, and a high elf in a cowl.

- With successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check, a character recalls that the individuals depicted were Captain Dapplewing’s favorite military compatriots, all great friends of Strixhaven.
- A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the boxy dwarf “coat racks” are moving slightly. Both are designed to serve as attendants and use the duodrone stat block. Without professors to control them, the coat racks attack the characters either when they first notice the coat racks moving or as they move into area C3.

`encounter: 2: Modron Duodrone`

###### C3. Grand Hall
 - [ ] 
>A set of magically shifting steps connects the foyer to this spacious, open area. Beautiful, thick carpet adorns the floor, topped by a crimson runner that leads into the dining hall beyond. From the corner of your eye, you see a formally attired figure.

- Normally a place where people socialize while they wait for dinner, this space is occupied at night by a clockwork butler nicknamed the Earl, which paces back and forth. The Earl wears a silver waistcoat, a black jacket with tails, and a cravat, and it uses the Strixhaven campus guide stat block. Without anyone to correct it, the butler believes the characters are burglars. It shouts a warning in Common — “The Earl commands you to leave!” — before attacking.

`encounter: 1: Strixhaven Campus Guide`

###### C4. Dining Hall
 - [ ] 
>The centerpiece of this hall is a beautifully decorated dining table, its china and silver arranged just so. Along the wall to the west is an upright piano flanked by cushioned benches. To the east stands a fireplace, its embers still glowing.

- The Earl in area C3 sets the table every night before the manor is closed and locked. A character who searches under the table and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a small velvet coin purse someone dropped. Inside is 15 gp.
- The piano is functional and magical. If a character tries to play it, the piano plays an entire jaunty, military-style march. This alerts the Earl in area C3 to the presence of intruders, if the characters have not already encountered the clockwork butler.
- **Treasure**. The fireplace has a number of implements for tending the fire set to one side of it. A character who examines these implements and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers a poker with a silvered end that can be easily removed and used as a silvered dagger.

###### C5. Portrait Salon
 - [ ] 
>This salon features a comfortable sitting area and rows of portraits hung on the walls.

- A character who examines the paintings recognizes that they feature several historical Strixhaven professors, as well as the friends of the university depicted in the coat racks in area C2.

###### C6. Drawing Room
 - [ ] 
>This cozy drawing room holds bookcases as well as a number of easels folded and tucked in beside them. In the northeast corner, an easel holds a watercolor painting of a stylized, chicken-like reptilian creature lounging in a baroque style.

- The painting was created using magic by a talented student as a parlor trick. If a character touches the painting, the creature in the painting disappears and a cockatrice appears beside the character. The confused creature attacks, then winks out of existence when defeated.

`encounter: 1: Cockatrice`

###### C7. Hall of Beauty
 - [ ] 
>This hall is lined with four exquisitely carved marble busts set on gilded pedestals. The abstract busts all represent beautiful androgynous figures bedecked with jewelry carved into its stone — and with a single, twelve-foot-long fur stole wrapped around the shoulders of all four statues.

- A student’s magic trick, the stoles in both these areas each animate into a fire snake if any character moves within 5 feet of the busts. The fire snakes wink out of existence when defeated.

`encounter: 1: Salamander Fire Snake`

###### C8. Kitchen
 - [ ] 
>Pots, pans, cooking utensils, fire pits, and dry goods are tucked into every visible corner of this small kitchen. A pair of crossed sabers hangs above the shelves to the north.

- If anyone tries to steal anything from one of the kitchens, the two sabers in that area animate into two flying swords and attack the thieves. If the characters flee that area, the sabers return to their place on the wall.
- In addition to the visible cooking supplies, the kitchens include cabinets that hold extra silver and china for the dining table in area C4. Any of the knives found here can serve as daggers, though they are branded on one side with the image of an eye patch-wearing owlin and the words “Captain Dapplewing’s Kitchen.”

`encounter: 2: Flying Sword`

###### C9. Curio Room
 - [ ] 
>Cabinets full of curiosities line the northern wall of this room. The strange items on display here include a stuffed pheasant, a sextant dressed as a doll, and a plaque with insects mounted on it. The insects are wearing tiny top hats.

- Flanking the double door leading to area C4 are two shining sets of antique plate armor. If a character touches either set of armor, a random set comes to life as animated armor and attacks. Only one of the suits attacks at a time, and it doesn’t leave the area if the characters flee. However, if the characters leave the area and come back, both suits attack upon their return.

`encounter: 1: Animated Armor`

###### C10. Grand Deck
 - [ ] 
- This spacious deck has a low railing that the characters can easily climb over to access the locked glass door leading into the manor.
- The pots of greenery on either side of this deck are filled with magic vegetation that was recently transplanted and is only loosely rooted. The round after the characters first enter this area, three of these plants attack — two from the pot on the west side of the deck and one from the pot to the east. Each plant uses the violet fungus stat block.

`encounter: 3: Violet Fungus`

###### C11. Side Deck
 - [ ] 
- These smaller side decks each have a low railing that the characters can easily climb over to access the locked glass door leading into manor.
- Bushy magic cacti grow in pots along the manor walls. The cacti have been overwatered recently, so they’re restless and attack anyone who moves into this area. Two cacti on each deck attack, using the needle blight stat block.

`encounter: 2: Needle Blight`

###### C12. Faculty Office
 - [ ] 
>This office is comfortably furnished with a wide oak desk, a high-backed leather armchair, a towering bookcase, and homey wall hangings.

- Characters who search any of these offices find scattered research papers, course notes, and other paperwork and academic bric-a-brac.
- **Treasure**. Each office also has a 25 percent chance of having loose change worth 5 gp in a desk drawer.

###### C13. Captain Dapplewing’s Study
 - [ ] 
>This large office serves as both parlor and study. Antique furnishings line the walls, along with the sculpted heads of several magic creatures. A heavy table and a desk are covered in scattered documents.

- Once Captain Dapplewing’s study, this large office is often used for sensitive discussions among faculty members. The decor has stayed the same since Captain Dapplewing’s time.
- On the northern wall, a plaque holds the heads of a black and a red dragon, each clearly constructed from metallic crafting supplies. This device is a strange magic curiosity that was once a favorite of the captain’s and that faculty members using the office know to avoid. The plaque animates both heads to attack any character who moves within 5 feet of it.
- While animated, each dragon head has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. On initiative count 20, the black dragon head exhales a glob of acid while the red dragon exhales a fiery missile, each targeting one creature the head can see (+6 to hit). A creature hit by either attack takes `dice:1d8 + 2` damage of the appropriate type (acid or fire).
- Each head has a speed of 0, AC 16, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Their ability scores are as follows: Strength 6, Dexterity 14, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1.

###### C14. Central Passageway
 - [ ] 
- This wide hallway offers access to the rooms on the second level of the manor. A large pillar that juts into the passageway appears to be a structural column, but actually hides a staircase leading to area C20. Because the students and faculty here don’t bother to fully close it, the secret door can be found with any search of the area.

###### C15. Faculty Storage
 - [ ] 
- Boxes and filing cabinets have been crammed into this area, filled with old written records and outdated research. If the characters spend a few minutes searching here, they can easily find a box labeled “Manor Archive.” This details all the historical information found at the start of the “Captain Dapplewing’s Manor” section.
- **Treasure**. The paneling in the northeast corner conceals a secret door that isn’t fully shut, and so it can be found by any character who searches the area. Beyond the door is a secondary storage area holding boxes with personal items that faculty members have stashed away from prying eyes. Any character who searches the secondary storage area spots a [[ring of mind shielding]] seemingly lost by someone while working in the room. The inscription “V. Lang” inside the band hints that the ring belongs to Verelda Lang, the characters’ Magical Physiologies professor. If they bring the lost ring to her, she is effusive in her thanks — and then offers it to the characters as a gift, trying to conceal her pride at their accomplishments.

###### C16. Reflection Room
 - [ ] 
>Daybeds piled high with pillows stand in the corners of this spacious, comfortable-looking room.

- This is the manor’s quiet room, where faculty go to read or write without being disturbed.
- **Treasure**. If the characters search this area, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals several small hidden drawers in the frame of one of the day beds. Inside one of the drawers is a [[gem of brightness]] with 10 charges remaining.

###### C17. Grand Lounge
 - [ ] 
>This spacious lounge is decorated to an arcano-bio­logist’s tastes. Paintings of strange magic creatures line the walls, as do mounted collections of insects and reptiles. Three pteranodons form the room’s centerpiece — all of them magically immobile in midair, positioned as if engaging in a strange dance.

- Located just in front of the large sofa along the north wall, the three creatures are subjects of study by the manor’s faculty. Each uses the pteranodon stat block but has the magic ability to freeze in place, even in midair. With no faculty around to control them, the dormant creatures awake and attack the characters as soon as they enter the room.

`encounter: 3: Pteranodon`

###### C18. Tea Room
 - [ ] 
>Several delicate tea sets are arranged on the floor in this room, alongside beautifully woven kneeling rugs and cabinets against the walls.

- **Treasure**. One cabinet along the east wall is filled with tea-making supplies, plus a bottle with a sweet-smelling liquid inside. The bottle holds a [[potion of mind reading]].

###### C19. Student Storage
 - [ ] 
- This storeroom is filled with loose parchment, books, and misfiled paperwork. In the center of the room, two crates containing ink jars have been knocked over, a mishap that faculty members intend to program the Earl in area C3 to clean up the next day. The ink has drawn power from a number of old magic-infused writings in the area, and now it’s become two hostile creatures. These now behave as two gray oozes. The magic ink stealthily follows any characters who enter this area, and attacks aggressively at first opportunity.

`encounter: 2: Gray Ooze`

- **Treasure**. The paneling in the northwest corner conceals a secret door, which can be found with a search of the area and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. Beyond the door is a secondary storage area that is much better organized, though a thick layer of dust on the boxes and crates here indicates that no one has accessed it in a while. Characters who search this area find two [[potion of mind reading|potions of mind reading]] tucked into a pouch in one of the boxes.

###### C20. Attic
 - [ ] 
>This cramped attic holds oddities considered too strange to display on the manor’s main floor. An adult-sized riding toy resembling a roc on a spring, a fine dress with wings made of bones, and a display shelf holding dozens of dolls are among the curiosities here.

- Dangerous in a way the faculty members don’t understand yet, the dress is actually a hostile Construct. It uses the quadrone stat block and can shoot the bones from its wings using the quadrone’s gears launcher attack. When the characters enter this area, it attacks.

`encounter: 1: Modron Quadrone`

- **Sassy Sally Jane**. Among the dolls on the display shelf is the target of the characters’ quest — the pink-haired doll known as Sassy Sally Jane. The doll is programmed to utter rumors and secrets about other students, much like a "Burn Book", but in doll form. It can also record new phrases by whoever possessed the doll, which can be used to record new secrets, or used in a more unique way such as to cheat on tests.
- **Treasure**. Sitting underneath Sassy Sally Jane is a doll wearing a suit and adorned with a large white mustache. A purse held in the doll’s hands contains 25 gp.

###### Post Quest
 - [ ] 
- If the characters retrieve Sassy Sally Jane, the students waiting outside Captain Dapplewing’s Manor cheer quietly. All the students can easily steal back to their dormitories without getting caught. The characters’ peers are true to their word and pay for the characters’ lunches for a month. Further, the characters can keep Sassy Sally Jane. (However, obvious use of the doll around faculty members results in Sassy Sally Jane being confiscated again!)
- If all the characters are reduced to 0 hit points inside the manor, they spend the night unconscious and are found by members of the faculty in the morning. The characters are taken to the infirmary in their respective dorms, then formally chastised and made to attend special behavioral courses that prevent them from participating in any Extracurriculars or Jobs for the rest of this academic year. All the characters immediately lose any benefits from these activities.
- **A Sibling’s Gift**. If a student asked the characters for Sassy Sally Jane for their younger brother and the characters give them the doll, the student gives them the promised [[driftglobe]]. If no student approached the characters with this request, a student with whom a character has at least 1 positive Relationship Point asks the characters for the doll to give it as a gift to her younger brother shortly after this quest ends.

#### Week 19: Magical Physiologies Exam: Slaadi

* The characters’ third and final Exam in Magical Physiologies takes place a few weeks after their foray into Captain Dapplewing’s Manor, and tests the characters’ knowledge of slaadi.

##### Studying Phase
 - [ ] 
- In the days before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.
- Once you’ve asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 12 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters’ rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

> [!info] All About Slaadi
> To give this Exam more flavor, describe some of the facts the characters are trying to memorize, such as the following:
> - Slaadi are Aberrations known for their regenerative abilities and magic resistance.
> - All slaadi are dangerous and unpredictable, but red slaadi and blue slaadi are the least powerful and don’t cast spells.
> - Red slaadi can use a gland under one of their claws to implant an egg into a Humanoid. The egg eventually becomes a tadpole that bursts from the host’s body and transforms into a full-grown blue slaad, or a green slaad if the host could cast spells of 3rd level or higher.
> - Green, gray, and death slaadi can shape-shift into Small or Medium Humanoids.
> - A green slaad usually wields a staff and can hurl both fireballs and magical flames at its foes.
> - Death slaadi are rumored to have a stench so bad it can be deadly. In reality, they can cast the cloudkill spell.
> - Inexperienced scholars and adventurers sometimes assume that “slaad” is a misspelling or mispronunciation. Calling these creatures “salads” is frowned upon.

##### Testing Phase
 - [ ] 
- On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:
	- **Slaad Facts**. Choosing the correct multiple choice answers to questions about red, blue, green, gray, and death slaadi requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
	- **Defusing Slaad Confrontations**. Writing short essays about commonly accepted ways to keep slaadi calm during unexpected encounters requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- Have each player note their character’s Exam results — how many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the test — on their copies of the tracking sheet.

#### Week 22: The Rose Stage

###### All the World’s a Stage
 - [ ] 
- A few weeks after their third Exam, the characters become aware of the buzz on campus regarding the Rose Stage Festival. Held every year, the Rose Stage Festival blends performing arts and improvisation to produce a new play. The entire student body is invited to participate or spectate as they wish.
- Another student is part of this scene — ideally a student the characters have interacted with, or maybe a random one. When you’re ready to begin this event, read or paraphrase the following:
>Yodeling, mocking chants, dramatic intonations, baritone singing, and other enthusiastic sounds reach your ears as a rowdy, laughing group of students comes into view.

- A student sees the characters and shouts a greeting. Beckoning the characters closer, the student says:
>“We’re on our way to the Rose Stage over on Silverquill’s campus. The Rose Stage Festival is finally here! Everyone’s already practicing their performances!”
>“The festival is all about improv. The drama guild gives out prompts, and anyone who wants can take the stage and deliver their lines however they please. It’s hilarious — you’ve got to come check it out!”

###### The Rose Stage
 - [ ] 
- A popular outdoor performing space, the Rose Stage holds benches for spectators, an orchestra pit, and a large main stage decorated with a huge rose. An enclosed annex building behind the main stage serves as a preparation area for performers, as well as a storage area for stage equipment and props.
- The Rose Stage is available to any group or course on campus. The Playactors Drama Guild often uses the stage to rehearse and perform, and other amateur groups and courses with a performance component regularly do so as well. The Playactors Drama Guild is organizing the festival.
- Students of all years and colleges can be found in and around the Rose Stage, as can professors from all parts of Strixhaven.

###### R1. General Seating
 - [ ] 
- This area contains rows of benches, magically treated to resist the elements, and with low-sloping ramps set between them. During the festival, some fifty students can be found in this area, sitting, chatting, and watching the performances.

###### R2. Orchestra Pit
 - [ ] 
- This sunken area is reserved for the student or professional musicians who accompany musical productions or provide ambient music for other stage shows. During the festival, members of the Strixhaven Show Band Association hand out kazoos from this spot to any spectators who wish to accompany the improvised performances.

###### R3. Main Stage
 - [ ] 
- This impressively large oval stage has ample room for performers, props, and other set pieces. A wide set of magic steps rises 5 feet to the stage; sections of it are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility. Pillars to the east and west of the stage are used by production groups to rig backdrops and other set pieces.
- All improvisational acting during the festival must take place on the stage. Members of the Playactors Drama Guild are set up to the south of the stage, handing out random character prompts.

###### R4. Backstage Doors
 - [ ] 
- When regular plays are being performed at the Rose Stage, these doors open up to an area where student performers wait for their cues before discreetly ascending to the main stage. During the festival, this area is empty.
- Although the doors are locked at night, any character who is a member of the Playactors Drama Guild has a key that opens the doors, or a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

###### R5. Rose Room
 - [ ] 
- Normally used for performers to dress, apply makeup, and make other preparations before a show, this area is empty during the festival.

###### R6. Storage Hall
 - [ ] 
- These short hallways connect the main areas of the annex building to its two storage rooms.

###### R7. Stage Storage Area
 - [ ] 
- These areas hold props, equipment, and supplies used for the Rose Stage’s productions. Most of what’s here is marked “Property of the Playactors Drama Guild,” though a few items and boxes are unmarked.
- **Treasure**. A thorough search and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals several valuable items in each storage area. An unmarked box in the west storage area holds three [[Potion of Healing]], held in reserve in case performers are accidentally injured while on stage. In the east storage area, lying forgotten under an unmarked crate, is a [[Bag of Holding]] and a [[Silverquill Primer]].

###### Rose Stage Festival
 - [ ] 
- Characters following the student who got their attention can make their way to the Rose Stage for the festival, where another student catches their attention. This person should also be a student the characters have interacted with previously. Read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the student’s name or other details:
>Cheers, jeers, and the buzzing of kazoos ring out as you draw near the Rose Stage on Silverquill College’s campus. On the main stage, several students playact histrionically. One wears a flamboyant noble’s costume, another wears a felt dragon’s head, and a third wears a court jester’s pantaloons. The audience roars with laughter as the scene plays out.

- A familiar smiling figure approaches the characters. Brandishing a kazoo and laughing, the student says:
>“You here to act? Or maybe just to watch? Or maybe you’re the musical talent? Either way, this is going to be great! I can’t wait to see what you try!”

- The Rose Stage Festival is an improvisational performance that the Playactors Drama Guild puts together every year, and everyone on campus is invited to participate. The goal is to create as much hilarity and fun as possible, and the antics of some festivals are talked about on campus for years.

###### The Show
 - [ ] 
- Members of the Playactors Drama Guild hand out lists of random character prompts to anyone who wants to try acting. Anyone who wishes to play a character on stage chooses a prompt, dons a few costume elements from the trunks of costumes provided by the Playactors Drama Guild, and lines up on the east end of the main stage (area R3). There, **Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III** instructs a waiting participant to “tag in” to the ongoing performance and “tag out” someone currently on stage. Quentillius keeps the transitions narratively clean, while members of the crowd cheer, jeer, and shout ideas to the improvising actors. Other participants work the random props, set pieces, and sound effects the Playactors Drama Guild has strewn about the stage area to augment the improvised events.
- Members of the crowd might play kazoos to musically accompany the drama on stage. A number of members of the Strixhaven Show Band Association are handing out kazoos from the orchestra pit (area R2), including student conductor **Rubina Larkingdale**.
- The festival’s improvised play continues until all volunteer performers have exhausted their prompts. More frequently, however, a faculty member needs to shut down the festival, which becomes increasingly rowdy later into the night. The following subsections detail the ways in which the characters can join the fun.

###### Perform on Stage
 - [ ] 
- A character who wants to perform chooses a character prompt and whatever costume pieces catch their eye and then heads to the east side of the stage (area R3). After waiting a short while, Quentillius signals a break in the action so that the new performer can take the stage. The player character can act out their improv character in the performance any way they like. Raising the creativity beyond just acting to incorporate singing, rapping, or dancing is encouraged! No matter what approach the player takes to their character’s performance, impressing the crowd also requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check. (If another ability check or skill feels applicable to an unconventional performance, feel free to let the character make that check instead.) A successful ability check results in the crowd’s cheering and whistling, while a failed check results in boos and jeers. Further, the character whose Charisma (Performance) check is highest earns a valuable reward from an appreciative professor after this event ends; see “A Professor’s Appreciation.”
- To increase the level of the challenge — and the fun — you might have interested players roll their characters’ prompts randomly on the Festival Character Prompts table.

| d12 | Prompt                                |
|-----|---------------------------------------|
| 1   | Cowardly monarch                      |
| 2   | Brilliant but exasperated knight      |
| 3   | Rampaging but erudite sea serpent     |
| 4   | Furious ship’s captain                |
| 5   | Paranoid wizard                       |
| 6   | Businessperson transformed into a cat |
| 7   | Swashbuckling servant                 |
| 8   | Bawdy noble                           |
| 9   | Mage who can’t control their magic    |
| 10  | Toddler in an adult’s body            |
| 11  | Adult in a toddler’s body             |
| 12  | Very hungry monster                   |

###### Handle Props
 - [ ] 
- A character who doesn’t want to perform can handle props from the ends of the stage. When Quentillius cues them, the character can bring one of the many prepared stage props to the performers, move a set piece around the stage, or improvise sound effects to augment the improvised play. This might include carrying wooden cutouts of painted waves during a nautical scene, rolling fake monsters near the actors when danger threatens and impersonating the monsters’ snarls, handing dueling actors improbable “weapons,” or the like. Responding to the cues in a way that complements the action on stage requires a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- When a character handles props, allow them to choose the props they like most from the Festival Props table or have them roll on that table. These props are scattered around the outer stage.
- Though prop-handling characters have no way to know it, one of the wooden cutout monsters turns into a real owlbear in the next section!

| d8 | Prop                                                                                |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Wooden cutouts on wheels of an owlbear, a basilisk, and a chimera                   |
| 2  | Wooden cutouts of painted waves                                                     |
| 3  | A large wooden cutout of a ship                                                     |
| 4  | Rainclouds with glittery raindrops                                                  |
| 5  | Wooden cutouts of random elemental spells                                           |
| 6  | Three enormous, baggy bodysuits made out of felt with hoods that look like teeth    |
| 7  | Several out-of-tune instruments, including a hurdy-gurdy, a zither, and a mandolin  |
| 8  | Six four-foot-tall scepters made of aluminum inlaid with “gems” made of shiny glass |

###### Accompany with Kazoo
 - [ ] 
- A character might highlight a performance by their friends — or razz an adversary — using one of the kazoos that Rubina and other members of the Strixhaven Show Band Association are handing out at area R2. Highlighting the antics on stage effectively requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check (though another skill might be more applicable, depending on the character’s goal). A successful check grants one character performing on stage advantage or disadvantage on their Charisma (Performance) check to perform.
- **Encourage a Performer**. If a character shouts encouragement to another player character performing on stage, the on-stage character has advantage on their ability check to perform.
- **Heckle a Performer**. A character might jeer at a performer on the stage. If they taunt a player character or the NPC partner of a player character, that character has disadvantage on their ability check to perform.

###### Exit, Pursued by an Owlbear
 - [ ] 
- After the characters have all had a chance to take part in the performance, read or paraphrase the following:
>The crowd roars with laughter and the festival appears to be reaching its height—when suddenly, confused guffaws followed by screams of terror ring out.
>One of the stage props barrels away from its handler, monstrous shrieks coming from its frothing beak. What used to be a comically posed owlbear painted on wood is transforming into a real and enraged owlbear, and it’s rampaging right toward you!

- The owlbear prop turns into an actual attacking owlbear. Assume the owlbear is on whichever side of the stage is closest to the most characters. The player characters must jump into action quickly to defend the other students. When they do, if a character made a successful ability check during the Rose Stage Festival, they have advantage on their first attack against the owlbear.
- Further, because the characters learned about owlbears in their second Exam event of the term, any character who aced that Exam has advantage on all attack rolls during this encounter.
- At the same time the characters are dealing with the owlbear, the other performers and stage crew step up in the background to deal with lesser threats as other props animate and begin to fly around the stage.
- Once the characters defeat the owlbear, it turns back into a wooden prop and the magic infecting other objects in the area ends.

`encounter: 1: Owlbear`

- If all the characters fall unconscious during this fight, Professor Johenne Totsky appears at the start of the next round and dispatches the threat. The professor, who was lingering in the area watching the performance, is as baffled as the characters as to why a stage prop would turn into a real monster.

###### A Professor’s Appreciation
 - [ ] 
- Once the characters have participated in the Rose Stage Festival and dispatched the owlbear threat, if she’s not already on the scene, Professor Totsky approaches the characters and applauds them. She thanks them for dispatching the threat, and she compliments any character who made a successful ability check during the performance. A lover of theater who is immaculately dressed, the professor tells the characters that she recently commissioned a new cloak; she offers the cloak she’s wearing in appreciation of the character whose Charisma (Performance) check to perform on stage was highest. The cloak is a [[cloak of protection]].
- Once the threat is ended, the characters can examine the owlbear to learn more about this incident. If they do, they find the same oily substance they might have found on the trunk during orientation, seen belched out by the frogs before the Firejolt Café race, or spotted on the cauldrons in Bow’s End Tavern.
- If she hasn’t already entered the scene, Professor Totsky arrives while the characters examine the substance. She initially shrugs it off as irrelevant, given that its magic has already faded. But if the characters explain everything they’ve seen at the past year’s strange events to reveal the unseen connections between those events, Professor Totsky realizes what’s going on.
- She explains eldritch balm to the characters and says she believes it’s likely that the Sedgemoor waters used to brew the latest batch of eldritch balm were corrupted in some way. She doesn’t necessarily suspect foul play but mentions that, in the past, students have been caught practicing forbidden magic in the more remote parts of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses Witherbloom College’s campus. Such sinister magic might be responsible for the balm’s corruption, but a random surge of wild magic is an equally likely explanation in her mind. In any case, this corruption must have caused objects treated with the eldritch balm and creatures that came into contact with it to take on temporary — and dangerous — magical properties.
- Professor Totsky gives the characters a flask of holy water and explains that pouring it into the underwater spring whose waters are used to create eldritch balm will settle the waters and prevent further corruption. She describes the location of the spring (area S7) to help the characters find it. She urges the characters to take on this task so she can immediately track down the rest of the contaminated balm and remove it from objects on campus.

> [!info] Eldritch Balm
> Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom’s faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm’s effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.

#### Week 24: Magical Physiologies Practicum

###### Introduction
 - [ ] 
- A few weeks after the incident at the Rose Stage Festival, the characters are scheduled to collect spell components from Sedgemoor and bring those samples back to Professor Lang, as their Magical Physiologies Practicum. This gives them a convenient opportunity to investigate that area on behalf of Professor Totsky.
- The characters know that they must pour the flask of holy water given to them by Professor Totsky into an underwater spring somewhere in area S7. Doing so should prevent future flare-ups of the wild magic that tainted the eldritch balm behind all the strange campus mishaps. In addition, they can find Murgaxor’s journal, which points to a spellcaster’s troublesome meddling, at Wiltroot Hall.
- When the characters venture into Sedgemoor, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:
>Your expedition has brought you to one of the more dismal parts of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom campus. Muddy swamp water flows between raised islets covered with fungi and foliage. Large tree stumps jut out of the water in random places. A pair of rickety wooden docks and two wooden huts are the only indication that people ever come here.

- The characters start out at the southeast corner (area S1) of the Sedgemoor map. They can collect the spell components from areas S2, S3, and S7. At the start, allow only one successful check per islet, to encourage the characters to explore. Once all three islets are explored, the characters can make any number of attempts to gather components on any islet.

###### Sedgemoor
 - [ ] 
- Encompassing Witherbloom College’s campus, Sedgemoor is a wild bayou known for the range of strange creatures that call it home. It is also a rich source of fungi, herbs, spider silk, and other prime components for spells and potions. Sedgemoor isn’t usually dangerous, and it’s routine for students to be sent here as part of their coursework.
- **Sedgemoor Features**. Sedgemoor has the following features:
	- **Building Doors**. The doors to the research sheds (areas S4 and S5) are unlocked.
	- **Swamp Water.** The watery areas on the map are shallow along the shore, growing deeper off the map. Characters walking between islets and tree stumps sink several inches in mud and water, making all these areas difficult terrain.
	- **Tree Stumps**. Stumps protrude 5 feet above the surface of the water. Their slippery and unstable surfaces mean that climbing onto a stump without falling requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check as part of the move.
- Area S7 holds the contaminated spring that is the root cause of the strange manifestations of magic on campus over the previous months. If you’re running this as a campaign, Murgaxor’s journal is also in area S7. As the characters explore, you can have them spot the bubbling of the underwater spring in that area to draw them in.

###### S1. Marsh Banks
 - [ ] 
>Beyond some scrubby bushes, the solid ground here gives way to the muddy swamp. Rickety wooden docks jut into the water, but there are no rafts or boats nearby.

- Rafts and shallow-bottomed punts are normally kept here, but they are all currently in use by Witherbloom students on assignments farther out on the water. The characters need to make their way into Sedgemoor on foot or by other means.

###### S2. South Islet
 - [ ] 
- This is one of the three islets (along with areas S3 and S7) where the characters can collect spell components for Professor Lang.
- Any character who ventures into the swamp on the west side of this islet stumbles into an area of quicksand.

###### S3. Central Islet
 - [ ] 
>The largest islet in this part of the swamp, this landmass features two wooden research sheds with an ancient tree stump between them.

- This is one of the three islets (along with areas S2 and S7) where the characters can collect spell components for Professor Lang.
- Hiding behind the tree stump in the center of this islet are two snarling worgs, which were drawn here by the strange magic in the area. The worgs are hostile and attack as soon as any character sets foot on the island, snarling, “The dark magic! Give it to us!” They run off if the characters reduce one or both of them to 13 or fewer hit points.

`encounter: 2: Worg`

###### S4. South Research Shed
 - [ ] 
- One of two small research sheds on the central islet, this building holds supplies and equipment for Witherbloom students and faculty doing research in Sedgemoor. Moss and fungi harvesting kits can be found here. Each kit weighs 1 pound, consists of various cutting and collecting tools, and grants advantage on a character’s Intelligence (Nature) checks to harvest spell components.

###### S5. North Research Shed
 - [ ] 
- The second of two small research sheds serves as a gathering area for Witherbloom students and faculty when classes take place in the bayou.
- **Treasure**. Any search of this area turns up two [[potion of healing|potions of healing]].

###### S6. East Islet
 - [ ] 
- This is one of the three islets (along with areas S2 and S3) where the characters can collect spell components for Professor Lang.
- A swarm of poisonous snakes nests on this island. It attacks when a character sets foot on this islet, though the snakes disperse and flee if the swarm is reduced to 5 hit points or fewer.

`encounter: 1: Swarm of Poisonous Snakes`

###### S7. Underwater Spring
 - [ ] 
>A steady, burbling flow of water disturbs the surface of the swamp just to the north of this small islet.

- An underground spring flows here. If the characters are quiet for a moment when they are within 20 feet of this area, they can hear the spring burbling (and tell which direction the sound is coming from).
- After the characters arrive in this area, have each of them make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Those who succeed notice the waters in this area rippling unnaturally. The muddy Sedgemoor waters suddenly spray into the sky like a geyser and a mighty chittering echoes throughout the swamp. A giant scorpion, corrupted by the same menace the characters are hoping to stop, was lurking here to ambush prey. If all the characters failed the Wisdom (Perception) checks, the scorpion has advantage on its first attack roll against each of those characters. The scorpion is berserk and fights to the death.

`encounter: 1: Giant Scorpion`

- **Clearing the Waters**. With the scorpion defeated, the characters must pour their holy water from Professor Totsky into the spring. When they do, the liquid from Totsky’s flask purifies the spring, ending the threat of corruption.
- **Murgaxor’s Journal**. A character spots a small, oilskin-wrapped journal sitting atop a small stump. The same black eldritch balm seen throughout the year can be found scattered here as well. Water damage has rendered much of the journal unreadable, but what remains reveals sinister thoughts. It’s clear that some nefarious personality has been experimenting with life-draining magic in the marsh and has been doing so for some time.
- The journal belonged to the evil Murgaxor; it slipped out of his pocket while he practiced the corrupting magic that caused this academic year’s mishaps. The journal notes that Murgaxor’s last step in this scheme involved the Rose Stage Festival (and the Owlbear attack). It also contains a crudely drawn sketch of Wiltroot Hall (which a PC would recognize with a DC 12 Intelligence check, or another student/professor would be able to tell them).

#### Week 26: Secrets in Sedgemoor

###### Wiltroot Hall
 - [ ] 
- Despite its location on the outer grounds of Witherbloom College’s campus, Wiltroot Hall is normally a safe locale. But the activities of Murgaxor have drawn lurking dangers from more remote parts of the bayou.
- As he grows more proficient in his ability to siphon creatures’ energy to power his magic, Murgaxor is practicing lesser forms of more and more powerful magic, evidence of which persists in area W5. The strange energy of his magic has drawn creatures to the area around Wiltroot Hall and made them unusually aggressive.
- **Wiltroot Hall Features**. The hall and surrounding grounds have the following features (areas not numbered are easily traversable but devoid of significant features or creatures):
	- **Building Ceilings**. The ceiling of Wiltroot Hall (area W1) is 40 feet high. The ceilings of the observation huts (areas W2, W7, W9, W10, and W14) are 10 feet high.
	- **Building Doors**. The doors to Wiltroot Hall (area W1) and the observation huts (areas W2, W7, W9, W10, and W14) are unlocked.
	- **Swampy Stinkbrush**. The areas surrounding the clearings and walkways contain a mixture of nearly impassable, awful-smelling deep bog and thick undergrowth. These areas are difficult terrain if the characters want to explore them, but it’s clear that few creatures would intentionally pass through these areas.
	- **Walkways**. The walkways and the platform underneath the hall are made of magically reinforced wood and enclosed by short guard rails. The walkways are two feet above the swamp. Hopping over the guard rail into the bog or clearings below, or pulling oneself up onto a walkway from the ground below, requires an action but no ability check.

###### W1. Hall and Learning Platform
 - [ ] 
>The trunk of an enormous dead tree rises nearly one hundred feet in the air. Near the ground, the wide trunk has been hollowed out and carved to form doors, windows, and a spacious learning center. Surrounding the tree is a wooden platform that overlooks the bog and walkways beyond.

- This area is devoid of faculty, staff, or students, leaving the building full of class supplies. Up to three herbalism kits or poisoner’s kits could be crafted from these materials, as well as up to three vials of antitoxin and two potions of healing.
- A large amount of the eldritch balm that the players have seen all around campus this year can be found here also, as well as another notebook similar to the one they found in Sedgemoor. The last page of the notebook indicates that Murgaxor was writing in it up until a few hours ago when he left to gather materials from the surrounding swamp, suggesting he may be back soon.
- If the players visit here initially, or are otherwise unprepared, then the room is empty. If the players visit here after exploring the other areas of the map, or return here after an initial visit, then jump to the Murgaxor Manifests section.

###### W2. Observation Hut A
 - [ ] 
>The small hut in this clearing has a heavily thatched roof and a rickety door that swings open to reveal a sparse interior. A few wooden chairs and a heavy table with an attached cabinet make up the hut’s furnishings.

- The clearing outside the hut is uninhabited.
- **Treasure**. A cracked stone some pests are gnawing on is an [[Ioun stone]] (awareness). The stone is malfunctioning and was discarded here. A character who tinkers with the Ioun stone for 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check mends the item so it functions as intended.

###### W3. Southwest Clearing
 - [ ] 
>Although the spongy ground here is covered in moss, it’s easily traversable in comparison to the surrounding brush. A raised wooden walkway nearby overlooks this open area.

- This clearing appears to be empty. However, a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals movement in the western part of the surrounding brush. If the characters linger here for a round, they catch the attention an ankheg. The aggressive creature attacks, retreating back into the brush only if the characters reduce one or both of them to 10 hit points or fewer.

`encounter: 1: Ankheg`

###### W4. Southern Outskirts
 - [ ] 
>This open clearing features a notable pool of black, sludgy refuse in the southern corner.

- If the characters approach the refuse, it reveals itself to be an aggressive black pudding. The black pudding has eaten the remnants of creatures slain in this region recently, so it’s Huge. Its game statistics are otherwise the same. The black pudding tries to flee when reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, as do any puddings resulting from it splitting.

`encounter: 1: Black Pudding`

###### W5. Southern Clearing
 - [ ] 
>A ring of peat, decayed leaves, and beetle-infested animal skulls sit in the middle of this open clearing. The stench of rot is strong.

- This clearing holds two clues to the evil activity taking place in this part of the bayou.
- **Mage Hunter Chitin**. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a piece of chipped chitin plating. This plating sloughed off mage hunters when they visited here, but the characters can't identify it. If a character shows the plating to a faculty member, the faculty member says it could have come from a dangerous creature but is unsure of its origin.
- **Murgaxor’s Scrawls**. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals illegible scrawls in the dirt that match the writing in the journal the characters found in Sedgemoor last academic year.

###### W6. Southeastern Clearing
 - [ ] 
>A noticeable chill falls over this clearing as you step into it. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a shadowy figure move across the leaves.

- The shadow, a swampgas shade, takes the form of a beast that Murgaxor killed in order to fuel his experiments. It is aggressive and attacks the players immediately.

`encounter: 1: Swampgas Shade`

###### W7. Observation Hut B
 - [ ] 
>A small hut, its thatched roof drooping heavily, languishes in the southern edge of this clearing. A canopy of ancient growth looms over it.

- If the characters approach the hut, it becomes clear that the leafy canopy is obscuring a giant scorpion. The aggressive creature attacks, as does the ankheg that steps out from the brush behind it. The creatures fight each other — another unusual event in this area. If the characters don't interfere then they will eventually kill each other.
- **Treasure**. Herbalism supplies cover a heavy table inside this hut — enough to assemble one herbalism kit.

`encounter: 1: Giant Scorpion, 1: Ankheg`

###### W8. Western Clearing
 - [ ] 
>You arrive at the clearing to find two of your classmates cautiously eying two large, yellow, viscous puddles oozing out from the underbrush near the west side of this clearing.

- The characters’ classmates **Urzmaktok Grojsh** and **Melwythorne** (two Witherbloom apprentices) came here to explore the area. Ever the overachiever, Urzmaktok is taking advantage of the empty grounds to gather plant cuttings. He hopes to study them through the Fantastical Horticulture Club and petition his Witherbloom professors for extra credit if he successfully nurtures them. Timid for a third-year student, Urzmaktok convinced the lonely Melwythorne to accompany him to the grounds, both so Melwythorne might tell stories about his grove and so Melwythorne could protect him from any dangers.
- The two Witherbloom students had decided to approach the puddles when the characters discover them. When anyone steps toward the puddles, they jiggle and solidify into two ochre jellies. If they see the characters, the jellies climb up onto the walkway in pursuit of prey. An ochre jelly reduced to 5 hit points or fewer tries to flee.

`encounter: 2: Ochre Jelly`

- **Witherbloom Peers**. Once an altercation begins with the ochre jellies, Urzmaktok and Melwythorne flee to safety. After combat ends, any friendly word convinces them to help the characters.

###### W9. Observation Hut C
 - [ ] 
>This large and well-maintained observation hut has one level above the walkway and another below it.

- When the characters enter this building, they smell the pungent algae within a large fountain bubbling up from the center of the floor of the lower level. This is a naturally occurring spring. A pockmarked stone carving in the shape of a stylized, anthropomorphic wave surrounds and collects the water.
- **Javenesh Stoutclaw** (NG male owlin Lorehold apprentice) stands next to the fountain, tilting his head in confusion and ruffling his feathers while seemingly talking to himself. If the characters approach the fountain, they see that Javenesh is speaking with a water weird submerged inside it. Unlike most water weirds, this creature, named Lothannep, can speak and understand Common.
- Lothannep lives in the fountain when the university isn’t in session. Lothannep was bound generations ago to a pool located in the wilds off Witherbloom’s campus. Lothannep’s mage master released it long ago, and it has been wandering about as it pleases since.
- Lothannep likes this hut but will be ejected once the Witherbloom faculty discovers the weird’s presence. A character can befriend Lothannep by engaging it in friendly conversation and succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check, with advantage if the character is a Witherbloom student. The water weird can be persuaded to relocate to another body of water, but only if a character toward which it is friendly suggests it.
- **Lorehold Peer**. Javenesh traipsed to this area on an errand for Tulk Tusktooth, the manager of Bow’s End Tavern. Tulk asked Javenesh to collect water from this fountain for use in Chef Curtie Axe­chucker’s special dish. Javenesh is trying and failing to explain to Lothannep why he needs the water when the characters arrive.
- A character who strikes up a friendship with the water weird can persuade Lothannep to leave the fountain long enough for Javenesh to fill his tankard. Whether or not the characters help Javenesh with his errand, the owlin is amenable to aiding them with their mission.

###### W10. Observation Hut D
 - [ ] 
>Stained paint brushes and empty watercolor palettes are scattered on a table in this small thatched-roof hut, which has a view of large clearings to the north and south.

- The table in the building holds enough materials to create a set of painter’s supplies and a set of calligrapher’s supplies.

###### W11. Northwestern Clearing
 - [ ] 
>Tangled vines and trees draped with thick, hanging moss flank the northern edges of this large clearing. Movement in the foliage to the north gives the area a sense of being alive.

- When a character ventures toward the north end of this clearing, two giant elk burst out of the foliage. The giant elk are angry and confused, and they attack. If an elk is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it regains its senses and tries to flee.

`encounter: 2: Giant Elk`

###### W12. Northern Clearing
 - [ ] 
>The wide wooden walkway here runs alongside a small clearing in the bog. A thick bed of mushrooms grows along the clearing’s western edge.

- A character who moves toward the clearing’s western side sees a giant boar munching on the mushrooms. Like the elk in area W11, the boar is angry and confused and initially attacks. If it’s reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, it tries to flee into the bog.

`encounter: 1: Giant Boar`

###### W13. Northern Outskirts
 - [ ] 
>The boggy ground here feels firmer than at many of the other clearings, and flowering plants fill the area. It’s a lovely, unexpected landscape within the marsh, as the delicate floral scents mix with those of peat and earth to perfume the air.

- This area is devoid of any creatures.
- **Treasure**. If the characters search this area, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals an emerald-colored glint in the stamen of a large pink flower. This is an [[elemental gem]] (emerald), discarded or perhaps lost. If the characters speak to Witherbloom faculty members about it, the characters learn that no one has reported the lost item, so they’re permitted to keep it.

###### W14. Observation Hut E
 - [ ] 
>A small hut with a thatched roof sits beside the wooden walkway that cuts through this large clearing. Two bulbous masses of fungus and vegetation grow in the southeast corner behind the building.

- If a character approaches the southeast corner behind the observation hut, two brackish trudges animate. Like the elk in area W11 and the boar in area W12, the trudges are initially hostile and attack. However, if a trudge is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it regains its senses and tries to flee.

`encounter: 2: Brackish Trudge`

###### Murgaxor Manifests
 - [ ] 
- If the players return to area W1, or attempt to leave the area entirely, they instead find Murgaxor - who has surrounded himself with six creatures (giant elk, giant scorpion, worg, ankheg, poisonous snake, brackish trudge) from which he's attempting to drain life using ritual stones. 
- **Murgaxor and the Ritual Stones**. Characters can attack Murgaxor and/or the five ritual stones circling him. Each stone is an 8-inch-long cylindrical opal covered with delicate golden runes. It has AC 18, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing Murgaxor to 0 hit points or destroying all five ritual stones ends the life draining magic.
- **Murgaxor’s Lair Actions**. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Murgaxor can take one of the following lair actions.
	- **Summon Mephits**. Murgaxor summons two mud mephits that appear in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The mephits obey Murgaxor’s commands, take their turns on initiative count 15 (losing initiative ties), and fight until destroyed.
	- **Life Drain**. Murgaxor drains life from one of the six creatures in the area, as long as he has at least one ritual stone in play. This action kills the creature, turning it into a swampgas shade that wanders off into the depths of the swamp, and Murgaxor regains `dice: 2d4 + 5` hit points.

`encounter: 1: Murgaxor`
`encounter: 2: Mud Mephit`

- **Clinging to Life**. Murgaxor’s ritual wreaks havoc on the equilibrium of life and death, creating a regional effect in the Wiltroot Hall area, where death saving throws are made with advantage. The effect ends `dice:1d6` days after the ritual ends or is interrupted.

###### End of the Year
 - [ ] 
- After the characters complete their investigation of Sedgemoor and Wiltroot Hall (and hopefully taking on Murgaxor), no more significant events happen before the end of the year. Wrap up any ongoing roleplaying scenes or Relationship interests the characters are pursuing this academic year.
- Thanks to the central role they played in dealing with the outbreaks of kerfuffles, the characters have become well known across the entire campus. Professors thank them for their bravery, and the characters are named Students of the Year in a lavish ceremony on the central campus attended by their Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds, as well as any professors they’ve encountered this academic year. They’re also vaunted in the Strixhaven Star newspaper as heroes. Feel free to use additional roleplaying scenes and other details to reinforce how the characters’ actions have made a name for them!
