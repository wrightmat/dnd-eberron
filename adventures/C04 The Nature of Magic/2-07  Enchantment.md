### Background and Hook(s)

* The players awaken in Aundair, with no memory of their lives as adventurers. They find themselves living mundane but fulfilling lives, each tailored to their desires and personalities. This is the result of a powerful modify memory spell cast by an enigmatic enchanter, intended to neutralize their threat and prevent them from interfering with a larger plan.
* As the adventure unfolds, subtle inconsistencies in their lives begin to appear. The players must piece together the truth, recover their memories, and break free from the enchantment before they lose themselves entirely.

### Scenes and Situations

###### Phase 1: Comfortable Lives
 - [ ] 
- Players begin immersed in their false lives. Create opportunities for them to engage with their crafted roles (e.g., running a shop, teaching students, raising a family).
- Introduce small inconsistencies — a wrong name, a missing detail, or a sense of déjà vu. These are subtle and meant to provoke curiosity. No Wisdom saving throws should be made at this point.
Player Agency: Encourage roleplaying as they adapt to their new lives and react to the inconsistencies. No immediate pressure to uncover the truth, allowing immersion.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Each player begins the adventure living a carefully crafted alternative life, based on their character’s desires or fears. A good way to craft this could be to fulfill whatever the characters' motivation is and present that as their life.
