### Background and Hook(s)

* The Oriq and/or House Tarkanan has gone back in time and killed Mordain the Fleshweaver, wiping out the Tower of Mordain and the focus of transmutation magic in the process. This has created an alternate timeline that the players currently reside on, but a mysterious obelisk can be used to travel back in time and attempt to correct the events of the past.

### Characters and Locations

* **[[Mordain the Fleshweaver]]**

* **[[Mordain’s Hall]]**

### Scenes and Situations

###### Navigating to Mordain's Hall
 - [ ] 
- Players must navigate the Forest of Flesh in order to find the Tower of Mordain within Mordain's Hall. This requires three successful DC 12 (+hours of travel) Survival checks for each hour, with any failures resulting in a random encounter.

- When the players arrive at the Tower of Mordain, there's no tower there! Instead, there's a black obelisk, 15 feet tall, marked with strange runes. The obelisk radiates an aura of arcane energy, in the form of transmutation magic. If touched, the obelisk instantly hurls anyone within 50 feet through time and space.

###### Back in Time
 - [ ] 
- The PCs are sent back in time to 797 YK, when Mordain was excoriated from House Phiarlan. The Twelve, led by Salyon Syrralan d'Sivis, tried him for his crimes and attempted to execute him. However, every method the Twelve used failed: Mordain was bathed in acid, burned at the stake, drowned, and even dismembered, yet after each horrible death Mordain's flesh reformed and he awoke renewed.
- Every method, that is, except for the final attempt by the newest member of the Twelve, who is known for wearing a strange mask (instantly recognizable to the players as an Oriq mask). He uses powerful blood magic to drain every drop of blood from Mordain, totally emaciating and killing him.
- At that point, the players are instantly returned to their time and previous location, where the obelisk is still there in place of Mordain's Tower (and transmutation magic still doesn't work). It should be clear to them at this point (via History checks or some other means) that the Oriq agent was some sort of temporal interloper who was not supposed to be there that day, and who changed the course of history by interfering and killing Mordain.
- If inspected after their return, the runes on the obelisk can also be deciphered (DC 12 Arcana check). Understanding of the runes allows players some control over their time travel, allowing them to dictate at what point and location (within a few days/weeks and miles of the original point) they travel back in time. This allows more flexibility in options to deal with the Oriq, possibly taking on the agent well before the day that Mordain was killed.
- The goal of the players should be to alter the events that took place in some way, stopping the Oriq agent from changing the timeline. This should be an entirely open-ended adventure, with the players being able to choose their method of interference.

###### Timeline Restored
 - [ ] 
- Once the timeline has been restored, the players are returned to their previous location, which now has a huge black dragonflesh tower in place of the previous obelisk.
- At this point we could have some sort of encounter with Mordain, or a unique combat. Maybe something that focuses on their newly restored transmutation magic somehow.
