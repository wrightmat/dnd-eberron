### DM Notes and Random Tables

- A large monster that consumes magic, based on the Arcanaton from Pathfinder (and possibly taking the Antimagic Cone from the Beholder), is rampaging across Morgrave. Maybe named an Arcane Devourer (like an Intellect Devourer), possibly with appearance and other traits based on the Eldrazi from MtG. The players may need to find a way to weaken it before they can take it on? But with little help from anyone else, since all their magic is gone.
- Ideas from ChatGPT:
	- Protective Barriers: Navigating through layers of magical barriers within the sanctum.
	* Guardian Constructs: Battling constructs enhanced with abjuration spells like Shield and Warding Bond.
	* Counterspell Duels: Engaging in duels where counterspells and dispels are crucial to victory.
