### Scenes and Situations

###### Morgrave University and the Aegis Matrix
 - [ ]

	- Examine the site of the sabotage for evidence, such as the agent’s magical signature or notes on their motives.
	- Learn that the Oriq agent has scattered the Matrix’s core components to prevent reassembly.

###### The Keystone of Shielding
 - [ ] 
- The first piece is hidden in the Hall of Arcane Warfare, now overrun by malfunctioning defensive constructs.
- Players must deactivate or bypass the constructs, whose attacks mimic spells like Shield and Counterspell.

###### The Sigil of Warding
 - [ ] 
- The second piece is trapped in the Vault of Forgotten Relics, where magical artifacts have gone haywire due to the failing wards.
- Players face chaotic magical effects and rogue artifacts (e.g., animated spell scrolls or cursed items).

###### The Glyph of Banishment
 - [ ] 
- The final piece is anchored in the Planar Studies Wing, now distorted by a planar rift.
- Players must close the rift while contending with extraplanar creatures, using tools and strategies to simulate abjuration spells like Banishment and Dispel Magic.

###### Reassembling the Aegis Matrix
 - [ ] 
- The components must be reassembled in the Central Ward Nexus, a secure chamber beneath the university. This process involves aligning the components into their proper configuration to restore the artifact’s protective power.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- A large monster that consumes magic, based on the Arcanaton from Pathfinder (and possibly taking the Antimagic Cone from the Beholder), is rampaging across Morgrave. Maybe named an Arcane Devourer (like an Intellect Devourer), possibly with appearance and other traits based on the Eldrazi from MtG. The players may need to find a way to weaken it before they can take it on? But with little help from anyone else, since all their magic is gone.
- Ideas from ChatGPT:
	- Protective Barriers: Navigating through layers of magical barriers within the sanctum.
	* Guardian Constructs: Battling constructs enhanced with abjuration spells like Shield and Warding Bond.
	* Counterspell Duels: Engaging in duels where counterspells and dispels are crucial to victory.
