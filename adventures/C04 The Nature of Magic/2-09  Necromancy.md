### Background and Hook(s)

* Deep in the jungles of Xen’drik, a rare celestial alignment has caused both Mabar, the Endless Night, and Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead, to become coterminous. At the epicenter, a combined manifest zone has formed, drawing immense necromantic energy into the region. The natural balance is disrupted, turning the area into a battleground where life struggles against the pull of unending death.
* The drow of the region view the manifest zone as a desecration of their ancestral lands and are fighting to contain its spread. The shadar-kai, emissaries of Mabar, see it as an opportunity to strengthen their dark realm’s influence over Eberron. Both sides summon necromantic creatures to bolster their forces, further destabilizing the zone and escalating the conflict. The players must decide how to handle the situation and reduce the number of necromantic forces, helping to close the combined manifest zone in the process.

### Characters and Locations

* **Kaelith Voidveil** (male shadar-kai necromancer). The leader of the shadar-kai, Kaelith believes the zone is a sacred opportunity to strengthen Mabar’s influence. He respects strength and cunning but is blind to the Oriq’s manipulation.
* **Aevryn Soulsong** (male drow cleric). A spiritual leader attuned to Dolurrh’s energies. He believes the zone is a test of the drow’s faith and advocate for balance over destruction.
* **Voryn Blackspire** (male shadar-kai knight). Kaelith’s enforcer, Voryn is a stoic warrior who sees the players as obstacles until proven otherwise. He respects honor but will not hesitate to eliminate threats.

* **Xen'drik**

### Scenes and Situations

###### Arrival in Xen’drik
 - [ ] 
- The adventure begins with the players arriving at the edge of the manifest zone, where life has already begun to decay unnaturally. They encounter a drow war party, led by a fervent priestess, accusing the players of allying with the shadar-kai.
- Signs of necromantic corruption abound, such as undead animals stalking the jungle and trees withering into skeletal shapes.
- The drow explain that the shadar-kai have summoned horrific undead to claim the zone, and they demand the players join their fight.

###### The Shadar-kai Stronghold
 - [ ] 
- The players encounter a faction of shadar-kai who argue that the manifest zone is a natural phenomenon and should not be closed. Their leader claims the drow are merely jealous of Mabar’s power and accuses them of summoning their own necromantic horrors to tilt the balance.
- The shadar-kai offer the players a bargain: help them secure the zone, and they will use its power responsibly to keep it contained.

###### Exploring the Manifest Zone(s)
 - [ ] 
- To disrupt the Oriq’s plan, the players must enter the heart of the manifest zone, facing:
	- Necrotic Phenomena: Enhanced undead creatures, environmental hazards like necrotic storms, and magical anomalies caused by the overlapping planes.
	- Drow and Shadar-kai Forces: Both factions patrol the area, forcing the players to choose between stealth, diplomacy, or combat.
	- Oriq Devices: Evidence of sabotage, such as necromantic amplifiers using Mabar Crystals, is scattered throughout the zone.

###### Deciding the Balance
 - [ ] 
- The players discover the truth:
	- The combined energies of Mabar (destruction) and Dolurrh (final rest) are inherently unstable, threatening to annihilate all life in the region if left unchecked.
	- The manifest zone’s influence is strongest at an ancient temple at the epicenter, where rituals from both planes overlap.
- The players must choose how to address the crisis:
	- Aid the Drow: Destroy the zone entirely, severing the connection to both planes but risking collateral damage.
	- Aid the Shadar-kai: Stabilize the zone to preserve Mabar’s power while suppressing Dolurrh, leaving residual necrotic magic.
	- Seek a Third Path: Perform a ritual to balance the energies, restoring natural order while requiring cooperation from both factions.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The alignment of Mabar and Dolurrh is not natural — someone must have forced the two planes into convergence.
 - [ ]  Strange devices, powered by Mabar Crystals, have been found near the edges of the manifest zone. They radiate necrotic energy.
 - [ ]  The planar energy in this region feels artificially amplified, as if something is feeding it beyond its natural state.
 - [ ]  There are whispers of shadowy figures performing rituals before the planar alignment began, but no one knows who they were.
 - [ ]  Ancient texts predict that Mabar and Dolurrh should never align this closely — this kind of overlap is unheard of.
 - [ ]  Echoes of the dead in Dolurrh speak of mortals who ‘darkened the skies’ and manipulated the planes for their own gain.
 - [ ]  The energies of Mabar and Dolurrh seem to feed off the conflict between the drow and shadar-kai, growing stronger as the war escalates.
