### Background and Hook(s)

* The Oriq have corrupted/converted the captain of the King's Wands (part of the King's Citadel), Captain Nebik, convincing him to use the King's Wands forces to steal an artifact known as the Eye of Siberys. This artifact allows Nebik to magnify his divination magic, drawing and draining it from all over Khorvaire. Nebik is also using this magic for evil, leveraging the King's Dark Lanterns to arrest people before they commit crimes (pre-cog, Minority Report style).
* The players are accused of conspiracy against the Citadel, arrested based on a "future crime," and imprisoned in The Citadel’s dungeons in Wroat. To stop Nebik, they must escape, uncover the truth of his corruption, and confront the ethical implications of free will versus predestination.

### Characters and Locations

* **Lord Kor ir'Wynarn** (NG male human commander). He runs the King's Citadel from the Citadel's headquarters in Citadel Tower in Wroat, and commands the captains of the five branches of the King's Citadel. Kor ir'Wynarn is armed with the latest magical items for personal protection, which he secretly receives from the Oriq.
* **Captain Nebik** (NG male gnome wizard). Divination wizard who commands the King's Wands, based at the Citadel in Wroat. They provide magical support for the other agencies that operate within the Citadel.
* **Captain Vron**. Leader of the King's Dark Lanterns.

* **[[Wroat]], Breland**
* **The Citadel**. The King's Citadel is headquartered at the Citadel, a large obsidian tower on the central island of Wroat, Breland's capital. From there, Kor ir'Wynarn and his branch captains oversee Citadel operations.

### Scenes and Situations

###### Arrest by the Dark Lanterns
 - [ ] 
- The adventure begins with the players arrested by a team of King’s Dark Lanterns, acting on Nebik’s vision of their "future crimes."
- The players may attempt to resist arrest through combat or clever roleplaying. However, the Dark Lanterns have Nebik’s predictive foresight, making escape nearly impossible without highly creative or unpredictable actions.
- If the players evade capture, they might uncover an encoded message pointing to Nebik’s use of the Eye, pushing them to investigate further.

###### Escape from the Citadel
 - [ ] 
- The players awaken in the heavily guarded Citadel dungeons in Wroat, stripped of their gear. Escaping requires ingenuity and teamwork.
- The players must avoid patrolling guards, who have access to foresight, requiring much more difficult checks.

###### Wroat: A City Under Watch
 - [ ] 
- The players escape into the streets of Wroat, a city brimming with tension as Nebik’s regime grows increasingly oppressive.
- Nebik uses Scrying and Clairvoyance to track potential threats. Players can detect these surveillance spells with Detect Magic and find ways to counter them (Nondetection, antimagic zones, or physical obstructions).
- Clue Trail: The players discover that encoded notes, magical markings, and other hidden messages are scattered throughout the city, left by Nebik’s dissenters.
- This should be run as a full mystery, complete with multiple locations and clues. Goal is probably to find out how Nebik managed this and where he's currently located.

###### Confronting Nebik
 - [ ] 
- Straight up combat!
