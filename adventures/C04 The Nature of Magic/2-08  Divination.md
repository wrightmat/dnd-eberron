### Background and Hook(s)

* The Oriq have corrupted/converted the captain of the King's Wands (part of the King's Citadel), Captain Nebik, convincing him to use the King's Wands forces to steal an artifact known as the Eye of Siberys. This artifact allows Nebik to magnify his divination magic, drawing and draining it from all over Khorvaire. Nebik is also using this magic for evil, leveraging the King's Dark Lanterns to arrest people before they commit crimes (pre-cog, Minority Report style).
* The players are arrested at some point by the King's Dark Lanterns, landing them in a prison cell in The Citadel
