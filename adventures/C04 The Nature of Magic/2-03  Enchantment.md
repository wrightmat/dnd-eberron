### Background and Hook(s)

* The players awaken in Aundair, with no memory of their lives as adventurers. They find themselves living mundane but fulfilling lives, each tailored to their desires and personalities. This is the result of a powerful modify memory spell cast by an enigmatic enchanter, intended to neutralize their threat and prevent them from interfering with a larger plan.
* As the adventure unfolds, subtle inconsistencies in their lives begin to appear. The players must piece together the truth, recover their memories, and break free from the enchantment before they lose themselves entirely.

### Characters and Locations

* **Caleon Merris** (male human). Caleon is the charismatic mayor of the idyllic Aundairian town where the players live their false lives. Warm and approachable, he’s beloved by the townsfolk for his generosity and genuine care. Caleon frequently visits the players, offering kind words, advice, and assistance with their daily lives. In reality, he's a powerful Oriq enchanter.

* **[[Aundair]]**

### Scenes and Situations

###### Phase 1: Comfortable Lives
 - [ ] 
- Players begin immersed in their false lives. Create opportunities for them to engage with their crafted roles (e.g., running a shop, teaching students, raising a family).
- Introduce small inconsistencies — a wrong name, a missing detail, or a sense of déjà vu. These are subtle and meant to provoke curiosity. No Wisdom saving throws should be made at this point.
- Encourage roleplaying as they adapt to their new lives and react to the inconsistencies. No immediate pressure to uncover the truth, allowing immersion.
- Caleon Merris should be introduced as the mayor of the town early on. Caleon interacts with the players naturally, offering support or guidance as the trusted mayor. He deflects any early suspicions with charm, perhaps dismissing odd occurrences as “stress” or “overthinking.”

###### Phase 2: Cracks in the Illusion
 - [ ] 
- As inconsistencies grow, players experience trigger events that force Wisdom saves. Examples:
	- A farmer remembers a sword technique they shouldn’t know.
	- A schoolteacher encounters a child who calls them “hero.”
	- A vivid dream of battle leaves them disoriented.
- Introduce the first “anchor” clue (e.g., an item, a melody, or an NPC who seems familiar).
- Let players pursue the inconsistencies. They might investigate, confront NPCs, or discuss their feelings with one another, which strengthens the emotional weight. As players continue to explore, allow additional Wisdom saves as is logical.
- Caleon starts appearing more frequently, often when the players discuss inconsistencies or uncover clues. His demeanor remains friendly, but his timing becomes uncanny, creating unease.

###### Phase 3: Fractured Realities
 - [ ] 
- The enchantment begins to weaken, and scenes occasionally “glitch.” Examples:
	- A street morphs into a battlefield momentarily before snapping back.
	- NPCs react as though they know the players’ real identities, then deny it.
	- A memory replays incorrectly, with two versions layered over one another.
- Players start piecing together clues, working toward discovering the enchanter’s lair or triggering a final confrontation.
- Clues encourage active investigation, such as exploring unfamiliar parts of town or questioning key NPCs. This phase blends exploration with heightened tension as the illusion cracks further.
- As the players begin to confront the illusion, Caleon becomes subtly controlling, encouraging them to stay in their “better” lives. He might grow more intense or defensive, warning them against pursuing dangerous truths.

###### Phase 4: Confrontation and Freedom
 - [ ] 
- In the final phase, Caleon drops his friendly façade, becoming a powerful enchanter trying to hold the illusion together. He attempts to reinforce the illusion, using enchantment magic and illusions to disorient the players.
- The players must resist the enchanter’s spells (e.g., mass suggestion, dominate person) while using what they’ve uncovered to shatter the illusion entirely.
- Players combine spell solutions, physical confrontations, and roleplaying to break free. The emotional weight of leaving their crafted lives behind provides a powerful, satisfying resolution.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Each player begins the adventure living a carefully crafted alternative life, based on their character’s desires or fears. A good way to craft this could be to fulfill whatever the characters' motivation is and present that as their life.
- Start off with a certain value that must be reached, almost like hit points for the *modify memory* spell - probably something around 100. Each time a player makes a Wisdom saving throw, it's not against a DC, but the rolled value is subtracted from this value. Once the value hits zero, the spell is shattered. As the value gets lower and lower, more and more inconsistencies should be introduced into the world.
