### Background and Hook(s)

* The plane of Thelanis, now almost entirely ruled by the Prince of Frost, is quickly becoming a frigid place where the snow never melts and the trees are eternally covered in frost (very much like Narnia under the White Witch). This has essentially frozen the magic of the plane, eliminating the illusion magic that once flowed into the material plane of Eberron.

### Characters and Locations

* **Lilydew Pollenwake** (female spring eladrin bard). A mischievous gossip who knows everyone’s secrets but offers them only for a price.
* **Lady Russet** (female autumn eladrin noble).A melancholic fey ruler unsure whether resistance against the Prince is even possible.

### Scenes and Situations

###### Thelanis and The Gate of Joy
 - [ ] 
- Pylas Pyrial is a feyspire, known as the Gate of Joy. Most of the time it rests in the Moonlit Vale of Thelanis, at certain times it is drawn into Eberron. The players find the feyspire in Eberron, but when they approach it, they're quickly drawn into the plane of Thelanis.
- **Player Roles**. Upon entering Thelanis through the Gate of Joy, the players are "rewritten" by the narrative magic of the feyspire. In the eyes of its inhabitants, each player embodies a character integral to the intrigue and drama of the Courts. The players retain their own memories but must navigate a world where they are recognized as someone else — complete with allies, enemies, and obligations they know nothing about.
	- Have each player select a new character role to take on (use cards and have them draw, optionally selecting a new one if they don't like the role). This role will have various connections to the Courts of Thelanis, which the player will need to discover and possibly use to their advantage.
- **Illusion Trinkets**. As the players visit each of the Courts and complete the challenge there, each will be given a trinket that can be spent in order to change a minor detail about the world (limited by DM discretion). These may be used at other Courts in order to discover additional information about the Prince, or might be used in the final battle against the Prince.

###### Summer Court: The Ashen Arena
 - [ ] 
- The Summer Court’s arena, once a site of fiery contests, lies in ruin. Its flames have been extinguished by the Prince’s frost, and the Court is fractured. Ihan de Rhaan, the Court’s ruler, has kept the traditions alive but struggles to rally his people. The players must take part in a grand duel to rekindle the arena’s flames and unify the Court.
- Alternatively, the players may convince Ignis to act (Persuasion or Performance checks) and reignite the Arena, likely killing Frostthorn in the process.
- Victory reignites the arena’s flames, bolstering the Summer Court’s spirit. Ihan de Rhaan commits to opposing the Prince, and the players gain their most fiery ally yet.
- Player Roles in Action:
	- The Cursed Warrior may face Frostthorn in a dramatic clash, their curse fueling both their strengths and weaknesses.
	- The Reluctant Heir might rally Blazewind, invoking shared history to reignite his fighting spirit.
	- The Aspiring Artist could create a moving tribute to the arena’s history, inspiring Ihan and the Court to rise.

###### Spring Court: The Hidden Garden
 - [ ] 
- The Spring Court’s garden party is a subdued affair. Once a vibrant celebration of renewal, the gardens are now marked by petrified plants and a creeping frost. Lord Verdant, the Court’s ruler, is frozen in stone at the center of the party, a constant reminder of the Prince’s power. Guests at the party whisper and conspire, their alliances as delicate as the frost-covered blossoms.
- The players must uncover the artifact’s location while maintaining their personas.
- If the players succeed in restoring Lord Verdant, the Court awakens with renewed life. Their newfound ally provides critical insight into the Prince’s vulnerabilities.
- Player Roles in Action:
	- The Disguised Revolutionary might use their connections to Lord Verdant’s loyalists to expose Lady Rosewillow.
	- The Elusive Spy could uncover Lilydew’s hidden knowledge, navigating her riddles and misdirections.
	- The Court Alchemist may collaborate with Thistle to identify the artifact tied to Lord Verdant’s curse.

###### Autumn Court: A Harvest of Shadows
 - [ ] 
- The Autumn Court is trapped in a perpetual twilight, its vibrant debates and celebrations dulled by the Prince of Frost’s shadow. The Court’s ruler, Lady Russet, remains paralyzed by indecision, torn between despair and action. The players must uncover the truths of their assigned roles while contributing to the Court’s great debate, a once-annual festival now corrupted by doubt and fear.
- The players must sway the debate, revealing truths and motivating the Court to act. This involves uncovering the Prince’s influence and leveraging their roles to shift key NPCs’ positions.
- Player Roles in Action:
	- The Estranged Noble may reconnect with Pax, balancing shared ideals with lingering resentment.
	- The Wandering Bard could use their charisma to draw Marigold out of despair, reigniting her creativity.
	- The Shadowed Scholar might engage Sir Braeburn in intellectual debates, challenging his bravado with cold logic.

###### Winter Court: The Prince of Frost
 - [ ] 
- The players will need to take on the Prince of Frost, likely killing him (or some other means of handling him), in order to return the plane to its former state and return illusion magic to Eberron.
- The Prince should have Lair Actions or something similar that allow him to change the world around him, using the illusion magic he's been collecting. This also allows the players to use the trinkets they've collected to counteract these illusions.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The Prince of Frost struck a bargain with Lady Rosewillow of the Spring Court, offering her power and influence in exchange for her complicity in cursing Lord Verdant. She now regrets the deal but fears breaking it will doom her.
 - [ ]  The creeping frost that binds Thelanis stems from the roots of an ancient tree in the Autumn Court. This tree, once a source of illusion magic, was corrupted when the Prince embedded a shard of his icy power within it. Removing the shard could weaken him.
 - [ ]  Ignis Brighthorn, the trapped fire elemental of the Summer Court, holds part of the Prince’s power. The Prince bound Ignis as both a trophy and a failsafe to suppress rebellion within the Summer Court.
 - [ ]  The artifact that turned Lord Verdant into a statue is a crystalline flower forged by the Prince himself. It draws power from the despair of the Spring Court, making it nearly unbreakable unless the Court’s joy is restored.
 - [ ]  The Prince has created an army of icy constructs that mimic the appearance of fey from the Courts. These illusions sow discord and fear, making it difficult for the Courts to trust one another.
 - [ ]  Pax of the Autumn Court once debated the Prince at the height of their influence. Though they lost, they discovered the Prince’s greatest weakness: his power relies on his ability to maintain illusions of control. Revealing his lies could shatter his influence.
 - [ ]  The Prince wears a crown enchanted with ancient fey magic, allowing him to manipulate the fabric of Thelanis. This artifact was crafted with the help of Lady Russet’s former advisor, Thornrick Ambervine, under duress.
 - [ ]  The Prince brokered an agreement with Sir Braeburn, promising to spare the Autumn Court if they submitted quietly. Sir Braeburn reluctantly agreed, but his guilt has left him vulnerable to persuasion by the players.
 - [ ]  Ihan de Rhaan challenged the Prince to a duel before the Summer Court’s fall. Though he lost, he wounded the Prince, leaving a scar of wild magic that occasionally disrupts the Prince’s illusions.
 - [ ]  The Gate of Joy, Pylas Pyrial, was one of the first places the Prince corrupted. By distorting the illusions that guarded the feyspire, he isolated it from the Material Plane, cutting off one of the strongest sources of illusion magic.
 - [ ]  Marigold Dappledawn was forced to write a song glorifying the Prince’s reign, which spreads his influence to all who hear it. However, Marigold encoded a counter-verse that could weaken his power if performed correctly.
