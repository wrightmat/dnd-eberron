### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Doing something inspired by D20's Mentopolis, or Pixar's Inside Out, could be a lot of fun, but would need to be a tight story that's pared down from those. Maybe they wake up in a strange place with new artifacts/gems/something on their person, which are color coded to indicate their role (emotions, areas of the brain, or whatever) and they only find out later that they're inside someone's mind. The person whose mind they're in is Malakar's lesser officer who is controlling psionic magic by using one of the remaining hanbalani alta (or a dalnan, which is more ancient) to focus his mind. The players need to interrupt this focus (or kill him I guess) from inside of his mind.
- For mechanics of this, use Dungeons & Daddies S3E12 - Trout of the Past for inspiration. Essentially have a token that indicates sole control of the body they're in, and that's passed from player to player as the adventure progresses. Each aspect of the mind has special moves they can perform at any time in order to influence the situation.
- Final battle could be a sort of psionic standoff between the players' mind aspects and the officer's core identity, taking place within the mindscape.
