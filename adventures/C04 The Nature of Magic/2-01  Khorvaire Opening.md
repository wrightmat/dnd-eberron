### Background and Hook(s)

* Have each player roll a d6 and drop them in a different location in Sharn based on the roll and the random table below. Then they either need to find a way to get back to each other, communicate with each other, or gather their own information about what's going on in their location.
* The players’ first goal becomes clear: discover why their magic was drained and seek a way to restore it. Initial exploration uncovers a fragment of a dragonshard imbued with unusual magical energy, pointing toward nexuses of power tied to the schools of magic.

| 1   | **Chance** (Lower Tavick's Landing, Dragoneyes)                | You wake up slumped over a table in a smoky, rowdy tavern. Dice roll across the table as an orc cheers, "Your turn to bet, mate!" You have no idea what you’re gambling on, but coins are missing from your pouch.                                | **Tibbin "Taps" Fallowfist** (Halfling bartender, runs a shady but fair business. “Eh? You showed up outta nowhere, but hey, as long as you pay your tab, who cares?”)       |
| 2   | **A Skycoach, Mid-Air** (Upper Central, Floating above Skyway) | You appear mid-air inside a moving skycoach taxi! The startled driver nearly crashes as you phase into existence. You're in the richest part of the city with no idea where the others are.                                                       | **Jorvax Tain** (Human skycoach pilot, exasperated but fair. "You nearly got us killed! Where did you even come from?")                                                      |
| 3   | **The Fallen Bell Ruins** (Lower Dura, Fallen)                 | You wake up in the ruins of a collapsed temple, half-buried under loose stones. Scattered offerings of silver and old flowers suggest it's still in use. You hear footsteps approaching.                                                          | **Brother Tern-9** (Warforged priest of the Sovereign Host, calm and measured. “Perhaps the gods placed you here for a reason, traveler.”)                                   |
| 4   | **The Azure Gateway** (Upper Menthis, University District)     | You appear in a private library and arcane study space near Morgrave University, where scholars conduct experiments on magical wards. However, the wards are failing, and the resident arcanists are arguing about strange occurrences on campus. | **Magister Olinna Veks** (Human abjurer, pale and sweating. “The protections are unraveling. If Morgrave can’t hold its own wards, what does that mean for the rest of us?”) |
| 5   | **A Smuggler’s Warehouse** (The Upper Cogs)                    | You land among crates marked with House Tarkanan’s sigil, full of contraband. A group of smugglers is mid-deal and you were not invited.                                                                                                          | **Sailen Valt** (Drow smuggler, dangerous but curious. “You’re either the worst spy in Sharn or just the dumbest. Either way, I want answers.”)                              |
| 6   | **Classic Theater** (Middle Menthis, Smoky Towers)             | You appear mid-performance on a massive theater stage. A packed audience of Sharn’s wealthiest patrons gasps in confusion. The spotlight is on you.                                                                                               | **Madame Solvara** (Elf playwright and illusionist, thrilled by drama. “What an entrance! Now, dear, what’s your monologue?”)                                                |

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

**General:**
 - [ ]  While no widespread calamities have occurred yet, magic has started behaving strangely in subtle ways.
**Transmutation (A):**
 - [ ]  There used to be places in the Marches where the land itself was alive with magic — places where the trees grew strange and creatures changed in unnatural ways. But now? Nothing. Just untouched wilderness, like it was never there.
 - [ ]  I heard of a relic deep in the Shadow Marches — an obelisk that shows visions of a world that never was. People say it’s just an illusion, but some claim they’ve seen reflections of themselves… changed, as if they had lived another life.
 - [ ]  They say certain spells don’t work right anymore. Transmutation magic just… fails, like the world forgot how to change. And the strangest part? No one can remember when it started.
 - [ ]  **Path of Light**: The cycle of transformation is missing. All things should grow, evolve, and change, yet the world remains static where it should flow. Something has severed the natural order, leaving only echoes of what once was.
**Enchantment (B):**
 - [ ]  No one’s heard from a certain village in Aundair for months. No letters, no travelers — just silence. People who go to check on it? They don’t come back.
 - [ ]  A powerful mage passed through a small town not long ago, and since then, no one has left. No letters, no travelers.
 - [ ]  Something’s wrong with enchantment magic. Spells that once soothed the mind or bent wills simply fail, and those who relied on charm or persuasion find their words ringing hollow.
 - [ ]  **Path of Light**: To manipulate the mind is to imprison the soul. Aundair hides a wound where memory is stolen, and those trapped within are kept from walking the path toward enlightenment.
**Abjuration (C):**
 - [ ]  Morgrave University’s wards are failing. Spells that have held for centuries are unraveling, and no one knows why.
 - [ ]  They’ve shut down entire wings of Morgrave’s libraries. Some say it’s a security risk, but others whisper that even the simplest protective spells won’t hold anymore.
 - [ ]  A scholar in Morgrave swore he had the perfect defense against magical attacks. He tested it last week. It didn’t work. He’s dead.
 - [ ]  **Path of Light**: Protection is the foundation of balance. When the barriers between forces break, entropy follows. Something unseen is unraveling the world’s safeguards, and none can stand against what is to come.
**Evocation (D):**
 - [ ]  Something burned through the arcane wards at Rekkenmark. They say the entire building shook like a storm was trapped inside, and not a single apprentice who witnessed it has spoken since.
 - [ ]  A military outpost near Rekkenmark was completely leveled — burned to the ground in an instant. No one saw what did it, and there were no signs of a battle.
 - [ ]  There was an accident at the university — so they claim. But survivors talk of spellcasters who lost control, their power turning on them, as if the magic itself had been taken over.
 - [ ]  **Path of Light**: Mana is not meant to be wielded as a weapon of reckless fury. In Karrnath, destruction grows wild, unbound from order, threatening to sever the flow of life itself.
**Divination (E):**
 - [ ]  The King’s Dark Lanterns are arresting people before they even commit crimes. They claim they ‘saw’ the guilt in their future, but how can fate be judged before it even unfolds?
 - [ ]  A high-ranking noble in Wroat fled the city, claiming someone ‘saw’ something in her future she didn’t like. No one knows where she went, but the Lanterns are hunting her.
 - [ ]  The King’s Wands have been acting strangely. Their leader, Captain Nebik, speaks of visions — he says he can see everything before it happens. But his eyes look hollow, as if something else is staring through them.
 - [ ]  **Path of Light**: To see is not always to understand. True vision flows with the light of Irian, yet in Wroat, something twists the future into chains, binding the world to paths it was never meant to walk.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Rough leveling plan:
	- 9th level soon after arriving in Khorvaire (after finding their way out of the initial location)
	- 11th level after completing the first five adventures (at second plot point)
	- 13th level after completing the second five adventures (at the third plot point)
	- 15th level after completing the final two adventures prior to the finale
- Oriq Blood Mage stat block is CR 9, so should be used for the regular Oriq agents encountered during the following adventures.
- Use the Extus Narr stat block from Strixhaven Supplemental for Malakar (CR 16). Then he summons the Blood Avatar (CR 21).
