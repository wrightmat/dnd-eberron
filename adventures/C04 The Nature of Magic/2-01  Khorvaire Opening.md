### Background and Hook(s)

* Have each player roll a d4 and drop them in a different location across central Khorvaire based on the roll (with a 4 being a re-roll or DM/player choice). Then they either need to find a way to get back to each other, communicate with each other, or gather their own information about what's going on in their location.
* The players’ first goal becomes clear: discover why their magic was drained and seek a way to restore it. Initial exploration uncovers a fragment of a dragonshard imbued with unusual magical energy, pointing toward nexuses of power tied to the schools of magic.

### Characters and Locations

* 

* **[[Arcanix]], Aundair**
* **[[Fairhaven]], Aundair**
* **[[Stormhome]], Aundair**

### Scenes and Situations

###### 1. Arcanix
 - [ ] 
- The primary point of interest here should be the Floating Towers, where any player landing here could get information about magic.
- Players landing here could also learn immediately about the troubles with Divination magic in the area, and the recent issues with the Eye of Siberys.

###### 2. Fairhaven
 - [ ] 
- The primary point of interest should be the University of Wynarn, where any player landing here could get information about magic.

###### 3. Stormhome
 - [ ] 
- Players landing here would immediately notice that storms have racked the island. If asking around, they'd learn that until recently, magic controlled the weather here but that magic is no longer working. The Raincallers Guild Hall would be the place to ask about that.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Malakar’s ultimate goal is to consume all mana, transcending mortality and becoming a godlike being beyond the Sovereigns’ reach.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Rough leveling plan:
	- 9th level upon arriving to Khorvaire
	- 11th level after completing the first five adventures (at second plot point)
	- 13th level after completing the second five adventures (at the third plot point)
	- 15th level after completing the final two adventures prior to the finale
- Oriq Blood Mage stat block is CR 9, so should be used for the regular Oriq agents encountered during the following adventures.
- Create custom stat blocks for the Oriq lieutenants (look to Wildemont for dunamancy monsters).
- Use the Extus Narr stat block from Strixhaven Supplemental for Malakar (CR 16). Then he summons the Blood Avatar (CR 21).
