### Background and Hook(s)

* The eldritch machines that serve the various needs of the city of Verthicha'vivex have been sabotaged by the chaos magic of the Oriq second lieutenant Zaelith T'Kaarn, who has returned the crystals that power the machines back to their home planes. The PCs will need to enter planar portals that have been ripped through the fabric of reality by chaos magic to visit each plane and retrieve its crystal.

### Characters and Locations

* **Zaelith T'Kaarn** (non-gendered githzerai entropomancer). Malakar's second lieutenant, the Herald of Chaos, and a githzerai who came to Strixhaven from Kythri to study and refine chaos magic. Their work led them to experiment with chaotic energies, eventually embracing the school of entropomancy. Their experiments caused a massive explosion, destroying their lab and scattering magical fallout across the region. This event caught Malakar’s attention, and he recruited Zaelith as his second lieutenant, tasking them with sowing chaos and destabilizing the magical infrastructure of Eberron. Their appearance is unsettling: glowing, jagged cracks run across their ashen skin, shifting with an inner light like molten metal, and their silver eyes seem to ripple with chaotic energy. They wear frayed, iridescent robes that constantly shift in color and texture, and their form occasionally flickers, as if caught between dimensions.

* **Verthicha'vivex, Argonnessen**. Draconic for "Mountain of Victory", this fortress city is the headquarters of the Light of Siberys.

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ] 
- Towering golden structures stretch endlessly in symmetrical rows. The air hums with the ticking of unseen gears, and celestial beings move in perfect synchronization.
- **Key Location**: The Hall of Arbitration, a grand courthouse where every action is recorded and judged. The crystal is held in an evidence vault, requiring proper authorization.
- **Challenge**:
	- The PCs must petition for the crystal, presenting their case before a tribunal of inevitables.
	- Every argument must be logically sound, or the bureaucratic process resets, requiring them to start over.
	- Any attempt to steal the crystal triggers an endless legal loop, where the PCs are put on trial for theft before they can even act.
- **Retrieving the Crystal**: The PCs must find and exploit a loophole in Daanvi’s strict laws, proving that the crystal already belongs to them.

###### 2. Dolurrh (The Realm of the Dead)
 - [ ] 
- A colorless expanse of mist and stillness stretches before the PCs. The landscape is filled with **silent, wandering souls**, their faces blank and memories lost.

- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must **restore a lost memory** by piecing together fragments of forgotten lives.
    - If they fail, they begin to **lose their own memories**, forgetting spells, abilities, or even their purpose in this mission.
    - The longer they remain, the more they risk **becoming one of Dolurrh’s nameless dead**.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** They must **recover the erased name** in the book where the crystal is stored—without it, the crystal remains intangible.

###### 3. Fernia (The Sea of Fire)
 - [ ] 
- A burning wasteland of **cracked obsidian and rivers of magma**. In the distance, a colossal forge belches molten sparks into the sky.
- **Key Location:** The **Smoldering Crucible**, where fire elementals and giants craft weapons. The crystal is suspended within a pillar of flame.
- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must **prove their strength** — either by defeating a **fire giant champion** or forging a **legendary weapon** to be deemed worthy.
    - The forge’s heat is unbearable, and **any failure results in exhaustion** or burns.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** Only those recognized by the Crucible may claim the crystal — through battle or by crafting a masterpiece.

###### 4. Irian (The Eternal Dawn)
 - [ ] 
- A realm bathed in **warm golden light**, filled with floating landmasses that are still forming, as if creation itself is incomplete.
- **Key Location:** The **Unfinished Vault**, a temple where a statue of an unknown figure is being sculpted. The crystal is embedded in the unfinished form.
- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must **complete the statue**, sculpting a missing feature.
    - The form they create determines the crystal’s response—**if they sculpt a falsehood, the crystal rejects them**.
    - If they refuse to finish the statue, the vault collapses, forcing them to flee before the crystal is lost forever.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** The **statue must be completed with an honest truth** about the PCs’ mission or their own desires.

###### 5. Lamannia (The Twilight Forest)

###### 6. Mabar (The Endless Night)
 - [ ]

- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must **anchor the city to reality** by restoring memories of it.
    - If they fail, they begin losing pieces of themselves, forgetting details about their own past.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** They must remember the city’s name — without it, the monument and the crystal will vanish forever.

###### 7. Risia (The Plain of Ice)
 - [ ] 
- A tundra of endless ice, where time is frozen in place. Footprints vanish instantly, and breath lingers in the air unnaturally.
- **Key Location:** The **Frozen Echo**, a glacier that contains moments trapped in time.
- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must interact with frozen moments, reliving a past or future event that may or may not be real.
    - Breaking the ice improperly causes time itself to collapse, trapping them in a time loop.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** To claim the crystal, they must shatter a vision of their own deaths, losing the memory in the process.

###### 8. Shavarath (The Battleground)
 - [ ] 
- An endless battlefield, where warriors fight in an eternal war. The sky is filled with war machines and the clash of steel.
- **Key Location:** The **Eternal Siege**, a fortress under constant attack. The crystal is held by a warlord inside.

- **Key Location:** The **Bridge of Ascension**, a shattered pathway leading to the crystal’s resting place.
- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must find a way across, as flight does not work properly.
    - They can attempt to rebuild the bridge, create an impossible leap, or navigate an alternate path through unseen forces.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** Once the bridge is completed or bypassed through ingenuity, the crystal manifests.

###### 10. Thelanis (The Feywild)
 - [ ] 
- A grand fey court is frozen in time, the figures within locked in the middle of conversation, dance, and music. The air thrums with magic.
- **Key Location:** The **Gilded Court**, where a fey noble holds the crystal in their outstretched hand, as if waiting for an offer.
- **Challenge:**
    - The crystal cannot be taken by force — it must be won through a bargain or a contest of wit.
    - The noble offers a game — a riddle, a dance, or a wager — but the stakes are unclear until it is too late.
    - If the players fail or refuse, they are trapped in the court’s frozen moment, repeating their actions forever.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** The PCs must outwit or outmaneuver the noble while ensuring they don’t promise something they cannot afford to lose.

###### 11. Xoriat (The Realm of Madness)
 - [ ] 
- Reality breaks apart, reforming into something new with every breath. The PCs step into a space that is half-formed — a landscape midway through becoming something, its rules uncertain.
- **Key Location:** The **Unfinished Thought**, a massive, impossible structure that shifts between forms — a castle, a city street, a childhood home. The crystal is in a room that does not yet exist.
- **Challenge:**
    - The PCs must construct reality by focusing on what they expect to see, shaping the path forward.
    - Each PC may perceive things differently — one sees a bridge, another sees a chasm, and both are correct.
    - If they contradict each other too much, the plane rejects them, warping their own minds in response.
- **Retrieving the Crystal:** The crystal exists in a place that does not exist yet — they must name it, describe it, and then step into it to make it real.

###### 12. Kythri (Zaelith’s Lair)
 - [ ] 
- Floating landmasses drift unpredictably, and gravity shifts randomly. Colors, sounds, and even **causality itself distort**, bending reality in unexpected ways.
- **Key Location:** The **Shifting Spiral**, a chaotic domain where **Zaelith T’Kaarn** waits, reveling in instability. The final crystal floats above an unstable vortex.
- **Challenge:**
    - **Zaelith warps reality** mid-combat, **shifting gravity, distorting time, and altering space**.
    - The battlefield itself **changes every round**, making positioning difficult.
    - Time fractures, causing players to **experience their actions out of order**, forcing them to plan around unpredictable cause-and-effect loops.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Many of these planar visits should be quite short, as we don't want to just repeat the first campaign.
- Focus on any that have a connection to a PC though, like especially Lamannia (for Shear).
- Definitely use the Wild Mange as an enemy.
- All of these were written my ChatGPT - still need lots of review and refinement.
