### Background and Hook(s)

* The eldritch machines that serve the various needs of the city of Verthicha'vivex have been sabotaged by the chaos magic of the Oriq second lieutenant Zaelith T'Kaarn, who has returned the crystals that power the machines back to their home planes. The PCs will need to enter planar portals that have been ripped through the fabric of reality by chaos magic to visit each plane and retrieve its crystal.

### Characters and Locations

* **Zaelith T'Kaarn** (non-gendered githzerai entropomancer). Malakar's second lieutenant, the Herald of Chaos, and a githzerai who came to Strixhaven from Kythri to study and refine chaos magic. Their work led them to experiment with chaotic energies, eventually embracing the school of entropomancy. Their experiments caused a massive explosion, destroying their lab and scattering magical fallout across the region. This event caught Malakarâ€™s attention, and he recruited Zaelith as his second lieutenant, tasking them with sowing chaos and destabilizing the magical infrastructure of Eberron. Their appearance is unsettling: glowing, jagged cracks run across their ashen skin, shifting with an inner light like molten metal, and their silver eyes seem to ripple with chaotic energy. They wear frayed, iridescent robes that constantly shift in color and texture, and their form occasionally flickers, as if caught between dimensions.

* **Verthicha'vivex, Argonnessen**. Draconic for "Mountain of Victory", this fortress city is the headquarters of the Light of Siberys.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Many of these planar visits should be quite short, as we don't want to just repeat the first campaign.
- Focus on any that have a connection to a PC though, like especially Lamannia (for Shear).
- The final battle with the Oriq second lieutenant should be in Kythri (plane of chaos).
- Definitely use the Wild Mange as an enemy.
