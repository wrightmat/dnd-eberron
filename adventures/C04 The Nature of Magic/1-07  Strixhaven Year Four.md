### Background and Hook(s)

* As the fourth and final year of the characters’ academic career at Strixhaven dawns, the university faces a crisis. In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does the Oriq threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university’s masters are powerless against the villains. It becomes clear that the characters must drop their studies and stop them at all costs.
* While the Strixhaven faculty investigate the Oriq and their schemes, it becomes clear that the villains have warded themselves from their spells so student aid will be needed to defeat them. The characters are called on to help track the villains to their lair - the Fortress Badlands and the even further yet Ruins of Caerdoon - and stop their wicked plans. But Malakar has other plans...

### Scenes and Situations

#### Week 1: Final Return

###### Student Schedules
 - [ ] 
- Before starting this adventure, have the players choose at least three courses their characters are taking this year, either by coming up with the courses themselves or by rolling on the Fourth-Year Courses table. Inform them that the characters are also enrolled in a required course, Arcane Herbology.
- [[other/Strixhaven University#Courses|Courses]]

###### A Sinister Shadow
 - [ ] 
- Once the characters have cemented their fourth-year Extracurriculars, Jobs, and Relationships decisions as needed, it’s time to kick off this adventure.
- When the characters arrive for their final year at Strixhaven, the mood is muted. Social spaces are sparsely populated, students chat in whispered tones, and the campus’s energy is tense. Read or paraphrase the following when you’re ready to begin the adventure:
>All of your hard work has come down to this — your fourth and final year as a student of magic at Strixhaven University. But as soon as you arrive on campus, it’s clear that something is very wrong.
>Instead of the usual cheerful bustle, students mill about campus nervously. Here and there, you hear frightened whispers: “I heard they're called the Oriq. I heard they want to hurt us all.”
>The rumor mill has apparently discovered the grave events that happened last academic term.

- At this point, the characters might be waiting on the faculty to discover more about Oriq plans. However, they also might want to take this investigation into their own hands.

###### A Brief Distraction
 - [ ] 
- While the characters wait to learn more about the Oriq, they discover some of their fellow students engaged in a game at Firejolt Café on the central campus. One of the characters’ Friends or Rivals is part of this scene, or you may choose another random student. When you’re ready to begin the scene, read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the name of the chosen student:
>The mood on campus might be gloomy, but as you cross the central campus, you see a few of your classmates smiling and gesturing outside Firejolt Café.
>A familiar face jogs up to you, waving and smiling in relief. “It’s so good to see you! Things have been dire around here lately, but some friends are inside about to start playing a game they call Scufflecup. Apparently, they found a box of animated teacups, and they figured out how to control the little buggers! Come on, let’s go check it out!”

###### Scufflecup
 - [ ] 
- Scufflecup is a game students created after finding a box of teacups in a nearby building’s storage room. The students discovered that pouring hot tea into the cups animates them for 10 minutes and causes them to sprout little arms and legs. While animate, a cup uses the Scufflecup teacup stat block and does the bidding of whoever animated it.
- Characters who enter Firejolt Café find that the fireside lounge (area F5) has been rearranged into a play area for a game of Scufflecup. A student explains the game, which is played on the large table in the lounge’s center. The square tabletop is 5 feet on each side. The student who describes how to play is a character’s Friend, Rival, or Beloved.
- **Scufflecup Rules**. Each participant fills a teacup with hot tea and places it on the table. The participants then roll initiative. At least one Scufflecup participant is a student who isn’t a player character. On each of their turns, a participant can use a bonus action to mentally command their teacup either to attack another teacup within range or to try to shove another teacup off the table, using the rules for shoving in the Player’s Handbook. A participant loses the game if their teacup drops to 0 hit points or if their teacup falls off the table. The participant with the last cup standing wins. The winner receives a purse of donations from the crowd that totals 1,000 gp.
- **Cheering and Heckling**. A character who doesn’t want to participate in the game can contribute in one of the following ways:
	- **Cheer a Participant**. A character can encourage one of the game’s participants. That participant’s teacup gains advantage on its attack rolls.
	- **Heckle a Participant**. A character can taunt one of the game’s participants. That participant’s teacup has disadvantage on its attack rolls.

#### Week 3: Arcane Herbology Exam: Vegetation Identification

- The first Exam for Arcane Herbology takes place a few weeks after the characters’ Scufflecup game in Firejolt Café. Students must identify unlabeled groupings of different plants, lichens, and fungi. Like the course itself, this Exam is conducted in an outdoor lab located in Sedgemoor.
- Arcane Herbology covers techniques for using flora in potions, spells, and rituals. The course’s professor is Verelda Lang, an arcano-biologist whom the characters might recall from their first year of instruction.

###### Studying Phase
 - [ ] 
- The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.
- Once you’ve asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 20 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters’ rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

###### Testing Phase
 - [ ] 
- On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:
	- **Flora’s Arcane Properties**. Correctly selecting the properties of samples requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check.
	- **Specimen Identification**. Recalling the correct names of flora with arcane uses based on sight, smell, and texture requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check.
- Have each player note their character’s Exam results — how many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the test — on their copies of the tracking sheet.

###### Moving On
 - [ ] 
At the end of the characters’ first Exam in Professor Lang’s class, she takes them aside with a grave look on her face. She waits for the other students to leave the room before she addresses the characters:
>"I've been studying Dean Tullus's strange orb since the events of last year, and while we still don't know everything, we're learning more and more every day and believe it may be tied to a very old group who have been against Strixhaven for some time."
>“Our best faculty researchers are digging through Strixhaven’s past trying to find anything helpful, but we could use your help searching for clues. I’ve arranged for you to lead an expedition to the Fortress Badlands, where Tullus found the orb. Needless to say, there’s extra credit in it for you if you’ll help us once again.”

- Once the characters are ready to venture into the Fortress Badlands, Professor Lang provides directions but warns the characters that this location might be dangerous. Although Dean Tullus didn’t run into any problems there, it’s likely that someone led her to the orb and removed any threats that might impede his plan to manipulate her.
- Indeed, the Fortress Badlands have become a haven for acolytes of Oriq teachings and their thralls. Both the Ruins of Caerdoon and the Fortress Badlands (servings as a sort of gateway to the former) are located between the two large mountain ranges south of Fang Crater (and north of Io'lokar) in The Vast.

#### Week 6: Into the Badlands

- When the characters arrive at the Fortress Badlands, located 20 miles off campus, read or paraphrase the following:
>Jutting from the cracked earth ahead of you is a network of reddish sandstone hillocks. Three wooden guard towers flank a trail that leads through the hills. Each tower sports a knotted line of glistening rope ascending twenty feet to a broad, winged kite.

- Characters approaching from the south get a clear look at the watchtowers. The smaller, central tower has a lone, unmoving sentry. Characters who observe the towers through a spyglass or succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check note that the “sentry” appears to be a mannequin wearing a broad-brimmed sun hat. The kites and sentry are detailed in area T1.
- **Fortress Badlands Features**. Unless noted otherwise, entryways and ceilings in the caves are 10 feet high, and the caves are lit by continual flame spells cast on wall sconces.

###### T1. Watchtowers
 - [ ] 
- Three of these rickety structures stand in a line running west to east, and each is 20 feet tall.
- **Sentry**. The sentry posted in the smaller, central tower is a spectator perched atop a mannequin. The spectator’s eye stalks are hidden by a sun hat. The blood mage Y’demi summoned the spectator as a guardian after she grew weary of lazy Humanoid lackeys. (For more information about Y’demi, see area U4)
- When alerted to intruders or danger, the spectator detaches from the mannequin while telepathically warning intruders to leave immediately or face annihilation. Creatures that don’t comply are attacked.
- **Kites**. The three kites are hideous amalgamations of flesh and bone that serve as aerial defenders. As a bonus action, Y’demi or the spectator can make the kites attack intruders. Damaging an inert kite also activates it, as does attacking the line of entrails that attaches the kite to its watchtower. When a kite activates, its entrails detach from the watchtower and slither up into the creature’s body. The kite then attacks until destroyed or called off by Y’demi. Each kite uses the peryton stat block.

`encounter: 1: Spectator`
`encounter: 3: Peryton`

###### T2. Collapsing Cave
 - [ ] 
>Gentle, white light emanates from within the mouth of this cave. The mouth is fifteen feet across and ten feet high, but the cave narrows as it deepens.

- The northeastern alcove of this cave holds old collections of brined and preserved lab specimens from decades researching life and death. If any creature other than an Oriq moves more than 10 feet into the cave, a defensive sigil (written in blood) detonates on the ceiling, causing a cave-in. A character who moves 5 feet into the cave can detect this sigil with a successful DC 17 Perception (Wisdom) check, and they can disable it with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. Failing the check by 5 or more causes the sigil to detonate.
- If the sigil detonates, each creature in the cave must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained by debris. On a successful saving throw, they take half as much damage and aren’t knocked prone or restrained. A creature can use an action to try to pull itself or another creature it can reach out of the debris, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature freed from the debris is no longer restrained by it. The cave-in destroys the collection of lab specimens.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the northernmost wall of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend in with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a small, secret chamber.
- **Treasure**. The secret chamber is unlit and holds a stash of easily transportable valuables, which the Oriq keep here in case one has to flee the badlands in a hurry. These valuables are in plain view along the north wall:
	- A [[ring of mind shielding]] in a metal jewelry box (the ring holds the soul of a troll mage named Kallanthus, who is afraid to leave the ring and travel to the afterlife)
	- A [[cloak of elvenkind]] crafted from woven vines

**Hall of Wisdom (T3A-T3E)**
This winding network of tunnels and alcoves holds collections of books, scrolls, and curios, which are heaped on shelves and in niches along the cave walls. This area has four entry points, each with its own collection of items. The shadow demons in area T3E investigate any loud noises coming from the neighboring areas.

###### T3A. Southeast Entrance
 - [ ] 
>The floor of this open cave is strewn with the bones of small birds, reptiles, and wild dogs.

- The animal bones are the remains of Murgaxor’s, Y’demi’s, and Malakar's past meals.

###### T3B. Southwest Entrance
 - [ ] 
>Books and scroll cases are tucked in nooks along the west wall of this open cave. Many of the book spines and scroll cases bear the Strixhaven star.

- Items bearing the Strixhaven star were stolen from the university. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check while searching the collection finds several annotated books about the Caerdoon region, located a few miles from the badlands. The annotations, sloppily written in Common, deal with locating sites of large battles and how best to explore those locations.
- **Treasure**. Characters who spend at least 10 minutes searching this area find a [[spell scroll]] of *fear* and a [[spell scroll]] of *false life*.

###### T3C. Empty Chamber
 - [ ] 
- This empty chamber has short tunnels connecting it to area T3B to the south, area T3D to the north, and area T3E to the east.

###### T3D. Northwest Entrance
 - [ ] 
>This open cave and its walls hold racks of weapons and spellcasting foci, including orbs, animal fetishes, carved stones, and the like.

- The spellcasting foci stored here aren’t magical, but one is an obsidian orb cut in the motif of an ancient troll civilization. This orb would fetch 300 gp from a collector.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the east wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend in with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens into a smaller secret room.
- **Treasure**. The secret room is unlit and once held the Oriq's most prized arcane texts, most of which have been moved to various places (Ruins of Caerdoon, Wiltroot Hall, etc). The remaining texts — of which there are twelve stacked in two piles of six — are still valuable. The university would pay 500 gp for their safe return.

###### T3E. East Entrance
 - [ ] 
>Ineptly painted portraits hang on the walls of this shadowy cave. Stairs cut into the north wall lead down to a lower level.

- Four shadow demons hide in the shadows of this cave. They attack visitors who aren’t accompanied by an Oriq. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher spot the shadow demons before they attack and aren’t surprised by them.
- The portraits are of a bullywug blood mage (Murgaxor, who the players would all recognize), a human (Y’demi), and a dragonborn in similar attire and mask (Malakar).
- The stairs in the north wall lead down to areas U1 through U4, detailed later in the “Underground Cave” section.

`encounter: 4: Shadow Demon`

###### T4. Supply Room
 - [ ] 
>A jumbled pile of supplies lies on the floor of this open cave and spills into a narrow hallway beyond.

- This cave holds what remains of the supplies Malakar used to explore the Ruins of Caerdoon, located just a few miles away. A character who spends at least 1 hour sifting through the tools can assemble one set of mason’s tools, two explorer’s packs, one dungeoneer’s pack, and one scholar’s pack.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the northernmost end of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a small chamber.
- **Secret Room**. The Oriq kept alchemical supplies in this unlit secret chamber. Most of the supplies have been removed except for two flasks of acid and three flasks of alchemist’s fire.

###### T5. Lab
 - [ ] 
>The pungent odors of sweet potpourri and chemical preservatives waft from this cave. Carved into the walls are shelves bearing specimen jars, notebooks, and containers of herbs and alchemical reagents. In the middle of the cave rests a smooth stone slab covered in a rusty stain.

- Malakar conducted horrific experiments here. Primarily, he worked on transferring life from one creature to another.
- A character who spends at least 30 minutes skimming the notebooks can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, piecing together the nature of the Oriq’s work on a success. What the notebooks describe lines up with the maladies that plagued Strixhaven over the last few years.
- Harmless samples of flesh are stored here in jars. However, some experiments created a few unfortunate Undead, which are described below.
- **Box of Helping Hands**. This unmarked, 2-foot-by-3-foot metal box has a simple latch keeping it closed. The box contains a dozen crawling claws. If the lid is opened, the crawling claws quickly skitter out. A character who immediately tries to close the lid can make a DC 15 Dexterity check; if the check succeeds, 1d6 crawling claws escape before the lid shuts; the others are trapped in the box, unable to escape until it is opened again.
- On their first turn in combat, crawling claws that escaped from the box scurry about the cave, knocking over jars of chemical supplies and creating a chemical mixture that fills the cave with noxious gas for 1 minute. When a creature enters the gas-filled cave for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that don’t need to breathe are immune to the gas, as are the crawling claws. A gust of wind spell or similar magic disperses the gas.

`encounter: 12: Crawling Claw`

- **Skull in a Jug**. Vargas Kancia was a Prismari student; he was researching elemental nodes in the badlands when he was abducted by Malakar, whose experiments transformed Vargas into a flameskull. Vargas rests in an unsealed, straight-sided glass jar filled with clear goo. If another creature comes within 5 feet of the jug, Vargas awakens, flies out of the jug covered in goo, and erupts in emerald flames. Vargas is confused and enraged, attacking whichever creature awakened him.
- A character can use an action to try to persuade Vargas to cease his attacks, doing so with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Once he is talked down, Vargas realizes his anger is unjustified, apologizes for his outburst, and offers to help the characters for the remainder of the adventure. Vargas’s priorities are to see Malakar brought to justice and to resume his studies at Strixhaven.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the northwest wall of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens into a cramped secret chamber.
- **Treasure**. The secret chamber is unlit and contains a set of alchemist’s supplies along with two potions of healing (greater) and one potion of poison.

###### T6. Mushroom Cave
 - [ ] 
- Characters who approach this cave without first exploring area T7 attract the attention of the gorgon lairing there, causing the creature to charge out of area T7 and attack them.
>The stench of decay wafts from this unlit cave. Inside, rows of wooden planters mounted on the walls hold a variety of fungi. A large purple mushroom grows in the northwest corner.

- The large, purple mushroom growing in the northwest corner is a shrieker, which commences shrieking when any creature that’s not Oriq approaches more than 10 feet inside the cave. The shriek is loud enough to alert the spectator in area T1, the shadow demons in area T3E, and the gorgon in area T7.

`encounter: 1: Shrieker`

- The fungi here are used in alchemical concoctions and poisons. Creatures foolish enough to eat the fungi must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the north wall of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door pulls open to reveal an unlit room containing a pair of hostile black puddings. The puddings spill out and attack as soon as the secret door is opened. Unless the characters were able to see into the room (with the aid of a *clairvoyance* spell or similar magic) before opening the door, they are surprised at the start of this encounter.

`encounter: 2: Black Pudding`

###### T7. Gorgon’s Cave
 - [ ] 
- A gorgon occupies this otherwise empty cave. Characters who come into view of the grumpy gorgon provoke its anger, causing it to attack them.

`encounter: 1: Gorgon`

#### Week 6: Underground Cave

- **Underground Cave Features**. The underground cave serves as private chambers for various Oriq. It contains space for rituals, research, and quiet contemplation. It has the following features:
	- **Bare Stone**. This cave looks naturally formed, but the stone has been shaped and smoothed by magic. The cave walls have shelves built into them.
	- **Ceilings**. The ceilings are 10 feet high and gently curved and smoothed like the walls.
	- **Light**. All areas are lit by continual flame spells cast on wall sconces.
	- **Scry-Proof**. Any attempt to magically scry on a creature, object, or location within the underground cave fails automatically.

###### U1. Meditation Alcove
 - [ ] 
>Just after a three-way intersection, the tunnel widens into an alcove. Gooey mud covers the alcove’s floor, and the air is oppressively muggy.

- Murgaxor came here to meditate and used magic to transform this alcove into a humid bog suited to his tastes.
- **Protective Muck**. Any creature that bathes in the mud for 1 minute gains `dice: 1d4 + 1` temporary hit points for 1 hour. If any temporary hit points remain when the effect expires, the affected creature takes 5 necrotic damage.

###### U2. Ritual Area
 - [ ] 
>Ritual circles drawn in fine, chalky powder cover the floor. Notebooks, scrolls, and brass braziers sit on shelves carved into the walls.

- Malakar used this area to perfect his rituals. Characters who spend 5 minutes or more reading the notebooks and who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check piece together that Malakar conducted life-draining blood magic rituals here.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens into a hallway that ends at another secret door, beyond which is area U4. From inside the hallway, characters can spot either secret door without having to make a check.

###### U3. Guard Chamber
 - [ ] 
>Two mud-caked, human-sized creatures stand inert in front of the northern exit to this chamber. Crude, articulated skulls of badlands wolves are attached to their heads. Both guards reek of death.

- Y’demi created these horrifying Undead to guard her sleeping area. Both use the ghast stat block and start combat with 5 temporary hit points, having recently bathed in area U1. The creatures attack without mercy. Combat here alerts Y’demi in area U4, and she investigates.

###### U4. Living Area
 - [ ] 
>A copper basin on a wrought-iron stand rests on the floor in the middle of this cave. A pool of smelly water fills the cave’s northwest corner.

- Malakar lived here before decamping to the Ruins of Caerdoon. Y’demi (neutral evil human Oriq blood mage) resides here now, waiting for Malakar’s imminent call to join him.
- **Copper Basin**. The copper basin contains a gallon of fresh blood. So long as she can see the basin and there’s a gallon or more of blood in it, Y’demi can use the following bonus action:
	- **Sanguine Tentacles (1/Day)**. The blood in the copper basin disappears as tentacles of congealed blood fill a 10-foot cube centered at a point on the ground that Y’demi can see within 15 feet of her. The effect lasts for 1 minute, during which time that area is difficult terrain. Any creature entering that area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the tentacles takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make either a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check or a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.

`encounter: 1: Oriq Blood Mage`

- **Roleplaying Y’demi**. Y’demi works with Malakar because she’s fascinated with his magic, but she isn’t willing to die for him.
- Y’demi fights until she loses half or more of her hit points, then makes a cutting remark as she tries to escape. Y’demi is patient and cunning. If captured, she tells the students about Malakar's trip to Caerdoon, if she thinks doing so will help keep her alive. She won’t help the party hurt him, but if a character succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation) check, she gives short, honest answers to the characters’ questions.
- **Secret Door**. A character who searches the southeast wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens to a hallway that ends at another secret door, beyond which is area U2. From inside the hallway, characters can spot either secret door without having to make a check.
- **Smelly Pool of Water**. The smelly water in the northwest pool is drinkable.

###### Developments
 - [ ] 
- The information in these areas should give a clear picture of the extent of the Oriq threat that still remains, and that the Ruins of Caerdoon should be their next target. However, since they have some time, encourage them to return to campus to make any final preparations — not to mention have one final visit with their Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds — before heading into this adventure’s final areas.

#### This Is Surreal, Isn’t It?

- If the characters return to campus before heading to the Ruins of Caerdoon, a fellow student approaches them before they leave the campus and embark on their next journey. This student should be a character’s Friend, Rival, or Beloved.
- The student looks at the characters with trepidation before giving the character they know best a hug, a pat on the shoulder, or another indication of affection. The student tells the characters they have something to show them and leads the party into Bow’s End Tavern.
- Once you’re ready to begin this event, read or paraphrase the following:
>Inside the normally raucous Bow’s End Tavern, the mood is somber. Your peers are here, and they’ve heard about your dire mission to head into the Ruins of Caerdoon. They have organized a fete, or something like it, to send you off. Banners that read “We Believe in You!” and “Heroes of Strixhaven!” hang all about the tavern. Friends tearfully wish you luck. Everyone knows what’s at stake, and they’re all counting on you.

- In addition to the characters’ Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds, this gathering includes faculty members such as Professor Verelda Lang, Instructor Arkin Minexes, Professor Brenneth Blackstone, Professor Mavinda Sharpbeak, and others at your discretion.

###### Relationships: Before We Go
 - [ ] 
- This scene is the final opportunity for the characters to interact with their fellow students on campus before this adventure’s climax and conclusion. As such, this Relationship encounter is more free-form than others.
- Since this is the last such encounter before the adventure’s finale, this scene should be of personal importance to each character. If a player wishes to cement a Beloved Relationship when they normally couldn’t or gain a Friend even if they don’t have enough Relationship Points, allow them to do so to reflect the poignant nature of this moment.
- For example, a character who wishes to have a final moment with a deeply romantic Beloved might sneak up onto the roof of the Biblioplex to have a heart-to-heart under the stars. Another character might want to share a deeply personal story from their childhood with their Friend or Beloved before giving that individual a treasured keepsake.

#### Ruins of Caerdoon

Although members of Lorehold College have been known to visit the Ruins of Caerdoon on archaeology expeditions, the area is far from safe or well explored. Most of the fortress has fallen to ruin, but potent magic and sturdy construction have left enough stone standing to make it defensible. Notable features are summarized below:
- **Desecrated Earth**. The area is awash in necrotic energy. Undead here have advantage on saving throws against being turned.
- **Fortress Walls**. The fortress looks like a blast of energy blew the top two-thirds of it away. The walls are roughly 10 feet high and 2 feet thick unless otherwise specified.
- **Illumination**. No light sources are present in the ruins, which are illuminated by sunlight during the day and moonlight at night.
- **Trees**. The trees here are gnarled and have discolored leaves.

###### N1. Haunted Watchtower
 - [ ] 
- The fortress used to have multiple watchtowers covering all approaches but now has only one battered tower near the south road. A wraith — the tormented remnant of a long-dead garrison commander — stands watch. When it detects visitors, the wraith lets out a shriek that puts the ruins on alert and activates the necromantic barrier described in area N2.
- A character who wants to sneak past the watchtower or climb its ladder undetected must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If multiple party members attempt the same task, have them make a group check instead.

`encounter: 1: Wraith`

###### N2. Wailing Moat
 - [ ] 
>Hundreds of voices wail in rage and frustration from a moat of viscid slime that surrounds the crumbling ruins. At the fortress’s southern tip, a shattered bridge droops over the sludge, a ten-foot-wide hole smashed through its center.

- Hundreds of soldiers died in ages past assaulting the walls of Caerdoon, and their moss-covered bones rest at the bottom of the fortress’s moat.
- **Shield of the Fallen**. When a creature not approved by Malakar moves within 10 feet of the moat, a 40-foot-high, 1-inch-thick dome of opaque necrotic energy erupts from the middle of the moat to enclose the ruined fortress (area N6).
- When the dome appears, read the following:
>A wall of writhing darkness climbs forty feet in the air, forming an opaque dome around the ruins.

- Any creature in or above the moat when the dome appears must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:5d8` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creature chooses if it’s inside or outside the dome. The dome deals `dice:5d8` necrotic damage to any creature that touches it. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.
- Nothing can physically pass through the dome unless certain conditions are met, as explained below. However, the dome doesn’t block ethereal creatures or prevent the use of spells such as dimension door or teleport.
- The dome is impervious to most damage. However, a character who examines the dome and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check ascertains that it’s possible to make a temporary hole in the dome by dealing radiant damage to it, and that a skilled arcanist can manipulate the dome’s magical harmonics to make it susceptible to other damage types, as well (as described below).
- Dealing at least 25 radiant damage to the dome with an attack or a spell creates a 10-foot-diameter hole in it. Appearing at the point where the attack or spell made first contact with the dome, this hole remains open for 1 minute.
- A character can try to manipulate the dome’s arcane harmonics by using an action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the character can switch the requisite damage type from radiant to another type chosen from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, piercing, slashing, or thunder. The change in requisite damage type lasts until the end of the character’s next turn.

###### N3. Wreckage
 - [ ] 
>The twisted wreckage of siege weapons litters the area. Ballistas, catapults, and even a trebuchet lie together in a tangled pile.

- The broken siege weapons form a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-long barricade.
- **Catapult Munition**. A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a catapult munition roughly the size and weight of a cannonball amid the wreckage. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the munition is powerful enough to damage the Shield of the Fallen in area N2, provided the dome’s magical harmonics are altered so that the dome becomes susceptible to fire damage.
- The munition can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes on impact. Any creature within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:10d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, each object in that area that isn’t being worn or carried takes 35 (10d6) fire damage.

###### N4. Supply Train
 - [ ] 
>The pulverized remains of a military supply train are heaped alongside the trail leading to the fortress.

- The wreckage of a supply train forms a 5-foot-high, 25-foot-long barrier. Climbing atop the wreckage requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

###### N5. Siege Towers
 - [ ] 
>The remains of two mighty siege towers lie flattened near the moat’s edge. The scorch marks of battle can be seen on the wood and steel even after hundreds of years.

- The area covered by wreckage is difficult terrain.
- Six wights crawl out of the wreckage if the characters move or rummage through it. When the wights appear, read:
>A half dozen long-dead soldiers crawl out from underneath the wreckage and get to their feet, their faces grim with determination as they unsheathe their rusty swords.

`encounter: 6: Wight`

- The wights take their orders from the wraith in area N1, and the wraith has instructed the wights to attack trespassers on sight. However, a character who calls for a cessation of hostilities can, with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince the wights not to attack on their next turn and answer a few questions instead. This ploy works once, after which further calls for peace fall on deaf ears. Questions the wights can answer include the following:
	- Where is Malakar now? “Probably in the basement under the ruins. He's looking for something.” (The wights point toward area N6.)
	- Have you seen Malakar recently? “When last we saw him, he was scribing magical glyphs in the ruins.” (The wights are referring to the glyphs of warding in area N6.)
	- Why are you on Malakar’s side? “He has achieved mastery over life and death. There is no better lord to command this ruined fortress.”
	- What do you know about the ruined fortress? “We died defending it, and we defend it still.”
	- Will you help defeat Malakar or the Oriq? “No.”

###### N6. Fortress
 - [ ] 
>Little remains of the once-proud fortress. Only ten feet or so of the walls remain, worn and bleached by time and weather.

- Khelvor the daemogoth patrols the fortress, eager to defend Malakar in exchange for all the sweet suffering that’s about to occur. He is a cunning, self-serving sadist. If drawn to combat, the daemogoth should only fight to about half HP, and then flee - he's needed later when Malakar teleports away (area M6).
- **Glyphs of Warding**. In each 5-foot square marked X on map 6.4 is a glyph of warding placed by Malakar. Finding each glyph requires a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the wights in area N5 warned the characters about the glyphs, checks made to find them have advantage.
- Once a glyph is found, a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check disables it. Otherwise, the glyph triggers the first time a creature enters the 5-foot square, activating a hypnotic pattern spell (save DC 16) centered on the glyph.

`encounter: 1: Daemogoth`

- **Necrotic Locus**. In the middle of the fortress is a disgusting orb of bone, flesh, and necrotic energy. The first time a character sees it, read:
>Pained eyes bulge from a 5-foot-diameter sphere of glistening muscle, ashen skin, and yellowed bone. Oily vapor issues from six mouths on the surface of the sphere, which sits pulsing on the ground.

- A character who examines the sphere and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check ascertains that it powers the dome around the ruins (see area N2), and that its haphazard construction makes it susceptible to having its innards torn out or its magic destabilized.
- The Locus is a Medium object with AC 15; 50 hit points; a damage threshold of 15; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. The Locus can’t be moved, but it can be damaged in the following special ways:
	- **Rip Out Its Guts**. A character can reach inside the Locus through one of its mouths and try to rip out its innards with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check fails, the character is unsuccessful and takes 10 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the character takes 5 necrotic damage and deals `dice:4d10` slashing damage to the Locus, ignoring its damage threshold and resistance to slashing damage.
	- **Undo It with Magic**. A character within 5 feet of the Locus can use an action to try to overload it using an incantation taught in school. The character concludes the incantation by making an Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check fails, the character takes 5 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the Locus takes `dice:4d10` force damage, ignoring its damage threshold.
- Once the Locus is destroyed, the dome vanishes, revealing a large staircase leading down to the basement.

###### Descending to the Basement
 - [ ] 
- **Basement Features**. The Fortress of Caerdoon’s basement has the following features:
	- **Walls**. The walls are damp and made of smooth, worked stone.
	- **Ceilings**. The ceilings throughout this level are 10 feet high.
	- **Doors**. The doors are constructed of heavy wood. Each sports a simple but sturdy drop-down latch on the outside unless otherwise specified. Latched doors require a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check to batter open from the inside.
	- **Floors**. The floors are worked stone and covered with small puddles of water.
	- **Illumination**. Sconces hold torches that have continual flame spells cast on them. The sconces are spaced at 20-foot intervals along the walls.

###### M1. Central Chamber
 - [ ] 
>Torches illuminate a spacious chamber that has crates and boxes stashed in its corners. Five stout, wooden doors line the chamber’s south wall. Soggy texts and scrolls lie in puddles on the floor. To the north, you hear a loud rustling sound.

- Malakar's digging through items in the treasury (area M6) is the source of the sound. If the characters make any loud noises here, Malakar notices their presence, although he remains in area M6.
- The soggy books and blank scrolls lying in puddles on the floor were used by Malakar to prepare for his ritual; they no longer have any value. Any player doing an Investigation check may find any of the following clues from the scraps (written in Draconic and partially destroyed, but still readable):
	- DC 12: A scribbled note: “Final preparation: the artifact will complete the sigil at the Snarl’s core.”
	- DC 15: A bloodstained letter from an Oriq agent: “Our work here is done, Master. Strixhaven’s heart remains unguarded. The moment approaches.”
	- DC 18: An unfinished Oriq research entry: “The Snarl: The heart of Strixhaven’s power, hidden in plain sight.”
	- DC 20: A list of magical sites with the Biblioplex circled in red ink.
- **Crates**. A character who spends 1 minute searching the crates can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check, find one of the following useful concoctions. Only one of each concoction can be found here:
	- **Alchemist’s Doom**. Stored in a flask, this concoction is alchemist’s fire, except it deals 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of the target’s turns.
	- **Elixir of Life**. Whoever drinks this concoction gains advantage on death saving throws for 24 hours.

###### M2. Munition Storage
 - [ ] 
- These rooms were once used to store volatile munitions. A character who spends 1 minute searching one of these rooms can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, finding one of the following items on a success. No more than two of each item can be found:
	- **Bomb**. See “Explosives” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more information on bombs.
	- **Catapult Munition**. This device looks like a cannonball and weighs as much as one. It functions like the catapult munition found in area N3.

###### M3. Broken Elevator
 - [ ] 
- This room is actually the top of a shaft that once connected the fortress basement to a tunnel network below the basement. An elevator hoist is still attached to the ceiling and has frayed ropes dangling from it. Twenty feet below the door, the shaft is impassibly choked with rubble. Characters can use the dangling ropes to lower themselves down to the rubble. A search of the rubble yields nothing of value, and the elevator platform itself is buried under tons of debris.

###### M4. Ruined Storage
 - [ ] 
- Grain and other dry goods used to be stored here, but they have been consumed, leaving the room bare except for some empty sacks.

###### M5. Armory
 - [ ] 
- These rooms held weapons and armor for the fort’s defenders. What’s left is described below.
	- **North Room**. This room holds five suits of chain mail and five suits of splint armor.
	- **Center Room**. This room holds six spears, three mauls, and three glaives. The weapons are battered but functional.
	- **South Room**. This room holds five heavy crossbows and three dozen bolts.

###### M6. Treasury
 - [ ] 
- Inscribed on the walls are broken inscriptions in ancient Draconic, partially destroyed but still readable with an Intelligence (History or Arcana) check.
	- DC 10: *“Beware the Blood Ritual — what is drained cannot be restored.”*
	- DC 12: *“The Key to Godhood lies at the Source.”* (The "Source" = the Snarl)
	- DC 15: *“The Blood Avatar walks where the Weave is weakest.”*
	- DC 18: *“The Library is more than a vault — it is a Nexus.”* (Implying the Biblioplex's importance)
	- DC 20: *“The Great Convergence — when the Snarl is unbound, the world’s mana shall coalesce into the hands of the worthy.”*
- Malakar is here, digging through rubble and ancient treasures, seemingly looking for a particular artifact. When the players arrive, he finds it, and uses his magic to teleport away (monologuing first) - replacing himself with a daemogoth. Instead of teleporting with a generic effect, Malakar tears open a swirling red portal that visibly shows the Biblioplex in the background (with a successful DC 15 Perception check).
	- “Ah… so you finally caught up. You’re too late, of course. The real work begins elsewhere.”
	- “The Snarl has slumbered for too long. I will shape it to my will and transcend the gods themselves.”
	- “Run along, little students. Go back to your lectures. I have history to rewrite.”
	- “You have failed before you even knew the game was being played.”
- Once the daemogoth is destroyed, the players should return to The Biblioplex where Malakar teleported to (as clued by the inscriptions, scraps, and monologue).

`encounter: 1: daemogoth`

#### Standoff with Malakar

###### Back to Strixhaven
 - [ ] 
- As the players set foot back on their campus, they immediately see that all of their friends and fellow students are engaged in combat with a variety of Oriq members - everything from mage hunters to Oriq blood mages. But they seem to have things under control, and the more pressing matter seems to be the bright glowing magic emerging from the center of the Biblioplex.

###### The Biblioplex
 - [ ] 
* The assault on Strixhaven was the perfect misdirection for Malakar's true goals. During the ensuing chaos, he entered the Biblioplex and entered the Hall of Oracles to harness the power of the Strixhaven Snarl, a maelstrom of power left behind from the creation of the world.
* The party likely tries to intervene (or if not then one of the professors can), but are transported away the instant they get close to the Snarl.
* They land somewhere in Khorvaire, accompanied by a professor (and/or other NPCs) who was trying to help, and who can direct them to the other magical schools of Eberron so they can learn more about the nature of magic and how to take on the BBEG.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Blood magic consumes mana directly from life, severing the natural flow and leaving scars on the world.
 - [ ]  The Draconic Prophecy hints that manipulating snarls could rewrite Eberron’s destiny.
 - [ ]  The snarl at Strixhaven is unusually powerful, its energy linked to various planar forces.
 - [ ]  Mana is not infinite; hoarding it disrupts its flow, causing catastrophic imbalance.
 - [ ]  Chaos magic lies at the center of the magic circle, where all order begins to unravel.
 - [ ]  Malakar’s ultimate goal is to collect all mana, making him not just a god but the sole arbiter of magic in Eberron.
 - [ ]  The Sovereigns are not true gods, but elevated beings who mastered mana through extraordinary means.
 - [ ]  Blood magic’s origins are thought to predate even the dragons, perhaps tied to Khyber’s corruption.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Use the Detention Bog only if/when the players actually get detention!
- At the conclusion of their party at the Bow's End Tavern (see "This Is Surreal, Isn't It?") level the party up to 8th level. NB: They will level up to 9th after they leave their initial Khorvaire locations.
