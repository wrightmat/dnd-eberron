### Background and Hook(s)

* Do an in-depth scene with each player where they get their Strixhaven acceptance letter during the course of a normal day in their life. The twist is that the letter is delivered in the form of an enchanted Paper Drake that anyone but the applicant sees as a plain piece of paper (possibly like a paper airplane if flying). Each scene should consist of the Paper Drake appearing, the player needing to wrangle the Drake in order to read the letter (which causes the Drake to unfold and collapse temporarily so it can be read), and then the Drake flying off leaving behind a piece of itself with a teleportation spell (which leads to Strixhaven when the player reads it).

 - [ ]  **Cosset Theris** (Jolene)

- Opening scene should be a dream that she's having, where she's surrounded by children inside of a lavish Cyran mansion, doing nanny duties such as cooking for them and cleaning up after them. Dwell in this scene for a bit and ask Jolene what Cosset is doing with her day. Ask her the names of the children.
- When she wakes up, the new scene is a stark contrast, where she's completely alone and surrounded only by quiet.
- Ask Jolene what she's doing, and after exploring that a bit, have her find the Strixhaven acceptance letter belonging to one of the children.

 - [ ]  **Hawthorne Winters** (Kerrie)

- ASK: Does Hawthorne have any other family, besides his missing daughter?
- We see various buildings, constructed from sturdy wood and stone, with buttressed walls and arched entrances. One such building sports a simple hanging sign outside denoting it as the "Inn" (ask Kerrie the name). Inside the warmth of the fire casts shadows on the aging face of an older tiefling man.
- Ask Kerrie what Hawthorne is doing in the Inn, all by himself as the few patrons have gone to bed.
- Thunder cracks outside and lighting illuminates the room for a short time. The storms have become routine to Hawthorne, but he likes to stay awake and helpful to any patrons who may not be as familiar.
- Just as the lightning flashes again, the paper drake appears at the window. Since it's closed, the paper gets wetter and wetter as it frantically slaps its wings against the window, trying to garner any attention at all.

 - [ ]  **Alton Prescott** (Alex)

- Alton lives alone now, in a large Aundairan town called Lathleer, and the only extended family around is his ex-wife's family.
- 

 - [ ]  **Shear** (Trey)

- Open with Shear waking up in a dilapidated shine on the border of the Forsaken Forest. This is the Forsaken Shrine which Shear spends a lot of time, sometimes even spending the night near the place where he was found.
- He leaves and heads back to the town he actually lives in, Skairn.  After passing through the Driftwood Market, as he always does on his way home, he arrives at the Moonlit Forge where Brugha (the orc who essentially raised him) is working.
- After spending whatever time he'd like doing whatever he'd like with the day, Shear retires upstairs to his room. Inside of the room sits the paper drake.

 - [ ]  **Zsehissu** (Sara)
