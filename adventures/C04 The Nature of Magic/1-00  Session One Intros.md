### Background and Hook(s)

* Do an in-depth scene with each player where they get their Strixhaven acceptance letter during the course of a normal day in their life. The twist is that the letter is delivered in the form of an enchanted Paper Drake that anyone but the applicant sees as a plain piece of paper (possibly like a paper airplane if flying). Each scene should consist of the Paper Drake appearing, the player needing to wrangle the Drake in order to read the letter (which causes the Drake to unfold and collapse temporarily so it can be read), and then the Drake flying off leaving behind a piece of itself with a teleportation spell (which leads to Strixhaven when the player reads it).

 - [ ]  **Cosset Theris** (Jolene)

- Opening scene should be a dream that she's having, where she's surrounded by children inside of a lavish Cyran mansion, doing nanny duties such as cooking for them and cleaning up after them. Dwell in this scene for a bit and ask Jolene what Cosset is doing with her day. Ask her the names of the children.
	- Alis ir'Theris – The eldest, a studious and responsible child who dreamed of becoming a mage like their parents.
	- Jorren ir'Theris – The mischievous middle child, always sneaking off to explore the world beyond their family's estate.
	- Melis ir'Theris – A gentle and artistic soul, with a love for painting and storytelling.
	- Thadric ir'Theris – The bold and adventurous one, always pretending to be a Cyran knight.
	- Seraphina ir'Theris – The youngest, bright-eyed and full of endless questions about the world.
	- Vey ir'Theris – Quiet and observant, with an uncanny ability to notice things others missed.
- Ask for a History or Arcana check (DC 15), with success revealing this is a dream (continuing below) and failure continuing the dream (continue to ask questions about the scene).
- When she wakes up, the new scene is a stark contrast, where she's completely alone and surrounded only by quiet.
- Ask Jolene what she's doing, and after exploring that a bit, have her find the Strixhaven acceptance letter belonging to one of the children.

 - [ ]  **Hawthorne Winters** (Kerrie)

- We see various buildings, constructed from sturdy wood and stone, with buttressed walls and arched entrances. One such building sports a simple hanging sign outside denoting it as the "Inn" (ask Kerrie the name). Inside the warmth of the fire casts shadows on the aging face of an older tiefling man.
- Ask Kerrie what Hawthorne is doing in the Inn, all by himself as the few patrons have gone to bed.
- Thunder cracks outside and lighting illuminates the room for a short time. The storms have become routine to Hawthorne, but he likes to stay awake and helpful to any patrons who may not be as familiar.
- Just as the lightning flashes again, the paper drake appears at the window. Since it's closed, the paper gets wetter and wetter as it frantically slaps its wings against the window, trying to garner any attention at all. Ask for an Investigation check (DC 15, so he can use passive if he prefers), which reveals the paper drake at the window, and the storm getting stronger.

 - [ ]  **Alton Prescott** (Alex)

- Alton lives alone now, in a large Aundairan town called Lathleer, and the only extended family around is his ex-wife's family.
- Start the scene with him leaving his job as a stone mason/carver, and ask Alex what he does on his way home.
	- **Madame Elise Gibbard** (female human noble). She spots him passing and offers a polite but patronizing nod. “Ah, Mr. Prescott. Have you given thought to tailoring something more fitting? You still wear a laborer’s garb.” If Alton is curt, she’ll sigh, “It’s a shame to see the Prescott name fall into such disrepair.”
	- **Tobin "Toby" Arkwright** (street vendor who sells roasted nuts and sweet rolls near Alton’s usual route home). “Evenin’, Mr. Prescott! Got a fresh batch today — first one’s free for my favorite stone man!” (He thinks Alton is grumpy but still likes him.)
- Note that when Alton arrives home, it's a stately but somewhat cold noble residence, still bearing his wife’s family crest on the gates.
- Alton makes himself dinner (a small already constructed plate, warmed in a small oven - TV dinner style) and settles into a large book about magic. As he's reading. he hears a strange sound at the door. When the door is opened, ask for a Perception check (DC 15). On a failure, he sees nothing, and when he turns around the paper drake is galivanting around his house! On a success, he does hear the paper drake behind him.
- Alton will need to catch the paper drake that's running around his house, requiring a DC 14 Athletics check.

 - [ ]  **Shear** (Trey)

- Open with Shear in his small room above the Moonlit Forge (in the town of Skairn), where he starts his day. When he leaves the room, he is greeted by Brugha (the orc who essentially raised him), who is working at the forge.
- Shear leaves the Moonlit Forge and walks through the Driftwood Market, on his way to the Forsaken Shrine where he often spends his days. Ask Trey if Shear goes anywhere else, or does anything, on his way to the shrine.
- Shear arrives at a dilapidated shine on the border of the Forsaken Forest. This is the Forsaken Shrine, near the place where he was found. When he steps inside, he immediately knows something is amiss (passive Perception of 16), and that his things have been rummaged through by some creature which has since left (passive Insight of 16). Shear will need to track the creature through the Forsaken Forest, by succeeding in a DC 14 Survival check, with failure resulting in the paper drake finding him first.

 - [ ]  **Zsehissu** (Sara)

- Zsehissu is stationed at The Verdant Coil, a clandestine operations hub nestled within Io’vakas, where orders for assassinations and espionage flow like whispers through the jungle-shrouded city. The place is a mixture of refined, austere efficiency and serpentine menace — silken curtains, hushed conversations, and hidden blades.
- Her current task? Paperwork. Officially, she’s on standby. Unofficially, it’s a tedious watch-and-wait game behind a desk, skimming coded documents, sifting through information, and preparing for a job that may never come.
- Ask Sara what she's doing at her desk. After exploring that a bit, she hears something nearby. It seems as though a piece of paper, possibly one of the many important coded documents dotting your desk, has been folded into a form (a dragon?) and is moving around the room. Zsehissu knows that if it's discovered that one of the documents she tends to has gone missing, she'll never get another assignment!
- Overseer Veksha (male yuan-ti assassin), Zsehissu's boss, is a cold, calculating yuan-ti pureblood with golden scales and slit-pupil eyes. She speaks in slow, deliberate tones, as if constantly measuring the weight of every word. Veksha doesn't think highly of wasted motion, and she certainly wouldn't be pleased if Zsehissu left her post for anything less than an assassination.
- Sara will need to come up with a plan to retrieve the document without alerting her boss. This may require a Deception or Intimidation check to talk with her boss can convince him that she needs to be able to leave her desk for some reason so she can covertly investigate the paper. Or it could be a Stealth check to sneak away from her desk without her boss noticing. Either way, success means she is able to get to the paper drake and discover that instead of a secret yuan-ti document, it's her acceptance letter to Strixhaven!
