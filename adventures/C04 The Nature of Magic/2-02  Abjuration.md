### Background and Hook(s)

* An Oriq agent infiltrated Morgrave University, sabotaging the Aegis Matrix to release the Arcane Devourer as part of a larger plan to destabilize Sharn and hasten the collapse of magic in Eberron. The artifact was shattered during the attack, scattering its core components.

### Characters and Locations

* **Professor Korynth Alshain** (male human, Head of Abjuration Studies). A meticulous scholar who helped create the Aegis Matrix, now wracked with guilt over its failure. Despite his reserved demeanor, he’s determined to see it restored.
* **Ryn Stormhold** (non-binary half-orc, Captain of the University Guard). A pragmatic and battle-hardened defender of Morgrave University, skeptical of outsiders. They aid the players with tactical advice and defenses against the Arcane Devourer.
* **Archivist Thariel** (female elf, Keeper of Magical Relics). A nervous but brilliant curator of the Vault of Forgotten Relics, deeply protective of its treasures. She provides cryptic guidance on handling rogue artifacts and hints at Oriq involvement.
* **Arcane Devourer**. A horrifying magical construct that consumes magic, radiating an antimagic field. It was unleashed by the Aegis Matrix’s failure and must be weakened before direct confrontation.

* **Morgrave University, [[Sharn]]**

### Scenes and Situations

###### Morgrave University and the Aegis Matrix
 - [ ] 
- The adventure begins with the players uncovering the Oriq agent’s involvement. Clues point to the agent having deliberately disrupted the Aegis Matrix to release the Arcane Devourer. Key objectives:
	- Examine the site of the sabotage for evidence, such as the agent’s magical signature or notes on their motives.
	- Learn that the Oriq agent has scattered the Matrix’s core components to prevent reassembly.

###### The Keystone of Shielding
 - [ ] 
- The first piece is hidden in the Hall of Arcane Warfare, now overrun by malfunctioning defensive constructs.
- Players must deactivate or bypass the constructs, whose attacks mimic spells like Shield and Counterspell.

###### The Sigil of Warding
 - [ ] 
- The second piece is trapped in the Vault of Forgotten Relics, where magical artifacts have gone haywire due to the failing wards.
- Players face chaotic magical effects and rogue artifacts (e.g., animated spell scrolls or cursed items).

###### The Glyph of Banishment
 - [ ] 
- The final piece is anchored in the Planar Studies Wing, now distorted by a planar rift.
- Players must close the rift while contending with extraplanar creatures, using tools and strategies to simulate abjuration spells like Banishment and Dispel Magic.

###### Reassembling the Aegis Matrix
 - [ ] 
- The components must be reassembled in the Central Ward Nexus, a secure chamber beneath the university. This process involves aligning the components into their proper configuration to restore the artifact’s protective power.
- Probably need some sort of cool puzzle here....

###### Confronting the Arcane Devourer
 - [ ] 
- With the Aegis Matrix restored, the players can weaken the Arcane Devourer. The restored wards disrupt its antimagic aura, allowing the players to fight it directly. Key mechanics:
	- The Matrix projects protective fields, giving the players safe zones where they can prepare attacks or regroup.
	- The Devourer’s abilities escalate as it takes damage, forcing players to stay mobile and adapt.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- **Arcane Devourer** (inspired by Intellect Devourer). A large monster that consumes magic, based on the Arcanaton from Pathfinder (and possibly taking the Antimagic Cone from the Beholder), is rampaging across Morgrave. Possibly with appearance and other traits based on the Eldrazi from MtG.
	- Need to create a custom stat block for this!
