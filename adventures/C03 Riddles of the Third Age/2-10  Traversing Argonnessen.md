### Background and Hook(s)

* The players emerge from the Crystal Library of Azalakardon in Argonnessen, and must traverse the center of the continent in order to get to Arstyvrax and his topaz dragons.
* This is run as a point crawl, with five major points (scenes below) and several minor connections that mostly lead to random encounters. Maybe some of these involve dragons finding out the players, who shouldn't be traipsing across the continent unaccompanied.

### Characters and Locations

* **Valthyrian the Watchful** (male mercury dragon). Valthyrian is an imposing adult mercury dragon with scales that glint like polished metal in the sunlight. His eyes are a deep orange, and they flit around constantly keeping awareness of his surroundings. His wings are broad and powerful, and his sleek and serpentine body ends with a whip-like tail. Valthyrian is known for his vigilance and unwavering sense of duty.
* **Thyrlossia the Veiled** (female iron dragon). Thyrlossia is a graceful adult iron dragon with shimmering scales with silver highlights. Her eyes are a bright silver, almost reflective, and her presence exudes an imposing aura. Her wings are sleek and agile, allowing her to maneuver effortlessly through the skies. Thyrlossia is known for her calm demeanor and her strategic mind. She is a patient observer, preferring to analyze situations thoroughly before taking action. She is compassionate and empathetic, often taking time to understand the needs and concerns of the inhabitants of Vorel’Arux. However, she is also a fierce protector, unyielding when the city’s safety is at stake.
* **Anthissalara the Seer** (female blue dragon). Anthissalara is an imposing ancient blue dragon with scales that shimmer like sapphires. Her eyes are a striking electric blue, glowing with arcane power. Her horns curve elegantly back from her head, and her wings are adorned with intricate patterns that seem to shift and change with her movements. She has a regal bearing, and her presence commands respect and attention. Anthissalara is known for her sharp intellect and her keen insight into the Draconic Prophecy. She is highly analytical and strategic, often seeing patterns and connections that others miss. Despite her formidable power, she prefers to operate from the shadows, using her abilities to observe and manipulate events from afar. She values knowledge and information above all else and is often more interested in the big picture than in individual details.
* **Skribble** (male kobold scholar). A small, wiry kobold with reddish-brown scales and bright, curious eyes. He wears a set of well-worn but meticulously maintained robes adorned with pockets and pouches filled with quills, scrolls, and small magical trinkets. His tail is often seen twitching with excitement, especially when discussing subjects of knowledge and lore. Despite his small stature, he has a commanding presence in the Archives due to his vast knowledge and quick wit.
* **Athis the Scorned** (LE male half-silver dragon ranger). A half-dragon hunter of dragons, who speak with a Jersey accent. In his dozen years with his mother (his father was left to die in the Vast), Athis developed a healthy contempt of dragons. He considers them spoiled, arrogant, and cruel. When his mother evicted him, Athis’s contempt turned to rage. He swore vengeance and dedicated his skills to becoming a champion dragonstalker. Now, almost a decade later, Athis the Scorned is one of the most fearsome creatures in the Vast. He stalks dragons with cunning and premeditation and has killed more than one. So far his mother still lives; Athis continues to hone his skills so that one day he will be able to bring her down without fear of failure. Athis is a loner and cares nothing for the company of nondragons. He is just as likely to target dragon allies as he is dragons themselves; anything to weaken their defenses. As bitter as he is, Athis might even target creatures he sees associating with dragons, without establishing their motives first. A dire bat accompanies Athis on his travels, but poses no threat to an actual dragon. Athis uses the bat to draw dragons into an ambush in chase of what seems like easy prey.
* **Yerod Toothdiver** (male gnoll artificer). A gnoll thunder guide fleeing captivity by a dominion lord (dragon ruler of The Vast). He is a skilled artificer and follower of The Traveler. Could use him to introduce the Topaz Annihilator (which he built after retrieving a topaz dragon scale) if desired.

* **[[Vorel’arux]] (The Tapestry, [[Argonnessen]])**. A 60-foot-tall white stone wall circles Vorel’arux. Dragons fly over the wall with ease, but landbound creatures find it contains no doors or openings of any kind. Dragons of all colors flit about; the sun reflects off their scales, bouncing multicolored patches onto the wall and buildings of Vorel’arux.
* **[[Io'lokar]] (The Vast, [[Argonnessen]])**
* **The Tapestry**
* **The Vast**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **[[Vorel’Arux]]**

* The players emerge from the Library into a long-forgotten storm sewer that runs under the city of Vorel'arux. Ironically, the long lost Crystal Library of Azalakardon was literally under the dragons' feet the whole time! As the last player emerges, the door to the library (a non-descript stone wall-like structure) closes on its own.
* The sewer snakes under the entire city, allowing the players to access all major locations. But it doesn't go outside of the city, and the players will need to navigate the perimeter wall in order to get outside on their own. Players would also need to emerge from the sewer in order to interact with anything they can see from within the sewers (such as the below locations where interesting things are happening, or any of the other locations listed in the location page):
	* **The Fountain**. An Ancient Blue Dragon, Anthissalara the Seer, is scrying on other dragons across Argonnessen using the waters of The Fountain. It should be clear to the players that any location in Argonnessen can be seen from this pool of water. They can also observe from a distance that something is going on at the Pit of Five Sorrows, where topaz dragons can be seen gathering.
	* **Archives**. The sewers end abruptly at a wall similar to the one the party emerged from when leaving the Library. Those observing the wall see a kobold open it up, look around, and return inside. This same event occurs every hour, and the players may interact with the kobold (Skribble) if they choose, even possibly convincing him to let them inside. In that case, he might agree to help the players gather any information they may need. For every hour spent in the Archives, roll a d20 to determine if the patrol dragons check in - with them appearing on a 18+ (and this number decreasing by one for every additional hour spend in the Archives).
* Two dragons patrol the city - Valthyrian the Watchful and Thyrlossia the Veiled. Any time the players exit the sewers, they must roll a group Stealth check against the dragons' Passive Perception scores (22 and 20, respectively). If discovered, the patrolling dragons will warn the players only once, telling them to leave the city immediately. If discovered a second time, the party will be picked up by the dragons and flown out of the city, then dropped just outside of the wall (taking 7d6 bludgeoning damage from the 70 foot fall).

 - [ ]  **Gix'kuhri**

* This river divides Vorel'Arux from The Tapestry, and serves as a barrier for the players. At its narrowest, near Vorel'Arux, the river is `dice:1d8+2` miles across. The players may choose to create a boat of some sort, use magic creatively, or simply try to traverse on foot.
* At the start of this encounter, roll initiative. The challenge should last a number of rounds equal to the number of miles the river is across. At the top of each round, roll on the random encounters table to determine if the players encounter any obstacles (40% chance).
* If trying to cross on foot, the player(s) may make a Survival check to attempt to find a safe location to cross. There is no DC for this check, as its purpose it to set the DC of the crossing Strength check, which is 30 minus the Survival check (so a Survival of 15 would mean a crossing DC of 15). If a character fails this Strength check, they are immediately pulled a number of feet downstream equal to the check's DC. The character makes this check again at the start of each of its turns, getting pulled further downstream each time it fails, and gaining their footing and free movement on a success.

 - [ ]  **The Tapestry**

* For each hour spent traveling across the Tapestry, on a 12+ the PCs see `dice: 1d4` dragons flying above, of various random colors (by rolling on the dragon color table for each dragon present). A successful DC 15 group Stealth check allows them to avoid being seen, otherwise the dragons will approach and question them.
`dice:[[Draconic Factions#^random-dragon-color]]`

 - [ ]  **The Vast**

* Athis the Scorned roams The Vast, looking for opportunities to kill dragons. Could be a great potential ally NPC to introduce to the party.
* For each hour spend here, roll a d20, with Athis showing up on 16+.
* If randomly roaming the vast, ask for a group Survival check. On a 10+, they end up at Io'lokar. On a 5-9, they end up back at The Tapestry. On a 1-4, they end up at the Nestling Plateau.

 - [ ]  **Io'lokar**

* 

 - [ ]  **Nestling Plateau**

- This region is set aside for the youngest members of the Vast. It is essentially a training ground, where newcomers can test their wits against each other before claiming a dominion in the Vast proper. It’s rare to encounter a dragon older than a young adult here. However, if adventurers or other nondragons take advantage of this — slaying too many of the dragons or stealing their rightful prey — it should attract the attention of one of the great wyrms who maintains the Vast.
- As PCs approach, they see `dice:1d6+1` dragon wyrmlings of various random colors, guarded by a young adult dragon of a random color. If they decide to get closer, a DC 18 Stealth check is required to not be seen.
- Getting past this area leads directly to the Pit of Five Sorrows below.

 - [ ]  **The Pit of Five Sorrows and Tiamat's Temple**

* Mass combat against topaz dragons, then the final face-off against Arstyvrax and the Aspect of Tiamat. See [[2-11  Investigating the Dragons]] adventure.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The Pit of Five Sorrows is a chasm in Argonnessen that is the prison for the Overlord Tiamat, the Daughter of Khyber. The pit is one of the deepest chasms in Khyber, and is enclosed in a dome of force and protected by wards to prevent access. At the bottom of the pit is a massive Khyber shard containing Tiamat.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Some challenge(s) here, when the PCs emerge from the Crystal Library at Vorel’arux in the Tapestry. A unique challenge in the Tapestry (where non-dragons would be mostly ignored or treated as pets or pests) as well as The Vast (where there are fewer dragons of more different types, and non-dragons are entirely ignored), as the players traverse Argonnessen to get to the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Use the Talons of Tiamat as a foil to the players while here, possibly secretly hunting them from the shadows.
* There should be some information given out here about the Light of Siberys and their existing work to protect the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Use the Draakhorn from Tyranny of Dragons / Rise of Tiamat (page 169), much as it's presented, as a signaling war horn being utilized by the topaz dragons (and ditching most of the other lore around it). This gives the players the chance to subvert the horn and possibly use it against the dragons.
* Probably run these areas as a point crawl. Possible encounters (more in Dragons of Eberron, page 63):
	* A non-dragon of some sort running away from somewhere. He's fleeing from a dragon master, who was keeping him captive.
	* Someone should try to take their Orb of Dragonkind
	* A dragon who discovers them while traveling. They must explain themselves and why they're here, or get eaten.
* If the group gets lost or off track in the deserts of The Vast or The Light of Siberys, then confront them with a dracosphinx.

	* https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dracosphinx
* Somewhere here (probably in Vorel'Arux), introduce a warlock NPC with the sphinx of wonder patron (or even introduce the patron first). The warlock should probably attack the party, and they will likely kill him. But the patron survives and takes a liking to the party. Then come up with mechanics to make the sphinx more powerful - likely via obtaining information or riddles or something else very sphinx-like.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. |
