### Background and Hook(s)

>The treasures of the lost age of Xen'drik are legendary. The wonders and dangers of Khorvaire are immortalized in story and song. The lore of the mysterious dragons has fixed Argonnessen in the minds of scholars and sages for a thousand years. A world away from the rest of Eberron, Sarlona remains a land of mystery.
>The cradle of humanity, Sarlona is a land whose history and present are steeped in conflict. Around the bonfires of the nomadic Syrks, lost legends of sorcerer-kings and devastating magewars are passed from one generation to the next. Myths of the yuan-ti and the Age of Fiends are whispered among the Keepers of the Word and the Heirs of Ohr Kaluun alike.
>Centuries of the continent's history belonged to the Inspired and the Unity of Riedra, but everything changed one day when the age of Dal Quor turned, killing all of the quori and devastating the government that once held a vice grip on almost the entire population. In the last few decades things have started to settle, but the new Ten Regions of this ancient continent are a far cry from Riedra.
