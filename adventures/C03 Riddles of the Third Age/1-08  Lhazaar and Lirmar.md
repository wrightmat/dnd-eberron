### Background and Hook(s)

* The Map of Sphinx Sightings has a few visible markings indicating sightings in the area.
* 

### Characters and Locations

* **Lirmar** (Hieracosphinx)
* **High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn** (LN male human ranger). The leader of the Lhazaar Principalities, and Commander of the Seadragon Fleet (from his ship the Dragoneye), whose home is in Regalport. High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn is very clever, using his sword and words to get what he needs and wants. His reputation encourages local merchants to ally themselves with him in order to protect their vessels. No other band of pirates dares to raid Regalport. Ryger has allied himself with House Thuranni and gave them some land in Regalport soon after he became a prince. Many rumors spin about this alliance being a leverage against the Gray Tide principality. He wants the Principalities to join together as a true unified nation with a clear hierarchy, but that has not yet been achieved.
* **Baron Elar d'Thuranni** (LN male elf). Patriarch of House Thuranni. Baron Elar always has at his side two greater shadows named Wrem and Wrek. These creatures are as dark as night, and as insubstantial as smoke. They serve as the Baron's bodyguards, as well as his agents during the few important times when the Baron himself goes on an assassination. The Baron has a residence above the Grand Thuranni Theater, and runs the back of house.
* **Viceroy Ureilya d'Thuranni** (female elf). Secret leader of the Dragon's Path, a group dedicated to understanding the draconic prophecy. The Viceroy runs the front of house at the Grand Thuranni Theater when in town, but she travels the continent and lives elsewhere (and refuses to divulge where).
* **Terrance Akrifolous** (male changeling). High Prince Ryger's right hand man, and Commander of the second gem of the Seadragon Fleet, the Dragon's Hoard.
* **Jorik Saltweave** (male human bard). A charismatic and rugged human in his late forties, with a keen eye for both fashion and function, especially when it comes to outfitting the various pirates and sailors who frequent the Pirate Exchange of Regalport. With tanned skin weathered by the sea and hair the color of sun-bleached sand, Jorik embodies the spirit of the sea. His shop, "The Salty Spindle," is an eclectic mix of high-seas fashion and practical maritime gear, catering to a clientele that values both style and durability in their garments.
* **Seraphel d'Thuranni** (female changeling bard). Lead actor at the Grand Thuranni Theater, and Lieutenant of the Order of the Sapphire Scales. As a changeling, Seraphel's natural form is a blank canvas, with pale, almost translucent skin, white hair, and featureless, silver eyes. However, she rarely shows this true form, preferring instead to adopt the guise of a stunning half-elf with deep blue eyes and silver hair, a visage that has become her signature look both on and off the stage. Her ability to shift her appearance at will makes her an unparalleled actor, capable of portraying any role to perfection. Seraphel views life as the ultimate performance, where only those who can truly adapt can master the chaos that shapes the world. Adopted by the d’Thuranni family for her unique talents, Seraphel quickly found her calling on the stage and within the clandestine activities of the Order of the Sapphire Scales. Her changeling nature allowed her to gather secrets and sway influential figures in Regalport and beyond, all while maintaining her persona as the city's most beloved actress.

* **[[Regalport]]**
* **Ninebay Island**
* **Lair of the Swift Guardian**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [x]  **Regalport** (nearby capital city)

This is the capital of the Principalities, with just about any product available that's related to the sea or shipping. It's also one of the few places that's familiar with the details of Sarlona (especially Rhiavhaar). Regalport is a punk rock "ride the lightning" fantasy fusion of New Orleans, Venice and Singapore. "Trapped lightning" is a design concept throughout the city, featuring street lamps with coursing currents of blue electricity (less like lightbulbs, more like Tesla coils) and public statues or tavern signs that cascade streaks of lightning (like neons).

* **High Prince's Estate**. Home of High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn.
* **Pirate Exchange**. This exchange boasts a variety of merchants selling goods from across the continent of Khorvaire, as well as local catches of seafood and treasures found around the islands that make up the Principalities. The exchange is one of the few places that regularly stocks items from Argonnessen and Sarlona.
	* The Salty Spindle.
* **Seadragon Seaport**. The Seadragons are the largest fleet in the Lhazaar Principalities, captained by High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn. They are the strongest of the powers in the Lhazaar Principalities. The Seadragons have twenty ships and many loyal fighters.
* **Grand Thuranni Theater**. Home of Baron Elar d'Thuranni and headquarters of House Thuranni. Both the True Shapers guild (architecture, costuming, painting, pottery, and sculpture) and the Shadow Network (musicians, artists, actors, and all kinds of performers) operate out of the building, with elaborate plays put on as a front for the house's espionage and assassinations. Many changelings serve as staff and extras for the theater.
	* "Shadows Over Cyre" premiered here for the 1051 YK season. See "Optional: Grand Thuranni Theater" scene below.
* **Shrine of the Giver.** Next to the theater is a temple to the giver, where many of the changelings who work in the theater spend their time.
* **Boromar Vineyard and Distillery**. A front business for the Boromar Clan's criminal activities in the area, especially in and around the Pirate Exchange. But they do grow grapes, and produce legitimately good wine and distilled brandy (which is often found on all ships leaving the ports here).
* **House Ghallanda Enclave**.
* **House Kundarak Enclave**.
* **House Orien Enclave**.

 - [x]  **Approaching Ninebay Island**

* Ninebay Island is a large manifest zone to Syrania, which results in strange sudden winds, changes in gravity, and other effects that will impact the PCs. The lair of the sphinx is actually in the clouds above Ninebay Island, where the PCs can eventually arrive if they can survive the challenges.
* The PCs will need to assist the captain in navigating a sudden tumultuous storm that appears on their way to Ninebay Island. The PCs have to succeed on a number of skill checks (5 successes before 3 failures) in order to get through (examples below, but PCs may attempt whatever actions they can justify).
	- Athletics (DC 14): You climb the rigging to secure the sails.
	* Sleight of Hand (DC 10): You find a loose rope, secure it, and tie it off.
	- Strength (DC 14): You see the helm deviate, and use your strength the grab the wheel and force the ship back on course.
	- Investigation (DC 10): You notice ropes before they snap and manage to secure them.
	- Nature (DC 14): Your knowledge of the wind and waves allows you to suggest an alternate course to the captain which might allow him to steer out of the storm.
	- Perception (DC 14): You detect the scent of a fresh wind coming in. Your keen eyes see a break in the storm off in the distance. You recommend that the captain alter course to find calmer seas.
	- Arcana (DC 14): Your knowledge of magic leads you to believe that this storm is artificial in some way. Your analysis allows you to recommend course corrections to the captain.

 - [x]  **Climbing to the Clouds**

* Clouds begin to swirl beneath the players' feet as they walk across the island, and they eventually start to coalesce into small platforms that move them upward. Players must traverse the cloud platforms using DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, as the clouds shift beneath their feet. Three successful checks must be made to reach the next scene.
* Failure may lead to a fall through the clouds, unless a quick reaction is performed to prevent it. Each challenge takes place thirty feet above the last one, determining what the potential fall damage would be if that check is failed (1d6 per 10 feet, with the first being at 30 feet and the last being at 90 feet).
* Check 1: `dice:3d6`, Check 2: `dice:6d6`, Check 3: `dice: 9d6`

 - [x]  **Whirlwind Nexus**

* A central platform is surrounded by swirling vortexes of wind, 100 feet above the ground. Four elemental creatures, each representing a cardinal wind, guard the path forward.
* The steam mephit represents the hot summer south wind (red), the ice represents the cold winter north wind (blue), the dust represents the dry autumn east wind (yellow), and the mud mephit represents the gentle spring west wind (green). When each is defeated, it leaves behind a colored gem that's used later in the adventure.

`encounter: 1: Steam Mephit`
`encounter: 1: Ice Mephit`
`encounter: 1: Dust Mephit`
`encounter: 1: Mud Mephit` (reskinned slightly with more leaves and sticks mixed in so it looks more generally "spring-like")

 - [x]  **Skyward Sentries**

* A series of floating platforms lead to a walled chamber ahead. Aerial sentries, winged constructs with razor-sharp feathers, patrol the area. A DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check is necessary to sneak by the sentries, with any failures resulting in them being alerted to that players' presence.
* At the center of the room, a magical chest awaits (containing the [[Wings of Flying]]). These platforms are 200 feet above the ground.

`encounter: 1: Aerial Sentry`

 - [x]  **The Walled Chamber**

* This chamber is 300 feet above the ground, and houses a solitary figure known as a Cloudweaver (use the Living Cloudkill stat block if necessary). The Cloudweaver is named Amira, glows with a warm, soft, teal blue light, and floats as though weightless or underwater (a calmer, bluer version of Gale Cumulus from Disney's Elemental, so played by Wendi McLendon-Covey). She carries a small key that opens a "door" (a keyhole which opens up a gap in the clouds when the key is turned in it) which is the only exit out of the room.
* If any creature attempts to ascend in the room, then the walls grow upward with them. The intended solution is to steal the key from Amira, requiring a DC 12 Sleight of Hand check, with failure causing Amira to chastise the character and then use her Spell Mimicry ability to fill the room with fog. Any subsequent checks must be made at disadvantage, until the PC has a means to see through or disperse the fog.

 - [x]  **Pedestal of Seasons**

* A column of wind outside the previous doors catches the players and sweeps them up to this platform 400 feet above the ground. In the center of the cloud platform is a pedestal with four gem-sized indentations in each of the four cardinal directions at the top. If the players place the four gems from the Whirlwind Nexus in the correct positions (red at the bottom, blue at the top, yellow to the right, and green to the left) then a platform of cloud they're standing on begins rising upward toward a chamber 200 feet above.

 - [x]  **Chamber of the Swift Guardian**

> As you ascend of a platform of cloud, your heads punch though a cloud above to a brightly glittering new chamber. Crystals embedded in the nearby clouds refract ambient light, casting prismatic hues across the vast space.
> In the center of this chamber, a majestic nest of golden feathers, adorned with radiant gemstones, serves as the regal perch for a creature with the head and wings of a hawk and the body of a lion. The creature spreads its wings, catching and spreading the chamber's iridescent glow, as its amber eyes catch yours, reflecting both wisdom and curiosity.

> "To soar with the grace of the wind is to master one's own destiny. Your dexterity has been tested, and you have been found worthy. I am at your service," the sphinx says, while bowing deeply.

* This chamber is 600 feet above the ground. Lirmar should fill in any lore about the blue dragons, others in the region, or anything the players would like to know about.

 - [ ]  **Optional: The Grand Thuranni Theater**

* [[Theater Plays]]
* Should the PCs return to see the "Shadows Over Cyre" play at the theater, several things should happen to drive forward the blue dragon and Order of the Sapphire Scale plot - the lead actor is revealed as an agent of the Order, and an Eldritch Machine swirling in chaotic magic suddenly appears and disappears just as suddenly with several people (including the lead actor).
* Ureilya is minding the front of house, as usual, and will be present in the foyer when the players arrive, should they like to speak with her prior to the play starting. After a minute or two of real-time for the PCs to explore the theater or chat, the lights flash, indicating that the play is about to start.
* The lead actor in the play is a changeling woman named Seraphel, who portrays the matriarch of the family. She is backstage before the play, but should the PCs seek her out and speak with her, a passive Perception of 12 or greater reveals the blue scale under her costume (which is also revealed during the play below regardless).
* The PC's seats are near the middle of the theater, so they are at no risk of being enveloped by the Infernal Engine, which takes `dice:1d12` audience members from the front two rows, as well as `dice:1d3`actors.
* After the play, Seraphel can be found in the foyer, shaking hands and signing autographs. If the players ask about the Order, she is cryptic and unwilling to reveal information, while also seeming completely unshaken about the events surrounding the Infernal Engine (as if she expected it to happen at some point). Seraphel does know the location of Kalryni, but won't reveal it easily.

* **Scene 1: A Day Like Any Other in Metrol**
>"The stage before you transforms with the bustling life of Metrol's streets, its people moving like clockwork in the illusion of an ordinary day. Laughter mingles with the din of daily chores, a vivid tapestry of life unaware of what looms on the horizon. In the midst of this, the figure of a woman, a noble matriarch, stands out. As she rushes through the crowd, clearly looking for someone, a fleeting moment reveals a blue scale under her attire, catching the light and then vanishing as quickly as it appeared."

* **Scene 2: The Mists Descend**
>"Suddenly, the stage dims, engulfed by illusionary mists that creep and twirl with a life of their own. From the windows of their painted home, a noble family, led by the very same matriarch, watches in horror as the world around them succumbs to an otherworldly gray. The audience is wrapped in a haunting melody, the notes painting each swirl of mist with a touch of despair, encapsulating the moment the world outside was lost."

* **Scene 3: Echoes of Selena**
> "A shift in the set takes you back to a moment frozen in time — the last sighting of the noble matriarch's daughter. She stands at the stage's edge, an image of solitude against the encroaching fog. Her form is swallowed by the mists, leaving behind a silence punctuated only by the echo of her name. Selena. The scene swiftly returns to the present, the family's faces a canvas of unresolved grief and unanswered questions."

* **Climactic Interruption: The Infernal Engine's Arrival**
>"Just as the play reaches its emotional zenith, reality itself seems to fracture. A deafening roar fills the theater, and a monstrous construct erupts onto the stage. It's a chaos of gears and eldritch symbols, its presence warping the air around it. As it spins wildly, it ensnares several actors and audience members in its arcane energy, dragging them into the unknown before vanishing as abruptly as it appeared, leaving behind a wake of confusion and fear."

* **Scene 4: Aftermath in Silence**
>"In the sudden silence that follows, the stage is a scene of disarray, reflective of Cyre's ruins. The lead actor, now in her true changeling form, steps forward. Her words, though meant to conclude the play, speak directly to the heart of the chaos just witnessed. 'In the shadows of Cyre, we find not just loss, but a reminder: the world is ever on the cusp of unfathomable change.' The curtain falls, not with a flourish, but with a solemn, lingering descent."

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [x]  The Order of the Sapphire Scale elves have basically taken control of House Thuranni, with the might of that house now behind the blue dragons.
 - [ ]  Buried deep within the House Thuranni is the Dragon's Path, a group dedicated to understanding the draconic prophecy. Leading the Dragon's Path is Viceroy Ureilya d'Thuranni.
 - [x]  Speartip Island is said to be the location where Lhazaar first made landfall on Khorvaire after she arrived from Sarlona. Blue dragon sightings have drastically increased in the area recently.
 - [ ]  Exiles from the House of Vol landed in the Lhazaar Principalities, specifically Farlnen (which is located on a Mabaran manifest zone), thousands of years ago and created the Bloodsail Principality. Over centuries, they’ve created a society where the living earn an undead afterlife through their deeds in life (different from the Blood of Vol principles that they no longer embrace). Their leaders, the Grim Lords, now rule over that area of the Principalities.
 - [ ]  Prince Kolberkon is the changeling leader of the Diresharks in the Lhazaar Principalities. He governs from Port Verge on the island of Questor. In order to further his plans to to expand and develop Port Verge — to have it rival Regalport and challenge High Prince Rygar ir'Wynarn and the Seadragons — Kolberkon has made alliances between his principality and the Order of the Emerald Claw and House Lyrandar.
 - [ ]  Prince Kel is the changeling leader of the Gray Tide Principality based at Lastpoint island. He established the principality because he wanted a homeland for the changelings that were being hunted down by Karrnath, Cyre, and Thrane. Some say that Lastpoint is the seat of the secret society known as the Cabinet of Faces.
