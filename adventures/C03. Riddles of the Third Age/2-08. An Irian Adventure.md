### Background and Hook(s)

* Irian connects to all of the characters in some way - the Undying Court for Thana, "the light" for Aither, and a possible new home and/or source of radiance for Verity as an Irian aasimar instead of Syranian. They are also already tied to Lorrister, who is an Irian aasimar.
* If the players die (especially a TPK, but could also work with a single death if we split the party for a short time), then they should see a bright light that they're drawn to. If they decide to move toward the light, then they can awake in Irian. If not all of the players die, then the one(s) who do could explore Irian for a short time by themselves, and then could follow shortly with the "Dragon Attack" story beat (see [[Future Adventure Concepts]]), drowning the rest of the characters in the process, where they see a bright white light underwater.

### Characters and Locations

* **[[Dawn Empress]]**
* **Luminael, the Bringer of Dawn**. Luminael is a powerful celestial being and a respected member of the Radiant Court. She embodies the light and renewal that Irian represents and is known for her compassion and wisdom. Luminael is a tall, radiant figure with flowing robes of light and wings that shimmer like the dawn.
* **Prince Lorrister**.

* **Shining Valley, Breland**. A hidden valley in the Graywall Mountains of Breland, it is a strong Irian manifest zone. In the Shining Valley, the surrounding mountains are bathed in light, and even the darker hours are brighter here. The Haunting Song, a harpy flight, has made its home here, for they have refused to submit to the Daughters of Sora Kell.
* **[[Barrakas (Irian)]]**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Optional: Dragon Attack!**

`encounter: 1: Adult Topaz Dragon`

- Start by rolling initiative, with all of the topaz dragons acting on a single initiative (and Arstyvrax only using legendary actions).
	* Round 1: Each topaz dragon breathes their desiccating breath on to the ship. Everyone on the ship must make the Constitution save.
	* Round 2: Each topaz dragon flies over the ship, doing impressive aerial maneuvers (casting *bane*). Everyone on the ship must make the Charisma save. Everyone can also make a DC 15 Perception check (using Thana's passive if no one succeeds), with any successes revealing that Arstyvrax is flying overhead, eying the ship, and heading straight toward it.
	* Round 3: Arstyvrax flies directly over the ship, casting *control water* (Flood), causing a wave to crest over the ship. DC 16 Dexterity save to avoid `dice:4d8` bludgeoning damage.
	* Round 4: Arstyvrax flies back over the ship, casting *control water* (Part Water), causing the water to part directly below him as he flies over. The ship falls to the ocean floor, and the water washes back over it as the spell ends. 
	* The ship is destroyed, and the players land in the water. Start by having each of them roll 2d20 (staying in initiative order), using these rolls to place their mini on the grid, with the first one being on the long axis and the second one on the short axis (for the long axis, which is 22 squares long, ignore the last one on each end; for the short axis, which is 16 squares long, have 2 and 19 be just outside the grid while a 20 lets them pick their location and a 1 starts them as far away from other players as possible).
	* After the first round underwater (6th round overall), each player makes an Investigation check, finding the following things depending on the result: DC 10, they see a bright white light underwater; for every 2 above 10, they find a crew member of the Celeste Noir (in this order: Demetrius d’Lyrandar, Benjamin "Doc Oc" Octavius, Natsuko Hayashi, Oliver Ramorell, Brunhilde Kheldeburn, Aubrey Galatea).
		* Players can hold your breath for 1 + Con modifier minutes (minimum 30 seconds).
		- After that, players stay conscious for Con modifier rounds (minimum 1 round).
		- After that, players drop to 0 hp and start making death saves. They can't regain HP until they get air.
		- Each Action, Reaction, and Bonus Action underwater costs 1 round (6 seconds) of breath.
		* Water is considered difficult terrain without a swim speed, so each foot swam costs one additional foot of movement.
		* Swimming (without a swim speed) or doing anything else of exertion in the rough water requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Failure results in 30 seconds of air being lost instead of 1 round, as they struggle and flounder in the water.
		* Each round that a player speaks or attempts to cast a spell with verbal components removes 30 seconds from the time they can hold their breath.
		* A creature who is holding their breath when they take damage from any source makes a Constitution saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken from the attack, whichever is higher. On a failure, they exhale and run out of breath. It can then survive a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.
- Any players moving into the light find themselves waking up in the Amaranthine City (stick with the whole group or change scenes, depending on what's most appropriate and dramatic). Any players dying find themselves in an appropriate setting related to their past, with a woman dressed all in black (Death) - she explains that it's not yet their time, and opens up a glowing white portal, allowing them to enter Irian instead of Dolurrh.

 - [ ]  **Optional: Shining Valley**

- If we need a way to get the players to Irian that doesn't involve death, could find a way to direct them to Shining Valley. Possibly Verity senses their siblings' presence on the material plane somehow.
- After rebelling against their father (inspired by Verity), they've been exiled from Syrania as Radiant Idols, and sent to Sharn. They quickly left to explore the area and happened upon Shining Valley in Breland. There they allied with The Haunting Song, who they identified with because they were also considered monsters and didn't believe themselves to be so.

 - [ ]  **Amaranthine City**

- The players land in the Amaranthine City and are able to navigate the city if they choose.
- Right as they come to, Aither notices that Snips is not in her pocket! If she looks around, she sees a small mouse-like creature in a hooded cloak holding two knives, looking around as if he's familiar with the place. If conversed with, he's completely shocked that everyone here can see his true form! This is Snips, and the magic of Irian has forced his *disguise self* spell that he always has going to drop, unbeknownst to him. From this point on, Snips can act as a true companion for Aither!
- Soon after they get there, after they've had the chance to do what they like, the Dawn Empress appears and approaches them. She recognizes where they're from and asks for their help with a vital mission - to complete the planar seed for Shae Mordai and return it to Eberron.
- The area around the city is divided into quarters:
	- One area shows signs of civilization and leads to the other areas of Irian (Rhea’s Resort, The Garden, The Refuge, Planar Seeds).
	- One area is forests and meadows full of shrines that leads to Pyrine via a wild zone.
	- One area is plains and deserts dotted with ruins that leads to Khalesh via a wild zone.
	- One area is a true manifest zone that leads to a valley between huge mountains (Shining Valley).
	- The other side of the wild zones have intense sunlight and illusory landscapes of crystal fields and sand.

 - [ ]  **Planar Seed of Shae Mordai**

- Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they’re small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they’re to become.  Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.
- Once the planar seed has been found, the players will need to navigate a number of challenges.
	- First, they must protect the seed from threats while it finishes it maturation. The Dawn Empress explains that the extreme radiant energy of the maturing seed draw creatures from surrounding areas of Irian and drives them into a frenzy, so they'll need to be pacified lest they damage the seed.
	- Second, they must convince the council in charge of determining planar seed readiness, the Radiant Court, to release the planar seed to the material plane.
	- Finally, they must complete a ritual in order to actually send to planar seed to Eberron.

 - [ ]  **Guardians of Light**

- Encounters with wild creatures of light (e.g., radiant beasts or luminous flora). These creatures are attracted to the seed center (a bright tree of light) and must be pacified or driven away. Combat encounters should focus on subduing rather than killing.
- The party may choose to create wards that protect the seed center from disturbances (appropriate spell or DC 15 Arcana check). Any attacks from the wild creatures that hit the seed center result in radiant energy emanating from it, causing all PCs to take `dice:1d12` radiant damage.
- Once the combat with the equinal guardinal (who should act more horse-like and remain on all fours unless attacking) is over, then the horse looks up at Thana in a loving manner, and starts to nuzzle her. Thana is immediately reminded of the great Aerenal steeds that the Deathguard and Undying Soldiers would ride at Shae Mordai in her youth, and feels a connection with this animal. From this point on, this steed can act as a true companion for Thana!

`encounter: 3: Crystal Dragon Wyrmling`
`encounter: 2: Aartuk Elder`
`encounter: 1: Equinal Guardinal`

 - [ ]  **The Radiant Court**

- The characters must present their case to the Radiant Court, a powerful assembly of Irian's celestial beings, to gain their blessing and power to restore the planar seed.
- The party must make Charisma (Persuasion) or Wisdom (Insight) checks (DC 18) to present their case convincingly. Failure results in additional trials or tasks set by the Court.
- During the party's interactions with the Radiant Court, Luminael recognizes Verity's struggle and potential. She offers Verity a chance to undergo the Trial of Radiant Rebirth, a sacred rite that can transform her connection from Syrania to Irian (see below).

 - [ ]  **Ritual of Return**

- Perform a final ritual to harmonize the planar energies and send the seed to its final home in Eberron.
- This involves contribution of a piece of the former version of the seed (so something from the old Shae Mordai) as well as a series of three DC 15 Religion or Arcana checks while chanting an incantation. Thana should come up with something that she contributes from her former home.
- Once the piece of the former seed is placed in a floating ball of light in the center of the new seed, the darkness that has taken over the former Shae Mordai coalesces into a Void Knight and attacks the players. At least one player must maintain chanting at all times during the combat until the three successful checks are made. If a chanting player is hit, they must make a concentration check to maintain their chanting. Any lapse in chanting resets the required checks. Completing the ritual kills the Void Knight in the process.

`encounter: 1: Void Knight`

 - [ ]  **Shae Mordai Restored**

- The players step through a large glowing rift into a newly restored Shae Mordai!
- This process created a manifest zone between Irian and Shae Mordai (probably temporary, but allows movement between the two).

 - [ ]  **Optional: The Trial of Radiant Rebirth**

- During the party's interactions with the Radiant Court, Luminael recognizes Verity's struggle and potential. She offers Verity a chance to undergo the Trial of Radiant Rebirth, a sacred rite that can transform her connection from Syrania to Irian. The ritual consists of the following steps:
	- **Acceptance**. Luminael explains the trial and its significance. Petitioners must choose to accept this trial willingly. This can involve a Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 15) to understand the full implications.
	- **Cleansing Light**. Petitioners must step into a pool of pure light. They must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) to withstand the intense radiant energy without harm. Success means being cleansed of any past planar ties.
	- **Embracing the Radiance**. Petitioners must meditate and open themselves to Irian's light. This involves a Charisma check (DC 18) to show genuine desire to connect with Irian.
	- **Rebirth**. Luminael performs a ritual that channels Irian's energy into Verity, transforming her essence. This involves making a final Charisma saving throw (DC 18) to fully integrate Irian's light.
- **Success**. Verity transforms into an Irian aasimar, gaining abilities and a connection reflective of Irian's radiant nature. Her appearance may change subtly to reflect her new origin, such as a constant soft glow or eyes that shine with a gentle light.
- **Failure**. For each check failed, Verity takes one level of exhaustion.
- After going through the ritual, a beautiful white and gold owl flies up to them. This is a radiant owl that's native to Irian, and Luminael can explain that it appears to have bonded to them since they went through the ritual. From this point on, the owl can serve as a true companion for Verity!

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The gold dragons are associated with Irian.
 - [ ]  The only known manifest zone to Irian is the Shining Valley in Breland.
 - [ ]  Wild zones to Irian exist in Pyrine and Khalesh in Sarlona.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Each PC should have the opportunity to befriend an animal companion here. These should use the "Primal Companion" optional rules from Tasha's Beast Master Ranger, and primarily serve to help with players with advantage or small attacks. But if used in battle, they can get attacked and possibly die! Create NPC cards for each with full stat blocks (finalized after they're received so the name can be included).

> [!info]+ Companions (based on Primal Companion from Tasha's - Ranger: Beast Master Conclave)
You can magically summon a radiant companion, which draws strength from its bond with you. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands.
In combat, the companion acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the companion to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
If your companion dies, such as while in battle, it disappears into a radiant ball of light, returning to Irian. Once per long rest, you can use an action to return your companion to life on the material plane, with all of its hit points restored.
