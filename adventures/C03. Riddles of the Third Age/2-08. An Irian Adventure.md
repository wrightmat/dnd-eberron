### Background and Hook(s)

* Irian connects to all of the characters in some way - the Undying Court for Thana, "the light" for Aither, and a possible new home and/or source of radiance for Verity as an Irian aasimar instead of Syranian. They are also already tied to Lorrister, who is an Irian aasimar.
* If the players die (especially a TPK, but could also work with a single death if we split the party for a short time), then they should see a bright light that they're drawn to. If they decide to move toward the light, then they can awake in Irian. If not all of the players die, then the one(s) who do could explore Irian for a short time by themselves, and then could follow shortly with the "Dragon Attack" story beat (see [[Future Adventure Concepts]]), drowning the rest of the characters in the process, where they see a bright white light underwater.

### Characters and Locations

* **[[Dawn Empress]]**
* **Luminael, the Bringer of Dawn**. Luminael is a powerful celestial being and a respected member of the Radiant Court. She embodies the light and renewal that Irian represents and is known for her compassion and wisdom. Luminael is a tall, radiant figure with flowing robes of light and wings that shimmer like the dawn.
* **Prince Lorrister**.
* **Joy**.
* **Honor**.

* **Shining Valley, Breland**. A hidden valley in the Graywall Mountains of Breland, it is a strong Irian manifest zone. In the Shining Valley, the surrounding mountains are bathed in light, and even the darker hours are brighter here. The Haunting Song, a harpy flight, has made its home here, for they have refused to submit to the Daughters of Sora Kell.
* **[[Barrakas (Irian)]]**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Optional: Shining Valley**

- If we need a way to get the players to Irian that doesn't involve death, could find a way to direct them to Shining Valley. Possibly Verity senses their siblings' presence on the material plane somehow.
- After rebelling against their father (inspired by Verity), they've been exiled from Syrania as Radiant Idols, and sent to Sharn. They quickly left to explore the area and happened upon Shining Valley in Breland. There they allied with The Haunting Song, who they identified with because they were also considered monsters and didn't believe themselves to be so.

 - [ ]  **Amaranthine City**

- The players land in the Amaranthine City and are able to navigate the city if they choose. Soon after they get there, after they've had the chance to do what they like, the Dawn Empress appears and approaches them. She recognizes where they're from and asks for their help with a vital mission - to complete the planar seed for Shae Mordai and return it to Eberron.

 - [ ]  **Planar Seed of Shae Mordai**

- Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they’re small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they’re to become.  Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.
- Once the planar seed has been found, the players will need to navigate a number of challenges.
	- First, they must protect the seed from threats while it finishes it maturation. The Dawn Empress explains that the extreme radiant energy of the maturing seed draw creatures from surrounding areas of Irian and drives them into a frenzy, so they'll need to be pacified lest they damage the seed.
	- Second, they must convince the council in charge of determining planar seed readiness, the Radiant Court, to release the planar seed to the material plane.
	- Finally, they must complete a ritual in order to actually send to planar seed to Eberron.

 - [ ]  **Guardians of Light**

- Encounters with wild creatures of light (e.g., radiant beasts or luminous flora). These creatures are attracted to the seed and must be pacified or driven away. Combat encounters should focus on subduing rather than killing.
- The party may choose to create wards that protect the seed from disturbances (appropriate spell or DC 15 Arcana check). Failure results in minor disturbances, such as radiant storms or magical anomalies.
- Once the combat with the equinal guardinal (who should act more horse-like and remain on all fours unless attacking) is over, then the horse looks up at Thana in a loving manner, and starts to nuzzle her. Thana is immediately reminded of the great Aerenal steeds that the Deathguard and Undying Soldiers would ride at Shae Mordai in her youth.

`encounter: 3: Crystal Dragon Wyrmling`
`encounter: 2: Aartuk Elder`
`encounter: 1: Equinal Guardinal`

 - [ ]  **The Radiant Court**

- The characters must present their case to the Radiant Court, a powerful assembly of Irian's celestial beings, to gain their blessing and power to restore the planar seed.
- The party must make Charisma (Persuasion) or Wisdom (Insight) checks (DC 18) to present their case convincingly. Failure results in additional trials or tasks set by the Court.

 - [ ]  **Ritual of Return**

- Perform a final ritual to harmonize the planar energies and send the seed to its final home in Eberron.
- This involves contribution of a piece of the former version of the seed (so something from the old Shae Mordai) as well as a DC 15 Religion or Arcana check. Thana should come up with something that she contributes from her former home.

 - [ ]  **Shae Mordai Restored**

- The players step through a large glowing rift into a newly restored Shae Mordai!

 - [ ]  **Optional: The Trial of Radiant Rebirth**

- During the party's interactions with the Radiant Court, Luminael recognizes Verity's struggle and potential. She offers Verity a chance to undergo the Trial of Radiant Rebirth, a sacred rite that can transform her connection from Syrania to Irian. The ritual consists of the following steps:
	- **Acceptance**. Luminael explains the trial and its significance. Petitioners must choose to accept this trial willingly. This can involve a Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 15) to understand the full implications.
	- **Cleansing Light**. Petitioners must step into a pool of pure light. They must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) to withstand the intense radiant energy without harm. Success means being cleansed of any past planar ties.
	- **Embracing the Radiance**. Petitioners must meditate and open themselves to Irian's light. This involves a Charisma check (DC 18) to show genuine desire to connect with Irian.
	- **Rebirth**. Luminael performs a ritual that channels Irian's energy into Verity, transforming her essence. This involves making a final Charisma saving throw (DC 18) to fully integrate Irian's light.
- **Success**. Verity transforms into an Irian aasimar, gaining abilities and a connection reflective of Irian's radiant nature. Her appearance may change subtly to reflect her new origin, such as a constant soft glow or eyes that shine with a gentle light.
- **Failure**. For each check failed, Verity takes one level of exhaustion.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The gold dragons are associated with Irian.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- Each PC should have the opportunity to befriend an animal companion here. These should use the "Primal Companion" optional rules from Tasha's Beast Master Ranger, and primarily serve to help with players with advantage or small attacks. But if used in battle, they can get attacked and possibly die! Create NPC cards for each with full stat blocks (finalized after they're received so the name can be included).
	- Aither discovers a fully humanoid Snips, who is actually a Musteval Guardinal native to Irian. This reinforces her connection to "the light", which is sourced from Irian. Snips' *disguise self* drops (without his knowledge, just by nature of being on this plane) and he can speak and serve as their guide.
		- Musteval Guardinal stat block, mostly unmodified (except remove Multiattack).
	- After restoring Shae Mordai, a small horse-like creature approaches Thana. This is a ki-rin runt from Rhea's Resort who never fully developed (unable to fly, small horn, and less magical ability) and has been following the party since they got here, intrigued by them. It bonds with Thana, who is reminded of the great Aerenal steeds that the Deathguard and Undying Soldiers would ride at Shae Mordai in her youth.
		- Ki-rin stat block (spellcasting removed) blended with Valenar Steed stat block, with HP and other stats to the level of Snips.
	- After going through the Radiant Rebirth, Verity is given a companion by Luminael - a radiant owl that's native to Irian.
		- Giant owl stat block? Will definitely need to buff at least HP to get to the same level as Snips.
