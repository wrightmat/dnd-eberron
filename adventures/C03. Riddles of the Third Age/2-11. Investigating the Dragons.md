#### Gold Dragon Chase

- Run as a modified Skill Challenge, with the first to three successes (highest roll on the hazards below) keeping the Heart. Five phases to each round:
	- Hazard occurs
	- Move: choose which station to occupy.
	- Action: Choose Skill to overcome the hazard.
	- Roll: Airship crew and dragon both roll to determine who overcomes the hazard.
	- Dragon Legendary Action
- **Stations**. By default, each station has a crew member with a +2 to their Skill roll. If only the crewmember is there, rolls are at disadvantage. If two are there (NPC and player) then roll is flat, and the player adds their modifier instead of the NPC. If three are there (NPC and two players) then roll is at advantage, and the player with the highest modifier adds theirs. Have a map with each of the six stations on the ship, with a mini for each of the crew NPCs in place. Allow players to move their own minis to wherever they would like to go.
	- **1. Logistics** (STR). Moving supplies from one place to another (jettisoning, battening, resupplying, etc).
		- NPC: Oliver Ramorell (Quartermaster)
	- **2. Ballistics** (DEX). Shooting things!
		- NPC: ??? (PCs decide, because their gunner drowned to death!)
	- **3. Engineering** (CON). Vertical movement, and increasing or decreasing ship's engine power.
		- NPC: ??? (PCs decide)
	- **4. Piloting** (INT). Horizontal movement, and any complex maneuvers.
		- NPC: Demetrius d'Lyrandar
	- **5. Spotting** (WIS). Spotting danger, as well as observing anything that may be going on with the ship.
		- NPC: Natsuko Hayashi
	- **6. Leadership** (CHA). Addressing or commanding the crew, and anything to do with morale.
		- NPC: Aubrey Galatea
- **Hazards**. Each of the hazards below occurs in sequence, designed to simulate the environment the players would be flying over through the course of the chase as the dragons flies toward Argonnessen. The players choose the skill to overcome the challenge, and then both the players and the dragon roll.
	- **Mists**. The dragon's flight path dips into the dead-grey mists of the Mournland. The PCs will need to determine how they maintain visibility in order to keep trailing the dragon.
	- **Kraken**. Over Kraken Bay, the dragon's flight path descends near the water, and gargantuan tentacles reach out of the water and try to grab at anything they can! +17 to hit.
	- **Mountains**. Over Aerenal, the dragon's flight path leads right between two large mountain peaks. The PCs will need to maintain the ship's path without crashing.
	- **Stormy Seas**. Over the Thunder Sea, a sudden storm kicks up and lightning begins to strike!
	- **Barbarians**. Over Seren Island, barbarians on the beach start shooting large crossbows into the sky.
- **Dragon**. The dragon performs a Legendary Action at the end of each round, targeted to a station based on a d6 roll. These actions may disable crew members, stations, or even the entire ship. The Legendary Actions below are performed in order.
	- **Fire Breath**. The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:12d10` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	- **Hezcalipa's Heart**. The dragon brandishes the Heart, which pulses with a radiant energy. Each creature must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:10d8` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	- **Weakening Breath**. The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	- **Wing Attack**. The dragon beats its wings. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6 + 8` bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
	- **Sleep**. Each creature must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell’s effect. The dragon can establish telepathic contact with any sleeping creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.

`encounter: 1: Adult Gold Dragon`

#### Green Dragons & Eldeen Reaches

- The party was told that Empress Corrine could be found in Fairhaven, Aundair (Royal Court of Fairhold).
- The green dragons believe in the direct, unbridled release of Tiamat, envisioning a world where dragons rule with absolute authority. To prepare for this future, they support Corrine’s ambitions in Khorvaire, planning to use her as a means of securing territory and establishing draconic rule over the continent.
- The green dragons view the golds as overly cautious and arrogant, unwilling to share the benefits of Tiamat’s power with those “below” them. They see the golds’ attempts to control Tiamat as hubris and believe that true dragons should embrace her power openly and without restraint.
- The green dragons think their way of freeing Tiamat is more aligned with her primal, unrestrained nature. They aim to prove that they are her most loyal and deserving agents, willing to risk open conflict to establish her reign on Khorvaire.

#### Brass Dragons & Zilargo

* Complex social encounter(s) in which the players have the opportunity to take down the mob that the brass dragons have begun forming. The scenes below can take place in any of the three major cities, depending on where the players decide to go (although ideally Trolanport).
* **Mechanics**:
	* **Resolve**. Every character involved in a social encounter uses a special "social HP" known as Resolve. This is derived from the formula: Int mod + Wis mod + Cha mod + Proficiency Bonus. For NPCs that don't have a full stat block, half of their Social DC (see below) can be used instead. At half Resolve, the character will be open to compromise - they may give what is wanted, but demand something in return. At zero Resolve, the character acquiesces or withdraws from the scene, granting whatever has been asked.
	* **Social DC**. Each NPC has a Social DC that is used for all checks against them. This is simply their highest mental ability score.
	* **Social Style**. An NPC's highest mental ability score also determines their social style. For example, NPCs with high Intelligence are logical and persuasive and focus on the use of facts, while high Wisdom NPCs are observant and rely on appeals to emotion, and high Charisma NPCs are forceful and socially capable.
	* **Desires, Fears, and Secrets**. Every character involved in a social encounter has a desire and fear that drives them. Some may even have secrets they wish to protect. If discovered, this information will make arguments against them more effective, granting advantage to rolls. For PCs, desires and fears can be derives from ideals, bonds, flaws, or background. For NPCs, secrets are an excellent way to allow PCs leverage against the character while also relaying critical information ("Secrets and Clues").
	* **Physical Combat**. If an NPC has a physical ability score as their highest (larger than any of their mental ability scores used above), they may choose to fight instead of compromise. At half Resolve, roll 2d20 (disadvantage) - if both are **under** the character's largest physical ability score, then they choose to attack (instead of compromise) and combat begins. PCs may also choose to initiate physical combat at any time, but doing so will prevent social encounter with that character in the near future.
	* **Round Structure**. There's no initiative while in a social encounter. Only PCs take turns and they can be done in any order. Once everyone who wants to has gone, a new round starts. Any of the below actions can be taken during a round:
		* **Social Skills**. A PC narrates how their character uses any skill of their choice to advance the social scene. Obvious Charisma skills; Insight to determine desire/fear/secret (one per successful check); Perception/Investigation to read the room or possibly find clues to secrets; Intelligence checks (primarily History) to gain context on a situation; etc. The DC for any check is the Social DC for the opposing character outlined above. Success deals one damage to the opposing character's Resolve, with each +5 above the target DC dealing an additional damage (and a critical success automatically dealing 3 damage). Failure deals similar damage to the PC (with each -5 being an extra damage, and a critical failure dealing 3 damage).
		* **Help**. A PC narrates how they help out a friend, granting them advantage on the roll. Both of the characters take the same amount of damage in the case of a failure.
		* **Use Ability or Spell**. A player can use an ability or spell. It affects the scene as the ability or spell would dictate. Be careful though: open aggression or spellcasting may end the encounter entirely or transform it into combat.
		* **Make a Compromise**. If the adversary is at less than half of their Resolve, a player may use their action to make a compromise. The adversary NPC will give you what you want, but first demand something from you in return as an extra cost or in order for you to prove you're serious. If you decide not to take the compromise they offer, take 1 Resolve damage.
		* N.B.: These moves are all for players - notice the NPCs don't actually get any turns. They simply react to the checks of the players, and players are dealt resolve damage in response to poor rolls.

 - [ ]  **1. “The Introduction”**

- **Setting**. A dimly lit jazz club, where the Brass Bards are performing. The air is thick with smoke and quiet murmurs.
- **Objective**. Gather intel on the Brass Bards' leaders and plans.
- **Description**. The players slip into the club as "just another audience." At the center of the stage is the Brass Bards' charismatic leader, Rannik Aeris (male brass dragon disguised as a dwarf), a brass dragon known for his sharp wit and sharper claws. Between songs, he converses with his associates — a half-elven politician and a gnome merchant — each holding drinks and sharing laughs that mask sinister whispers.
- **Complication**. A Trust agent arrives, suspicious of the unusual crowd. The players must divert attention or risk exposure.

* **Rannik Aeris** (male brass dragon disguised as a dwarf). Leader of the Brass Bards. As a skilled orator and performer, his silver tongue has garnered widespread popularity, winning over crowds with every performance. Rannik carries himself with confidence and flamboyance, favoring rich, golden-hued robes that catch the light. He commands attention with his booming laughter and enjoys playful banter, often using humor to deflect suspicion. However, his humor and charisma mask a ruthless streak, especially when it comes to advancing the Brass Bards' ambitions in Zilargo. He's particularly adept at reading crowds and influencing emotions, making him the face of the organization.
	* Strength: 12, Dexterity: 16, Constitution: 13, Intelligence: 10, Wisdom: 12, Charisma: 18, Resolve: 10, Social DC: 18
	* **Desire**: Praise. Craves the adoration and loyalty of the people of Zilargo. Beyond just influence, he wants to be a celebrated hero in their eyes.
	* **Fear**: Manipulation. That he’s merely a pawn in a larger game played by the dragons. Dreads the idea that, despite his accomplishments, he might be replaced or used by those more powerful than him.
* **Vashel Tormire** (male half-elf politician). Vashel is a shrewd, calculating half-elf politician with a keen intellect and a knack for strategy. He often dresses in understated, tailored suits in muted shades, blending seamlessly into any political gathering. Known for his quick mind and impeccable memory, he excels in crafting elaborate plans and tracking every possible outcome. Vashel joined the Brass Bards after Rannik convinced him it was the only way to bring "real change" to Zilargo. He often acts as the group’s planner, advising on political moves and scouting for potential allies — or weaknesses — in the local government.
	* Strength: 9, Dexterity: 12, Constitution: 10, Intelligence: 17, Wisdom: 13, Charisma: 14, Resolve: 10, Social DC: 17
	* **Desire**: Validation. Envisions himself as a true architect of Zilargo’s future, someone who can bring order through precise planning and political maneuvering.
	* **Fear**: Irrelevance. He worries that if the Brass Bards succeed, he’ll be sidelined or reduced to a mere figurehead, overshadowed by Rannik’s charisma.
* **Nimira Finewhistle** (female gnome merchant). Nimira is a small but formidable gnome merchant with an uncanny intuition and a knack for reading people’s intentions. Her curly silver hair is always pulled back with simple, practical hairpins, and she has sharp brown eyes that peer over the rims of thin spectacles. She dresses in earthy colors, with pouches and trinkets hanging from her belt, giving her the appearance of an unassuming trader. Nimira has spent decades navigating Zilargo's trade routes and cultivating contacts within The Trust, allowing her access to underground information channels. She is soft-spoken but deliberate, preferring to listen and observe rather than speak. Her wisdom and insight make her an excellent judge of character, and she often provides moral and strategic counsel, ensuring the Brass Bards stay one step ahead of their enemies.
	* Strength: 8, Dexterity: 14, Constitution: 11, Intelligence: 14, Wisdom: 16, Charisma: 12, Resolve: 9, Social DC: 16
	* **Desire**: Freeing Zilargo from the grip of The Trust, seeing it as the ultimate triumph of her career as a merchant and spy. For her, dismantling The Trust isn’t just about power; it’s about proving that no one is untouchable, not even the most shadowy and feared organization in Zilargo.
	* **Fear**. Betrayal. Having dedicated her life to secrets and manipulation, she knows the price of trust and fears that one day her allies might turn on her.

 - [ ]  **2. “The Shipment”**

- **Setting**. Docks, under a moonlit sky.
- **Objective**. Sabotage a shipment of enchanted instruments meant to sway public opinion.
- **Description**. The players learn that a cargo of enchanted instruments bound for other major Zilargo cities is loaded with charms that influence listeners toward loyalty to the Brass Bards. Under the cover of night, the players make their way to the docks, facing an array of guards, including Brass Bards members with bardic magic.
- **Challenges**. Stealth or Deception to avoid guard patrols and get close to the shipment. Arcana Check to identify and safely disable the magical charms embedded in the instruments. A failed check may cause a cacophonous noise, drawing the guards' attention.

`encounter: 1: Young Brass Dragon, 3: Brass Dragon Wyrmling`

 - [ ]  **3: “The Meeting”**

- **Setting**. A secluded cafe, where several Brass Bards leaders are meeting.
- **Objective**. Disrupt a clandestine meeting between Brass Bards’ leaders and a potential ally from Zilargo’s government.
- **Description**. With the intel they’ve gathered, the players intercept a meeting arranged to sway a key government official toward supporting the Brass Bards’ influence (Minister Chorum). The players’ goal is likely to prevent this alliance through any means necessary.
- **Complication**. A Brass Bard leader catches on to their ruse and triggers an alarm, forcing the players to escape while being chased through the city’s winding alleyways.

- **Minister Falandra Chorum** (female gnome). Falandra is a small, shrewd-looking gnome with short, silvery hair and piercing gray eyes. She has a refined style, wearing intricately embroidered robes in deep burgundy and navy hues that signify her status in Zilargo’s government. Her thin-rimmed spectacles rest low on her nose, and she occasionally peers over them with an appraising look that can be both unsettling and calculated. Known for her sharp wit and diplomatic finesse, Falandra has risen through the ranks due to her knack for navigating Zilargo’s intricate web of political alliances and rivalries. She is ambitious but cautious, always weighing potential risks against the benefits of an alliance. Falandra has earned a reputation for being pragmatic and is rumored to have had dealings with both sides of the law, willing to collaborate with whoever can advance her position.

 - [ ]  **4: “The Grand Finale”**

- **Setting**. A grand celebration and pre-election rally, with the Brass Bards performing as a triumphant finale.
- **Objective**. Publicly expose the Brass Bards’ plot and thwart their influence in Zilargo.
- **Description**. During a city-wide festival, the Brass Bards prepare for a charismatic, city-rallying speech. The players need to reveal the dragons’ plot publicly to turn the city against them. As they act, tension rises between the Brass Bards and a mix of gnome officials, spies, and citizens.
- **Complication**. If the enchanted instruments weren't dealt with earlier, then they are used here to sway everyone gathered here into supporting the Brass Bards.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The Brass Bards are planning to ship out enchanted instruments to the other major cities of Zilargo in order to influence the population toward loyalty to their group.
 - [ ]  Vashel alludes to an upcoming meeting with a Zilargo government official in Zolanberg. He hints that this official is “close to seeing things our way” and could be the key to their future influence in the Triumvirate.
 - [x]  In theory the cities' representative to the Triumvirate is democratically selected from amongst the Council of Nine's members. In practice, the process is anything but democratic, as secret wars of words and blackmail determine power within each council.
 - [x]  The traditional pre-election rally will be held tomorrow evening, and the Brass Bards have been selected as the entertainment.
 - [ ]  Anyone may complain about the increasing surveillance from The Trust, implying that some of their members suspect the Brass Bards of subversive activities. They express frustration over having to conduct their operations “right under The Trust’s nose,” hinting that Trust agents might already be watching them.
 - [ ]  Rannik, after a few drinks, hints at wanting to go beyond Zilargo — implying that Zilargo is only a stepping stone in a much larger plan for him and his allies, one that could lead to influence over the dragonmarked houses or even the Five Nations.
 - [ ]  Someone speculates that recent "accidents" plaguing their allies' establishments may be sabotage by The Trust. They suspect that their agents may be tampering with goods and meetings in retaliation, and it’s rumored that The Trust is desperate to stop the Brass Bards from expanding further.
 - [ ]  The Brass Bards have been sent by dragon elders, and specifically Meretsega, to gather “vital intelligence” and sow discord among the gnomes, with the ultimate goal of infiltrating Zilargo’s Triumvirate. Their mission is not purely self-motivated; it’s part of a larger draconic strategy.
 - [ ]  A brush with the Lords of Dust many years ago left Meretsega crippled and near death. She lives now in a paranoid state, believing the rakshasa lords will overwhelm Argonnessen any day. Having fled to Khorvaire, she set herself up in a lair surrounded by deadly traps and guarded by dominated or intimidated servants.
