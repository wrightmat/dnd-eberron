 - [ ]  **Gold Dragon Chase**

- Modified Skill Challenge, with the first to three successes keeping the Heart.
- Five phases to each round:
	- Move: choose which station to occupy.
	- Hazard occurs
	- Action: Choose Skill to overcome the hazard.
	- Roll: Airship crew and dragon both roll to determine who overcomes the hazard.
	- Dragon Legendary Action
- **Stations**. By default, each station has a crew member with a +2 to their Skill roll. If only the crewmember is there, rolls are at disadvantage. If two are there (NPC and player) then roll is flat, and the player adds their modifier instead of the NPC. If three are there (NPC and two players) then roll is at advantage, and the player with the highest modifier adds theirs. Have a map with each of the six stations on the ship, with a mini for each of the crew NPCs in place. Allow players to move their own minis to wherever they would like to go.
	- **Logistics** (STR). Moving supplies from one place to another (jettisoning, battening, resupplying, etc).
		- NPC: Oliver Ramorell (Quartermaster)
	- Ballistics (DEX). Shooting things!
		- NPC: none
	- Engineering (CON). Vertical movement, and increasing or decreasing ship's engine power.
		- NPC: Prince Lorrister
	- Piloting (INT). Horizontal movement, and any complex maneuvers.
		- NPC: Demetrius d'Lyrandar
	- Spotting (WIS). Spotting danger, as well as observing anything that may be going on with the ship.
		- NPC: Natsuko Hayashi
	- Leadership (CHA). Addressing or commanding the crew, and anything to do with morale.
		- NPC: Aubrey Galatea
- **Hazards**. Each of the hazards below occurs in sequence, designed to simulate the environment the players would be flying over through the course of the chase as the dragons flies toward Argonnessen.
	- Mists. The dragon's flight path dips into the dead-grey mists of the Mournland. The PCs will need to determine how they maintain visibility in order to keep trailing the dragon.
	- Kraken. Over Kraken Bay, the dragon's flight path descends near the water, and gargantuan tentacles reach out of the water and try to grab at anything they can!
	- 
- Dragon performs a Legendary Action at the end of each round, targeted to a station based on a d6 roll. These actions may disable crew members, stations, or even the entire ship. The Legendary Actions below are performed in order.
