 - [ ]  **Gold Dragon Chase**

- Run as a modified Skill Challenge, with the first to three successes keeping the Heart. Five phases to each round:
	- Hazard occurs
	- Move: choose which station to occupy.
	- Action: Choose Skill to overcome the hazard.
	- Roll: Airship crew and dragon both roll to determine who overcomes the hazard.
	- Dragon Legendary Action
- **Stations**. By default, each station has a crew member with a +2 to their Skill roll. If only the crewmember is there, rolls are at disadvantage. If two are there (NPC and player) then roll is flat, and the player adds their modifier instead of the NPC. If three are there (NPC and two players) then roll is at advantage, and the player with the highest modifier adds theirs. Have a map with each of the six stations on the ship, with a mini for each of the crew NPCs in place. Allow players to move their own minis to wherever they would like to go.
	- **1. Logistics** (STR). Moving supplies from one place to another (jettisoning, battening, resupplying, etc).
		- NPC: Oliver Ramorell (Quartermaster)
	- **2. Ballistics** (DEX). Shooting things!
		- NPC: none
	- **3. Engineering** (CON). Vertical movement, and increasing or decreasing ship's engine power.
		- NPC: Prince Lorrister
	- **4. Piloting** (INT). Horizontal movement, and any complex maneuvers.
		- NPC: Demetrius d'Lyrandar
	- **5. Spotting** (WIS). Spotting danger, as well as observing anything that may be going on with the ship.
		- NPC: Natsuko Hayashi
	- **6. Leadership** (CHA). Addressing or commanding the crew, and anything to do with morale.
		- NPC: Aubrey Galatea
- **Hazards**. Each of the hazards below occurs in sequence, designed to simulate the environment the players would be flying over through the course of the chase as the dragons flies toward Argonnessen.
	- **Mists**. The dragon's flight path dips into the dead-grey mists of the Mournland. The PCs will need to determine how they maintain visibility in order to keep trailing the dragon.
	- **Kraken**. Over Kraken Bay, the dragon's flight path descends near the water, and gargantuan tentacles reach out of the water and try to grab at anything they can!
	- **Mountains**. Over Aerenal, the dragon's flight path leads right between two large mountain peaks. The PCs will need to maintain the ship's path without crashing.
	- **Stormy Seas**. Over the Thunder Sea, a sudden storm kicks up and lightning begins to strike!
	- **Barbarians**. Over Seren Island, barbarians on the beach start shooting large crossbows into the sky!
- **Dragon**. The dragon performs a Legendary Action at the end of each round, targeted to a station based on a d6 roll. These actions may disable crew members, stations, or even the entire ship. The Legendary Actions below are performed in order.
	- **Fire Breath**. The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:12d10` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	- **Hezcalipa's Heart**. The dragon brandishes the Heart, which pulses with a radiant energy. Each creature must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:10d8` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	- **Weakening Breath**. The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	- **Wing Attack**. The dragon beats its wings. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6 + 8` bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
	- **Sleep**. Each creature must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spellâ€™s effect. The dragon can establish telepathic contact with any sleeping creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.
