### Background and Hook(s)

* The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation encountered in [[C01. What Dreams May Come]]), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes, Reigney.

### Characters and Locations

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Nearby town?



 - [ ]  **Apotropaic Temple of the Sphinx**

* Start by rolling Initiative to determine play order. Players can perform any action they normally can, and move their normal speed (on the 5 foot grid of the map tiles). This uses dungeon rounds of 10 minutes.
* Place the Entryway Map Tile (indicated by the star on the back) on the table. All other map tiles must connect to this one, on any of the three hallway connections (the south is the entrance and cannot be used).
* Additional map tiles are placed dynamically (like Betrayal at House on the Hill), as needed when a Move is performed into a space without a tile. Any time a player is leaving a room, there must be a tile for them to go to - otherwise they need to draw the next tile from the stack and place it down appropriately (so hallways connect). If the tile can't be played for some reason, discard it and select a new one. If the map tiles run out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw pile.
- Whenever a new map tile is placed, that player rolls a d6 to determine what (if any) challenges are encountered. 1, 2 = no encounter; 3, 4 = puzzle or trap (roll a d4 and find the appropriate scene below), 5, 6 = monster (see Random Tables).
- There is a "Final Room" tile, that completes the map and prevents further tiles from being played. The person drawing this Tile can choose to discard it instead, even if it could be played. If the Tile is played, then move to the Chamber of the Royal Guardian.

 - [ ]  **1 - Thelanis (Story Sphinxes)**

>In the center of the room is a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. One head is adorned with snakes protruding wildly and a forked tongue sticking out between its fangs. The other two heads are mostly unadorned, but one leaks a purple liquid from its mouth and the other a green liquid. A huge book rests on a pedestal in front of the statue.

* If the players inspect the statue, they notice that the right head is leaking a purple liquid (that is essentially a potion that casts *revivify*), while the left head is leaking a green liquid (this is essentially a potion that casts *power word kill*).
* The book is a magical replica of the Book of Destiny, that can't be removed from the pedestal.

 - [ ]  **2 - Kythri (Time-Traveling Sphinxes)**

* Something to do with time manipulation, or the strange time flow that happens around sphinxes.
* Incorporate the trolley problem (or other philosophical dilemmas) into puzzles somehow? The group does love the trolley problem!
	* Maybe literal small trolleys running through the walls, with levers that allow PCs to change the trolley's path?

 - [ ]  **3 - Xoriat (Prophetic Sphinxes)**

* A representation of the Maze of Reality and/or Draconic Prophecy.

 - [ ]  **4 - Cleansing Chamber**

* Possibly a way to take away the dhampir curse from Thana? And/or make Verity somehow less fallen?
* Some sort of magical amulet, a Gorgoneion, that can cast a powerful spell, but that can only be used once and has an extreme cost.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Royal Guardian**

* Reiney should disappear at the end, after explaining that sphinxes only come into existence to serve a purpose. Should also probably explain the three types of sphinxes.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* This should be the final dungeon before facing the dragons, so the players return to their home continent at the end.
* The asian "sphinx" is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. So lean into these concepts for this dungeon, which should also carry a more eastern inspiration (which is fitting for Sarlona as well).
* Inspired after Apotropaic Temples.
* Use the modular dungeon tiles mini-game.
