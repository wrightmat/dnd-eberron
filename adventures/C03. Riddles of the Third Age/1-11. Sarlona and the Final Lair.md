### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Nearby town?



 - [ ]  **Apotropaic Temple of the Sphinx**

* Start by rolling Initiative to determine play order. Players can perform any action they normally can, and move their normal speed (on the 5 foot grid of the map tiles). This uses dungeon rounds of 10 minutes.
* Place the Entryway Map Tile (indicated by the star on the back) on the table. All other map tiles must connect to this one, on any of the three hallway connections (the south is the entrance and cannot be used).
* Additional map tiles are placed dynamically (like Betrayal at House on the Hill), as needed when a Move is performed into a space without a tile. Any time a player is leaving a room, there must be a tile for them to go to - otherwise they need to draw the next tile from the stack and place it down appropriately (so hallways connect). If the tile can't be played for some reason, discard it and select a new one. If the map tiles run out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw pile.
- Whenever a new map tile is placed, that player rolls a d6 to determine what (if any) challenges are encountered. 1, 2 = no encounter; 3, 4 = puzzle or trap (roll a d4 and find the appropriate scene below), 5, 6 = monster (see Random Tables).
- There is a "Final Room" tile, that completes the map and prevents further tiles from being played. The person drawing this Tile can choose to discard it instead, even if it could be played. If the Tile is played, then move to the Chamber of the Royal Guardian.

 - [ ]  **1 - Thelanis (Story Sphinxes)**

>In the center of the room is a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. One head is adorned with snakes protruding wildly and a forked tongue sticking out between its fangs. The other two heads are mostly unadorned, but appear to be leaking. A huge book rests on a pedestal in front of the statue.

* If the players inspect the statue, they notice that out of the right head is flowing a shimmering purple liquid (that is essentially a potion that casts *revivify*), while the left head is leaking a sinister green substance (this is essentially a potion that casts *power word kill*). Each liquid can only be harvested once, at which time the flow stops.
* The book is a magical replica of the Book of Destiny, that can't be removed from the pedestal. Its pages are filled with cryptic runes and shifting images that seem to hint at the interconnectedness of all things.
	* **DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana)**. The text within the book speaks of the delicate balance between life and death, fate and free will, and chaos and order.
	* **DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)**. "In the enchanted realm of stories, where time intertwines with myth, the sphinxes guard the threads of destiny. Within their gaze, the dance of life and death unfolds, each chapter woven into the tapestry of fate."
	* **DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)**. "In Destiny's Garden, where the paths of fate intertwine, two types of flora pervade. One, an amaranthine bloom with the promise of rebirth. The other, a verdant vine poisoned by the sting of the serpent's venom. Choose with care, for the elixirs of life and death can be claimed only once, their essence a fleeting presence in the ever-turning garden of fate."

 - [ ]  **2 - Kythri (Time-Traveling Sphinxes)**

>The air here shimmers with an otherworldly glow, and in the center of the room sits a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. As you enter the chamber, a celestial voice echoes softly in your minds:
>"Welcome, travelers, to the chamber of the sphinxes of Kythri. Here, amidst the ebb and flow of time, you are faced with a quandary, a philosophical dilemma that transcends the boundaries of mortal understanding."
>"The path before you splits, diverging into two destinies intertwined. On one track lies the salvation of the innocent, their lives hanging in the balance like delicate threads in the tapestry of fate. On the other, a solitary figure stands, a guardian of knowledge and power, their existence a linchpin in the fabric of history."
>"Choose wisely, for the echoes of your decision shall reverberate through the annals of time, shaping the course of events yet to unfold. The trolley approaches, and the weight of destiny rests upon your shoulders."
>With these words, the celestial voice fades, leaving you to contemplate the decisions before you.

* As they approach, the players find a line of tracks splitting into two parallel tracks laid out before them. A celestial voice echoes in their minds, presenting them with a moral dilemma: pull the lever to save a group of innocent bystanders from a speeding trolley by diverting the trolley into one significant individual, or do nothing and sacrifice the entire group. The progression below is from "more human" to "less human", making the thought experiment more interesting.
* The consequences of their choice ripple through time, shaping the destiny of countless lives. The choice could actually impact the world when they return to Khorvaire.
* The same statue from the Thelanis chamber is also here, if they were to look around, but it is not leaking any liquid. The lever for the trolley is in front of the statue. The tracks are on the other side of the statue, and are a miniaturized magical replica of the scenarios below.

1. **Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn of Aundair:** The trolley is on a collision course with a group of innocent civilians in Fairhaven, the capital of Aundair, where Queen Aurala is attending a public event. Pulling the lever would divert the trolley away from the crowd, killing the Queen in the process.

2. **High Cardinal Krozen:** The trolley is headed toward a group of refugees seeking shelter in the sanctuary of the Church of the Silver Flame, where High Cardinal Krozen is delivering a sermon. Choosing to divert the trolley would spare the innocent lives of the refugees, but kill the Cardinal.

3. **Merrix d'Cannith Sr:** The trolley is headed toward a group of Warforged, which appear slightly more primitive than modern Warforged. On the other track is a lone figure tied to the rails, none other than Merrix the Senior (a prominent figure in House Cannith who possesses vital knowledge of the Warforged Creation Forge). Sacrificing him could prevent the Warforged from being fully developed.

4. **Emperor Kaius III of Karrnath:** The trolley is barreling toward a group of undead soldiers, primarily vampires, zombies, and skeletons. On the other track is the current Emperor of Karrnath, Kaius III, whose death might plunge the nation into chaos.

 - [ ]  **3 - Xoriat (Prophetic Sphinxes)**

>As you step into the chamber, the air seems to ripple with a disorienting distortion, as if the very fabric of reality were woven from threads of shifting uncertainty. Strange symbols and arcane sigils dance along the walls, their meanings hidden to all but the most discerning eyes. In the center of the room, a shimmering portal materializes, revealing glimpses of things yet to come.

* **DC 10 Wisdom (Insight)**. A scene of Khorvaire, much as the players know it, but populated entirely by dragons, dragonborn, and other lizardfolk races. Not a single humanoid race can be found anywhere.
* **DC 15 Wisdom (Insight)**. In the night sky is a dark cloud, blotting out all of the moons and much of the Ring of Siberys. The bright glow of night that the players are familiar with is gone, replaced with near darkness.
* **DC 20 Wisdom (Insight)**. A scene of Sarlona, but populated by a civilization of sphinxes. They seem to be studying the dark cloud in the sky, concerned by its increased growth. Flash forward to the civilization being destroyed as the dark cloud slowly takes over the continent of Sarlona.

 - [ ]  **4 - Cleansing Chamber**

* Possibly a way to take away the dhampir curse from Thana? And/or make Verity somehow less fallen?
* Some sort of magical amulet, a Gorgoneion, that can cast a powerful spell, but that can only be used once and has an extreme cost.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Royal Guardian**

* "There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?" The answer is "day and night". If the players answer correctly, Reiney disappears, and if they answer incorrectly the answering PC is turned to stone.
* Reiney should disappear at the end, after explaining that sphinxes only come into existence to serve a purpose. Should also probably explain the three types of sphinxes.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes (the Royal Sphinx Seal).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* This should be the final dungeon before facing the dragons, so the players return to their home continent at the end.
* The asian "sphinx" is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. So lean into these concepts for this dungeon, which should also carry a more eastern inspiration (which is fitting for Sarlona as well).
* Also Inspired by Apotropaic Temples of Greek and Egyptian tradition.
