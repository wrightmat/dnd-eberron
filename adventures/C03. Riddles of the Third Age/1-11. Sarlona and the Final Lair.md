### DM Notes and Random Tables

* This should be the final dungeon before facing the dragons, so the players return to their home continent at the end.
* The asian "sphinx" is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. So lean into these concepts for this dungeon, which should also carry a more eastern inspiration (which is fitting for Sarlona as well).
	* Possibly a room that can take away the dhampir curse from Thana? And/or make Verity somehow less fallen?
* Inspired after Apotropaic Temples.
* Use the modular dungeon tiles mini-game.
* Incorporate the trolley problem (or other philosophical dilemmas) into puzzles somehow? The group does love the trolley problem!
	* Maybe literal small trolleys running through the walls, with levers that allow PCs to change the trolley's path?
* An area where there's a hole in the wall, and something the players need on the other side. Aither's rat could fit through the hole and retrieve it, but maybe there's a trap or something?
* Reiney should disappear at the end, after explaining that sphinxes only come into existence to serve a purpose. Should also probably explain the three types of sphinxes.
