### Background and Hook(s)

* The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation encountered in [[C01. What Dreams May Come]]), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes, Reigney.

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Nearby town?



 - [ ]  **Apotropaic Temple of the Sphinx**

* Start by rolling Initiative to determine play order. Players can perform any action they normally can, and move their normal speed (on the 5 foot grid of the map tiles). This uses dungeon rounds of 10 minutes.
* Place the Entryway Map Tile (indicated by the star on the back) on the table. All other map tiles must connect to this one, on any of the three hallway connections (the south is the entrance and cannot be used).
* Additional map tiles are placed dynamically (like Betrayal at House on the Hill), as needed when a Move is performed into a space without a tile. Any time a player is leaving a room, there must be a tile for them to go to - otherwise they need to draw the next tile from the stack and place it down appropriately (so hallways connect). If the tile can't be played for some reason, discard it and select a new one. If the map tiles run out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw pile.
- Whenever a new map tile is placed, that player rolls a d6 to determine what (if any) challenges are encountered. 1, 2 = no encounter; 3, 4 = puzzle or trap (roll a d4 and find the appropriate scene below), 5, 6 = monster (see Random Tables).
- There is a "Final Room" tile, that completes the map and prevents further tiles from being played. The person drawing this Tile can choose to discard it instead, even if it could be played. If the Tile is played, then move to the Chamber of the Royal Guardian.

 - [ ]  **1 - Thelanis (Story Sphinxes)**

>In the center of the room is a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. One head is adorned with snakes protruding wildly and a forked tongue sticking out between its fangs. The other two heads are mostly unadorned, but appear to be leaking. A huge book rests on a pedestal in front of the statue.

* If the players inspect the statue, they notice that out of the right head is flowing a shimmering purple liquid (that is essentially a potion that casts *revivify*), while the left head is leaking a sinister green substance (this is essentially a potion that casts *power word kill*). Each liquid can only be harvested once, at which time the flow stops.
* The book is a magical replica of the Book of Destiny, that can't be removed from the pedestal. Its pages are filled with cryptic runes and shifting images that seem to hint at the interconnectedness of all things.
	* DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana): The text within the book speaks of the delicate balance between life and death, fate and free will, and chaos and order.
	* DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana): "In the enchanted realm of stories, where time intertwines with myth, the sphinxes guard the threads of destiny. Within their gaze, the dance of life and death unfolds, each chapter woven into the tapestry of fate."
	* DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): "In Destiny's Garden, where the paths of fate intertwine, two types of flora pervade. One, an amaranthine bloom with the promise of rebirth. The other, a verdant vine poisoned by the sting of the serpent's venom. Choose with care, for the elixirs of life and death can be claimed only once, their essence a fleeting presence in the ever-turning garden of fate."

 - [ ]  **2 - Kythri (Time-Traveling Sphinxes)**

>In the center of the room is a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. One head is adorned with snakes protruding wildly and a forked tongue sticking out between its fangs. The other two heads are mostly unadorned. In front of the statue runs a series of tracks.

* No liquid leaks from this central statue.
* Something to do with time manipulation, or the strange time flow that happens around sphinxes.
* Incorporate the trolley problem (or other philosophical dilemmas) into puzzles somehow? The group does love the trolley problem! With the time travel component it could explain the ability to retry the problems over and over again.
	* Maybe literal small trolleys running through the walls, with levers that allow PCs to change the trolley's path?

 - [ ]  **3 - Xoriat (Prophetic Sphinxes)**

>In the center of the room is a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. One head is adorned with snakes protruding wildly and a forked tongue sticking out between its fangs.

* A representation of the Maze of Reality and/or Draconic Prophecy.

 - [ ]  **4 - Cleansing Chamber**

* Possibly a way to take away the dhampir curse from Thana? And/or make Verity somehow less fallen?
* Some sort of magical amulet, a Gorgoneion, that can cast a powerful spell, but that can only be used once and has an extreme cost.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Royal Guardian**

* "There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?" The answer is "day and night". If the players answer correctly, Reiney disappears, and if they answer incorrectly the answering PC is turned to stone.
* Reiney should disappear at the end, after explaining that sphinxes only come into existence to serve a purpose. Should also probably explain the three types of sphinxes.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* This should be the final dungeon before facing the dragons, so the players return to their home continent at the end.
* The asian "sphinx" is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. So lean into these concepts for this dungeon, which should also carry a more eastern inspiration (which is fitting for Sarlona as well).
* Also Inspired by Apotropaic Temples of Greek and Egyptian tradition.
