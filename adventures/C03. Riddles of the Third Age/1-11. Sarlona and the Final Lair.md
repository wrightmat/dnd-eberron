### Background and Hook(s)

* The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation encountered in [[C01. What Dreams May Come]]), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes, Reigney.

### Characters and Locations

* **Reigney** (King of the Sphinx).
* **Gerazan Sandaili** (NG male human sorceror). Sahar of Nderitese, and therefore leader of the region. He is known for his psionic abilities.
* **Immasa** (NG female eneko bard). Chief Ambassador to the other regions of Sarlona. She has blue skin and white hair, and a fairly significant overbite, which betrays her "mongrel" half-giant and ogre ancestry.
* **Ky** (NN non-binary eneko cleric). A former member of the Wanderers of Twilight, Ky is one of the best sources of information on cult activity â€” they remain one of the few people to flee their ranks and live to tell about it.
* **Dalassakash'alyntar** (LG male shulassakar cleric). Servant of the Flame that Binds.
* **Zoshu** (CN male yuan-ti). Bartender at Scales and Cocktails.

* **Nderitese**. The capital of the [[locations/Syrkarn|Syrkarn]] region of Sarlona.
* **Lair of the Royal Guardian**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Nderitese** (nearby town)

>As you approach the capital city of Nderitese, you are struck by the grandeur of its architecture. Towering columns, straight lines, and square arches dominate the skyline, creating an imposing yet awe-inspiring sight. The buildings, constructed from sturdy wood and stone, stand as testaments to the city's strength and resilience, their buttressed walls and arched entrances hinting at their enduring legacy. Amidst this imposing backdrop, you notice a woman waiting patiently for you, her blue skin and white hair marking her as a unique blend of half-giant and ogre.

This is the capital of the [[locations/Syrkarn|Syrkarn]] region of Sarlona. When the players arrive, they're approached by Immasa, who greets them as the Chief Ambassador for the Syrkarn government - she has been told that the group was coming, and can accompany them wherever they need to go (including to the legendary temple of the sphinx king).

* **Sahar Hall**. Government Center, where Immasa works.
* **Wanderers of Twilight Temple**. Central temple for the Wanderers of Twilight cult, which has the mission to protect and expand the manifest zones that pervade Sarlona.
* **Temple of the Flame that Binds**. A temple to the Silver Flame run by Dalassakash'alyntar and attended by the shulassakar. They view the Church of the Silver Flame as a limited form of their true religion for more limited beings, as the followers of the modern Church need Tira Miron and the Keeper of the Flame to interpret the couatl's wishes for them.
* **Scales and Cocktails**. A sketchy tavern that serves mostly yuan-ti clientele, known as just "Scales" (both the people and the place) by the rest of the population. Due to yuan-ti history, they know much about the continent of Argonnessen and the history of the dragons.

 - [ ]  **Apotropaic Temple of the Sphinx**

* Start by rolling Initiative to determine play order, performed in dungeon rounds of 10 minutes. Players can perform any action they normally can, and move their normal speed (on the 5 foot grid of the map tiles).
* Place the Entryway Map Tile (indicated by the star on the back) on the table. All other map tiles must connect to this one, on any of the three hallway connections (the south is the entrance and cannot be used).
* Additional map tiles are placed dynamically (like Betrayal at House on the Hill), as needed when a Move is performed into a space without a tile. Any time a player is leaving a room, there must be a tile for them to go to - otherwise they need to draw the next tile from the stack and place it down appropriately (so doors connect). If the tile can't be played for some reason, discard it and select a new one. If the map tiles run out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw pile.
- Whenever a new map tile is placed, that player rolls a d6 to determine what (if any) challenges are encountered. 1, 2, 3 = scene (roll a d4 and find the appropriate scene below, re-rolling any already encountered scenes), 4, 5 = monster (see Random Tables, and optionally roll for initial disposition), 6 = nothing.
- There is a "Final Room" tile, that completes the map and prevents further tiles from being played. The person drawing this Tile can choose to discard it instead, even if it could be played. If the Tile is played, then move to the Chamber of the Royal Guardian scene below.

`dice: [[1-11. Sarlona and the Final Lair#^random-monster-encounter]]`

 - [ ]  **1 - Thelanis (Story Sphinxes)**

>In the center of the room is a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. One head is adorned with snakes protruding wildly from the top and a forked tongue sticking out between its fangs. The other two heads are mostly unadorned, but appear to be leaking. A huge book rests on a pedestal in front of the statue.

* If the players inspect the statue, they notice that out of the right head is flowing a shimmering purple liquid (that is essentially a potion that casts *revivify*), while the left head is leaking a sinister green substance (this is essentially a potion that casts *power word kill*). Each liquid can only be harvested once, at which time the flow stops. Looking straight into the eyes of the middle statue forces the player to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, turning them to stone (per the petrified condition) on a failure.
* The book is a magical replica of the Book of Destiny, that can't be removed from the pedestal. Its pages are filled with cryptic runes and shifting images that seem to hint at the interconnectedness of all things (read only the highest one below, based on the roll).
	* **DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana)**. The text within the book speaks of the delicate balance between life and death, fate and free will, and chaos and order.
	* **DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)**. "In the enchanted realm of stories, where time intertwines with myth, the sphinxes guard the threads of destiny. Within their gaze, the dance of life and death unfolds, each chapter woven into the tapestry of fate."
	* **DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)**. "In Destiny's Garden, where the paths of fate intertwine, two types of flora pervade. One, an amaranthine bloom with the promise of rebirth. The other, a verdant vine poisoned by the sting of the serpent's venom. Choose with care, for the elixirs of life and death can be claimed only once, their essence a fleeting presence in the ever-turning garden of fate."

 - [x]  **2 - Kythri (Time-Traveling Sphinxes)**

>The air here shimmers with an otherworldly glow, and in the center of the room sits a stone statue, composed of three heads on a winged lion body. As you enter the chamber, a celestial voice echoes softly in your minds:
>"Welcome, travelers, to the chamber of the sphinxes of Kythri. Here, amidst the ebb and flow of time, you are faced with a quandary, a philosophical dilemma that transcends the boundaries of mortal understanding."
>"The path before you splits, diverging into two destinies intertwined. On one track lies the salvation of the innocent, their lives hanging in the balance like delicate threads in the tapestry of fate. On the other, a solitary figure stands, a guardian of knowledge or power, their existence a linchpin in the fabric of history."
>"Pull the lever if you choose to change the tracks. But choose wisely, for the echoes of your decision shall reverberate through the annals of time, shaping the course of events yet to unfold. The trolley approaches, and the weight of destiny rests upon your shoulders."
>With these words, the celestial voice fades, leaving you to contemplate the decisions before you.

* As they approach, the players find a line of tracks splitting into two parallel tracks laid out before them. A celestial voice echoes in their minds, presenting them with a moral dilemma: pull the lever to save a group of innocent bystanders from a speeding trolley by diverting the trolley into one significant individual, or do nothing and sacrifice the entire group. The progression below is from "more human" to "less human", making the thought experiment more interesting.
* The consequences of their choices ripple through time, shaping the destiny of countless lives. The choice could actually impact the world when they return to Khorvaire.
* The statue is the same as the one from the Thelanis chamber, but it is not leaking any liquid. The lever for the trolley is in front of the statue. The tracks are on the other side of the statue, and are a miniaturized magical replica of the scenarios below. Each scenario takes place in one round, with the trolley proceeding at the bottom of initiative, so each PC has an opportunity to perform one action (including one of them using their action to pull the lever, if they choose).

1. **Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn of Aundair:** The trolley is on a collision course with a group of innocent civilians in Fairhaven, the capital of Aundair, where Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn is attending a public event. Pulling the lever would divert the trolley away from the crowd, killing the Queen in the process.

2. **High Cardinal Krozen:** The trolley is headed toward a group of refugees seeking shelter in the sanctuary of the Church of the Silver Flame, where High Cardinal Krozen is delivering a sermon. Choosing to divert the trolley would spare the innocent lives of the refugees, but kill the Cardinal.

3. **Merrix d'Cannith Sr:** The trolley is headed toward a group of warforged, which appear slightly more primitive than modern warforged. On the other track is a lone figure tied to the rails, none other than Merrix d'Cannith Sr.
	- Merrix the Senior is a prominent figure in House Cannith who possesses vital knowledge of the Warforged Creation Forge.
	- Sacrificing him could prevent the warforged from being fully developed.

5. **Emperor Kaius III of Karrnath:** The trolley is barreling toward a group of undead soldiers, primarily vampires, zombies, and skeletons. On the other track is the Emperor of Karrnath, Kaius III, whose death might plunge the nation into chaos.

 - [x]  **3 - Xoriat (Prophetic Sphinxes)**

>As you step into the chamber, the air seems to ripple with a disorienting distortion, as if the very fabric of reality were woven from threads of shifting uncertainty. Strange symbols and arcane sigils dance along the walls, their meanings hidden to all but the most discerning eyes. In the center of the room, a shimmering portal materializes, revealing glimpses of things yet to come.

Describe as many of the portal images below as is appropriate for the Wisdom (Insight) roll.

* **DC 10 Wisdom (Insight)**. A scene of Khorvaire, much as the players know it, but populated entirely by dragons, dragonborn, and other lizardfolk races. Not a single humanoid race can be found anywhere.
* **DC 15 Wisdom (Insight)**. In the night sky is a dark cloud, blotting out all of the moons and much of the Ring of Siberys. The bright glow of night that the players are familiar with is gone, replaced with near darkness.
* **DC 20 Wisdom (Insight)**. A scene of Sarlona, but populated by a civilization of sphinxes. They seem to be studying the dark cloud in the sky, concerned by its increased growth. Flash forward to the civilization being destroyed as the dark cloud slowly takes over the continent of Sarlona.

 - [ ]  **4 - Cleansing Chamber**

>As you enter the chamber, a soft glow emanates from the walls, suffusing the room with a soothing aura of purity and sanctity. In the center lies a pristine altar, adorned with intricate carvings depicting symbols of divine protection and celestial grace. Upon the altar rests a sacred relic, a shimmering vial filled with radiant liquid.

* When any character with any darkness inside (for example Thana's dhampirism or Verity as a fallen aasimar) touches the Gorgoneion vial of radiant liquid, they hear a celestial voice in their head. If they choose to drink the liquid, then they alone must face off against a representation of their darkness (or somehow convince it to stand down instead). If they succeed, then their darkness is instantly removed. Reigney can also explain this, should they choose to hold onto the vial instead of drinking it right away (he will know they have it).
* When any players without any darkness inside (for example Aither) touches the liquid, they hear a celestial voice in their head. If they choose to drink the liquid, they heal completely and gain temporary hit points equal to their hit point maximum.

Celestial Voice (if the player has darkness inside):
>"Child of shadow, behold the light of purification, a beacon to dispel the darkness that lingers within. Drink this sacred elixir, and face the embodiment of your inner turmoil. Confront the shadows that bind you, and emerge cleansed in the radiance of redemption."

Celestial Voice (if the player does not have darkness inside):
>"Bearer of light, the purity of your soul remains untainted by the shadows that haunt others. Though this elixir may hold no challenge for you, its brilliance serves as a testament to the strength of your resolve. Embrace its radiance, and let it illuminate your path with clarity and grace."

When a player with darkness succeeds in their combat:
>With each strike against the embodiment of your darkness, you could sense its hold over you weakening. Finally, as you strike the decisive blow, a brilliant burst of light erupts from within you, dispersing the shadows that once clouded your soul. You are left feeling lighter, purer, as if a heavy burden has been lifted from your very being. As you stand before the altar, bathed in the ethereal glow of the chamber, you feel a surge of divine energy coursing through your veins.

`encounter: 1: Greater Shade` (at half HP)

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Royal Guardian**

>A sense of awe washes over you as your gaze falls upon the majestic sanctum of Reigney, the sovereign of the sphinxes. The air is heavy with a palpable aura of ancient wisdom and regal authority, echoed by the intricate tapestries adorning the walls, depicting scenes of legendary feats and timeless wisdom. At the heart of the chamber, atop a grand throne of polished marble and purple velvet, sits the resplendent form of a sphinx with the head of a human, the legs of a deer, and fairy-like wings.

>"Welcome, seekers of truth and guardians of destiny," the voice reverberates through the chamber, resonating with an otherworldly authority. "You have braved the trials of the sphinxes to stand before me, and in doing so, you have proven yourselves worthy of the wisdom I possess. Speak, and I shall impart unto you the secrets of the cosmos, for within the labyrinth of time and fate, your destinies are intertwined with the threads of eternity."

* Give the players a chance to ask whatever final sphinx questions they may have. Reigney should also reveal any existing details about the topaz dragon (and their obsidian dragon leader) plan to release the overlord Tiamat, probably using the souls they harvested at Shai Mordai.
* Reigney should make it clear that they are not yet strong enough to face the dragons and their scheme to release Tiamat. He should direct them to two possible locations (both of which should be done eventually):
	* The party should return to Sharn and report their progress to Flamewind (at which time Sharn will be attacked by white dragons). [[1-12. Xen'drik and the Ruined Lair]]
	* His sibling, Stygianos, a fallen sphinx now known as a Gypsosphinx, has created a hidden lair somewhere in the central deserts of Khorvaire. He may recommend the players visit Karrnath, Talenta Plains, or Q'barra in order to gather more information about the area. [[2-01. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]]
* When everything else is done, Reigney presents them with one final riddle before disappearing:

>I have one final inquiry for you. "There are two siblings: one gives birth to the other and it, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two siblings?"

* The answer is "day and night" (or sun and moon). If any player answers incorrectly, they're immediately turned to stone (per the petrified condition). If they answer correctly, then Reigney disappears.

>"I am but a vessel for the will of destiny, a keeper of truths and guardian of paths. My existence is bound to the tapestry of fate, and in guiding you, I have fulfilled my purpose. Go forth, seekers, and may the wisdom you have gleaned illuminate the shadows of uncertainty that shroud your journey. Fare thee well, for my time in this realm draws to a close."
>With those words, Reigney's form begins to fade, his visage dissipating into the ether as if carried away by the winds of time itself.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes (the Royal Sphinx Seal).
 - [ ]  There are three types of Sphinxes: Prophetic Sphinxes, Time-Traveling Sphinxes, and Story Sphinxes.
 - [ ]  Story Sphinxes are tied to Thelanis and are primarily agents of Destiny to keep the Book of Destiny's will on track.
 - [ ]  Time-Traveling Sphinxes are tied to Kythri and are agents of a future civilization of Sphinxes that are trying to prevent their civilization from dying at the end of the Third Age of Eberron.
 - [ ]  Prophetic Sphinxes are tied to Xoriat and the Maze of Reality, and are agents of the Draconic Prophesy.
 - [ ]  All of the Sphinxes are concerned about recent events because they have potential to advance the Age more quickly than it's supposed to go.
 - [ ]  The yuan-ti emerged from Khunan following the mage-wars that began the Sundering, and unified the region into the nation of Syrkarn. The Inspired led an invasion of the nation, and drove most of the yuan-ti out of Sarlona. The fleeing yuan-ti were offered sanctuary by the dragons of Argonnessen. The yuan-ti were eventually driven from the continent after a cult of yuan-ti in the city of Io'vakas uncovered forbidden magic. The dragons destroyed the city, and many surviving yuan-ti fled across the sea for Xen'drik.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* The asian "sphinx" is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. So lean into these concepts for this dungeon, which should also carry a more eastern inspiration (which is fitting for Sarlona as well).
* Also Inspired by Apotropaic Temples of Greek and Egyptian tradition.
