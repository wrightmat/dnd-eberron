### Background and Hook(s)

* The Map of Sphinx Sightings has several visible markings indicating sightings in the area.
* Valrok in Valenar mentions the Brass Bards and their possible origination from Zilargo.

* **Zirael** (Criosphinx)
* **Rannik Aeris** (male dwarf/brass dragon). Leader of the Brass Bards troupe, and secretly a brass dragon.

* **[[Zolanberg]]**
* **Shimmerwood Forest**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [x]  **[[Zolanberg]]** (nearby city)

* A stationary Brass Bards troupe started up here just a few weeks ago, led by a charismatic dwarf leader (Rannik Aeris, who always wears a brass ring on every finger) who is actually a disguised brass dragon.

 - [x]  **Shimmerwood Labyrinth** (DC 12)

* Use the Mazes with Cards mechanics with the three scenes below serving as the "trap" cards, and the Chamber of the Mysterious Guardian being discovered when enough Right Path cards are collected.
* **Victory Condition**: 6 Right Path Cards or Kill the Monster.
* **Traps** (d6): 1-2: Hall of Illusions, 3-4: Cauldron of Curiosity, 5-6: Echoing Whispers
* **Monster**: `encounter: 2: Displacer Beast`

>An ancient labyrinth unveils itself amidst the emerald embrace of this ancient forest. As your gaze ascends, the labyrinth's towering stone walls stretch impossibly high, creating an intricate tapestry against the vibrant hues of the Shimmerwood Forest canopy. Massive vines, adorned with luminescent blossoms, cascade down the labyrinth's exterior, weaving an otherworldly cascade of color and light. The air is filled with the sweet fragrance of exotic flowers that seem to thrive in the labyrinth's colossal presence.

* To be read as the players move deeper into the labyrinth, such as when they encounter any of the rooms below:

>As you traverse the labyrinth's meandering passages, sunlight filters through the open canopy at the summit, casting dappled patterns of light and shadow on the labyrinth's weathered stones.

 - [x]  **Hall of Illusions**

* Players face illusions that test their resolve - roll on the table below once for each character. Each PC may make a Wisdom saving throw to determine if they can see through the illusion, with a failure resulting in the dictated effect, which lasts until they succeed on a new Wisdom save.

 - [ ]  **Cauldron of Curiosity**

* Players encounter a bubbling cauldron emitting a mist that instills bravery. They must drink from it to gain a boon, making a Wisdom saving throw to resist potential side effects. On a success, the PC gets 1d8 of Bardic Inspiration, and on a failure they are subject to the effects of a *[[confusion]]* spell.

 - [x]  **Echoing Whispers**

* A path filled with whispers that provoke self-doubt. Players must pass a Wisdom (Insight) check or succumb to the whispers, suffering disadvantage on checks until they dispel the doubts (can repeat the check as on action on any subsequent turns).

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Wise Guardian**

>This central chamber is bathed in the soft glow of luminescent flora, revealing the regal form of a creature bearing the head of a ram and body of a lion. The air carries the harmonious sounds of nature, from the gentle rustling of leaves to the distant melodies of unseen birds. Aromatic scents of blooming flowers and earthy moss pervade. The cool, slightly damp stone floor contrasts with the warm breath of the sphinx, its graceful movements almost palpable.

* Zirael should reward the PCs with the Blue [[Dragon Mask]], as well as a small artifact that can be used to reveal hidden secret (the UV flashlight for the Map of Sphinx Sightings).

>"In the realm of whispers and deceit, only the sharp of mind can distinguish truth from falsehood. Your wisdom has been tested, and you have done well to find this place. I am at your service," he says, bowing deeply.
