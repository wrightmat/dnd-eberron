### Background and Hook(s)

* Deep in an unnamed forest exists a glade rumored to hold great power. Legend tells that the dragon Vvaraak once spread druidic teachings from this glade, over sixteen thousand years ago. Although not as holy a site as Vvaraak’s Cave, which lies somewhere in the Shadow Marches, the Mystic Glade still bears the touch of the Prophecy.
* Vvaraak's Cave is the former home of the black dragon Vvaraak who created the Gatekeeper druids, and is now the central base of the Order of the Onyx Scale (Dragon Orcs) and the black dragon Moar’donn as their leader.

### Characters and Locations

* **Moar’donn** (CE male black dragon). Leader of the Order of the Onyx Scale.

* **Mystic Glade**
* **Vvaraak's Cave**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Mystic Glade

 - [ ]  **Approaching the Mystic Glade**

* Paths twist through the forest, but none lead directly to the Mystic Glade. The trails fork, branch, and double back. The thick forest canopy blocks out the stars, affording only an occasional glimpse of the sky, which makes navigation difficult. A pilgrim can find the way to the glade with a successful DC 20 Survival check. Forest creatures and wild animals unerringly confront travelers with ill intentions or greedy hearts, disrupting their progress. One path, in no way discernible from the others that wind through the forest, opens up into a shadowy glade. A group of three majestic trees with metallic bark stand at the northern edge of the glade, a bubbling brook trickling from their roots.
* The Mystic Glade, suffused so often with druidic magic while the Scaled Apostate conducted her lessons, bears an aura of nature’s power still. Creatures in the glade cast druid spells at +1 caster level. No matter the time of day outside, within the glade it’s always twilight. The stars, moons, and the Ring of Siberys seem twice as large and bright when viewed from here, and the heavenly bodies constantly rearrange themselves in patterns that resemble dragonmarks.
* Any player spending any amount of time studying the patterns in the sky can roll an Intelligence (Arcana) check. Starting with DC 8 (revealing one fact), a new fact is revealed for every +2, from the "Mystic Glade Prophesies" table.
* The glade measures 80 feet across and is almost perfectly circular. Grass and wildflowers cover the unusually flat and even ground. Though verdant, the grass is rough and uneven, and the wildflowers grow in wildly colored clumps. A constant soft breeze stirs the flowers, shaping and reshaping their dancing heads into Prophecy marks.

 - [ ]  **The Three Trees**

* Three immense bronzewood trees stand in the northern part of the glade, non-native to this region but flourishing. Whatever the season, the trees’ leaves display a variety of fall colors, and some hues not seen in nature. The leaves rustle in the ever-present breeze, and whispers suffuse the glade, vague sentences that tease the edge of hearing and speak of destiny.
* The bronzewood trees are worth a fortune, but powerful magic guards them. Anyone who tries to harvest the towering plants faces three angry treants when the bronzewoods animate. Gatekeeper druids who serve the order well and selflessly might sometimes be allowed to take a branch from the bronzewood trees to fashion a weapon or piece of armor; such branches come easily away from the trees and regrow in 24 hours.

`encounter: 3: Treant`

 - [ ]  **The Brook**

* The bubbling brook that erupts from the bronzewoods’ roots is always fresh and pure. Tiny pebbles on the brook’s bed constantly shift and rearrange in the current, forming mystic patterns. The brook dwindles and sinks into the ground shortly after it leaves the glade. Anyone who drinks from the brook gains the benefit of *[[cure wounds]]* (5th level) and *[[remove curse]]*. The water loses this property if removed from the brook. Any evil characters attempting to drink from the brook are attacked by the bronzewood treants.

##### 2: Kobold Den

 - [ ]  **Old Approach**
>The masonry walls of this twenty-foot-wide hall are in poor repair. The far end has collapsed, filling the southern section with rubble. The western wall is in much better shape than the other walls, and it holds a stone door with a rearing dragon carved in relief on it. The door has a single keyhole, situated in the rearing dragon's open mouth.

**Dragon Door**. The door that is carved to look like a dragon has a mechanical lock as well as an arcane Jock spell cast on it. The Strength (Athletics) check to defeat the arcane lock is DC 30, and the Dexterity check to bypass the magical lock using thieves' tools is DC 25. Casting a knock spell on the door suppresses the magical lock for 10 minutes, lowering the DCs by 10 during that time. The mechanical lock remains intact if the magical lock is bypassed, requiring another knock spell or the use of the key. The key, which bypasses the magical lock as well as the mechanical one, is in area 21.

 - [ ]  **Gallery of Forlorn Notes**
>As the door opens, a hissing noise and a puff of dust around the door indicate that the chamber beyond has been sealed for ages. Dust, long undisturbed, covers every surface in this large gallery. The air here is stale. Three alcoves are on the north wall, and one is on the south wall. Each alcove contains a dust-covered stone pedestal with a fist-sized crystalline globe resting on it. The globes in the northern alcoves are cracked and dark, but the globe in the southern alcove glows with a soft blue light. Faint tinkling notes issue from it.

If a character moves within 5 feet of the lit globe, brooding music begins to play throughout the area, and the sound carries into areas 6, 8, and 9 if the doors to those areas are open. Any creature that can hear the music must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the music of the globe for 24 hours. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed and, while charmed in this way, can take only the Dash action and move toward area 3. The effect on a creature ends once that creature reaches the floor beyond the pit trap in area 3. If an affected creature is prevented from moving to area 3, the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The effect ends on its own 1 minute after the creature can no longer hear the music. A creature can escape the music by being on the other side of a closed door that leads to the gallery, or by vacating the area (including adjacent rooms) where the music is audible.

The globe has AC 10 and 10 hit points. If it is attacked or handled, the music becomes louder, audible in areas 4 and 10 if the doors to those areas are open. The DC of the Wisdom saving throw then increases to 20. If the globe is reduced to 0 hit points or taken from the room, it cracks and goes dark and silent. It no longer functions.

 - [ ]  **Pressure Plate**
>The air is stale in this twenty-foot-long corridor, which leads to another closed stone door.

**Arrow Trap**. Each time any weight is placed on any part of the center 10-foot-square section of the corridor, a mechanical pressure plate is activated, triggering a trap. An arrow fires from above the western door at the creature who triggered the trap: +5 to hit, 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone around it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or some other similarly sized and sturdy object under the pressure plate prevents it from activating.

 - [ ]  **Dragon Riddle**
Dust fills this hall like a layer of gray snow. In the rounded northern end of the chamber stands a ten-foot tall sculpture of a coiled dragon carved from red-veined black marble.

**Dragon Sculpture**. If a creature moves within 5 feet of the dragon statue, a magic mouth spell causes the dragon to utter a riddle in Common (to viewers, it seems as though the stone jaws are actually moving). The dragon's riddle is as follows:

>We come at night without being fetched; we disappear by day without being stolen. What are we?
(Answer: stars)

Secret Door. A secret door in the western wall leads to area 10. Finding the door requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Under the scrutiny of detect magic, the door radiates a faint aura of abjuration magic. The door comes open, pivoting into the room, only if someone speaks the answer to the riddle. Once the door is opened, it closes on its own 1 minute later, although any obstruction placed in the doorway prevents it from doing so. The door can be opened from the western side with a simple push.

 - [ ]  **Honor Guard**
>Dust cloaks the contents of this twenty-foot-wide hall. Six alcoves line the walls, three to the north and three to the south. Each alcove except the southwest one holds a humanoid figure carved of red-veined white marble. The figures resemble tall elves in plate armor. A stone archway at the west end of the hall opens into a wide room from which greenish light glows. A dark pit is situated before the archway.

**Southwest Alcove**. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the dust in the room is disturbed by tracks that start in the southwest alcove, though the tracks are filled in enough that the disturbance must have occurred dozens of years ago. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check enables a character to determine that the tracks were made by tiny humanoid feet with claw-like nails. They begin in the center of the alcove, move west toward the pit, and then disappear into the pit. A character who enters the pit to follow the tracks must make another successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check to pick up the trail again.

**Spiked Pit**. The pit is 10 feet deep, and its bottom is filled with spikes that deal 11 (2d10) piercing damage to a creature that falls in, as well as falling damage. The walls of the pit are rough, and they offer handholds to climbers. Area 12 begins on its far side.

**Creature**. A quasit named Jot was bound in the southwestern alcove an age ago to guard the contents of the sarcophagus in area 12. It was in suspended animation until a few decades ago, and it now waits on the other side of the arch just out of sight in area 12. Jot is alerted by any light source the characters have, so it can prepare for them. (If the characters have no light source and are stealthy, Jot might not become aware of them.) The quasit darts out of its hiding place and attacks the first creature that climbs out of the pit on the western side.

**Development**. Jot doesn't fight to the death. If it takes any damage, or if more than one character attacks it, Jot laughs and says, "You broke the binding. My watch over the dragonpriest is over!" It uses its next action to become invisible. It then turns into a bat and flies along the 10-foot-high ceiling across the pit. If Jot escapes, the characters might see it again. It knows that death on the Material Plane means a return to the Abyss, so it prefers to harass the characters while they are otherwise engaged, laughing and mocking as it does so. Secret Door. Finding the door on the southern wall requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door opens with a simple push inward.

 - [ ]  **Secret Room**
>Dust coats the contents of this tiny chamber, obscuring runes inscribed on the southern wall.

**Inscription**. If the southern wall is cleared of dust, I the runes are revealed to be a message in Draconic. Someone who can read the language understands it as "A dragonpriest entombed alive for transgressions of the Law still retains the honor of his position."

**Secret Door.** A secret trapdoor in the floor requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. The door opens by pulling it upward. It leads to a 3-footby-3-foot crawl space that connects to a similar trapdoor in area 12.

 - [ ]  **Tomb of a Failed Dragonpriest**
>Violet marble tiles cover the floor and walls, though all are cracked or broken, revealing rough-hewn stone beneath. Sconces are attached to the walls at each corner. One holds a torch that burns with greenish fire. A marble sarcophagus, easily nine feet long, lies in the room's center. The coffin is carved with dragon imagery, and the head of the sarcophagus resembles a dragon's head. Rusting iron clasps firmly lock down the lid.

**Torch**. The greenish fire is a continual flame spell.

**Sarcophagus**. Six rusted iron latches hold down the sarcophagus lid. Opening a single latch requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the six latches are opened, the lid can be removed with a successful DC 15 Strength check or by the effort of any combination of characters whose combined Strength is 30 or higher. Inside, a dragonpriest lies imprisoned, kept alive by virtue of a sequester spell that is dispelled with a flash of green light when the sarcophagus is opened. If the characters look inside, read:
>In the coffin is a troll! It's dressed in rotted finery, but its jewelry and rings adorned with tiny silver dragons still sparkle. The creature's body is shrunken and elongated, and its flesh is a rubbery, putrid green. Its black hair is long, thick, and ropy. Its beady black eyes flash open, and it snarls.

This dragonpriest delved into magic that the dragon cult deemed profane-he permanently transformed himself from an elf into a troll. For this crime, the cult entombed him alive, though the honor of his station remained. The dragonpriest attacks his rescuers, his mind all but transformed to that of a troll over the ages of his burial. He had a name, but he has forgotten it, although he has not forgotten how to speak Elvish and Draconic.

**Creature**. In his current state, the dragonpriest is slower and weaker than a normal troll. Use troll statistics, but the dragonpriest starts with 30 hit points, regenerates only 5 hit points per round (up to normal for a troll), and can't use Multiattack. If he is defeated in this state, the dragonpriest is worth 450 XP.

**Development**. The dragonpriest won't pursue fleeing characters. Instead, he continues to repose in his tomb until hunger finally draws him forth to hunt five days later. By that time, he uses the normal troll statistics, retaining his additional languages.

**Treasure**. The dragonpriest has an ornate ceremonial dagger (worth 125 gp), two silver rings (15 gp each), and a silver amulet (15 gp). Scattered across the bottom of the sarcophagus are 220 sp, 50 gp, and four spell scrolls: command, cure wounds (2nd level), inflict wounds (2nd level), and guiding bolt (2nd level).

 - [ ]  **Empty Room**
Several empty rooms in the fortress have the same characteristics. Nothing of note can be found in any of them.

>This ruined chamber stands empty of all but a litter of rocky debris.

 - [ ]  **Enchanted Water Cache**
>The stone relief-carved door sealing this chamber portrays a dragon-like fish swimming.
 
The door is locked but can be opened with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. If the door is opened, read:
>This ten-foot-square chamber is hewn from stone. It contains an upright keg fashioned of rusted iron. Rusted pipes lead from the keg into the floor.

If anyone shakes or strikes the keg, the sound of sloshing liquid comes from inside it. The connecting pipes hold the keg in place, preventing it from being detached. The characters can remove a wide metallic bung on the keg's top with a successful DC 15 Strength check, or someone can easily stave in the side of the keg.

**Creatures**. If the keg is breached, the ice mephit and the steam mephit confined within it are released. The creatures attack anyone who has disturbed the keg.

**Treasure**. Within the keg are five tiny sapphires (worth 10 gp each) used to bring about the magic that bound the mephits.

 - [ ]  **Dragon Cell**
>Crudely executed symbols and glyphs, scribed in bright green dye, decorate this large and irregularly shaped crumbling chamber. A large pit in the center shows evidence of a recent fire. A metallic cage in the middle of the southern wall contains a gaping hole and stands empty. A small wooden bench draped with green cloth is next to the cage, and several small objects rest on it. A bedroll lies near the wooden bench, and the sound of whimpering comes from inside it.

Until recently, the kobolds confined a black dragon wyrmling in the cage and placed it under heavy guard. Those guards were not strong enough to stand against a sortie by goblins that stole the wyrmling a week ago.

**Creature**. Meepo, the kobold who was his tribe's Keeper of Dragons, is now the sole occupant of the chamber. He is heartsick at the loss of the wyrmling and spends much of his time nowadays in nightmare-ridden sleep in his bedroll. With the loss of his charge, Meepo's status is in the gutter. He doesn't react to anything short of loud noise or direct prodding. If he is disturbed, Meepo is frightened but willing to talk. He is weepy. His numerous obvious scars are souvenirs of his job as Keeper of Dragons. If he is asked about the cage or queried in any way that mentions a dragon, he says, "The clan's dragon... we lost it. The wretched goblins stole Calcryx, our dragon!"

To all other questions, Meepo responds by saying, "Meepo don't know, but Yusdrayl does. Meepo take you to meet Yusdrayl, our leader, if you make nice. You get safe passage, if you promise to make nice. Maybe if you promise to rescue dragon, Yusdrayl make nice to you, answer questions."

Meepo perks up as he senses the possibility of getting the dragon back. True to his word, he guides the characters to area 21. Along the way, he shouts out "Ticklecorn!" (in Draconic) from time to time, explaining that it's a password that tells other kobolds the characters are friendly. If the characters leave Meepo behind, or if they are antagonistic toward him, the characters don't learn the password, and all other kobolds are hostile toward the party.

**Development**. If combat occurs in this chamber, the kobolds in the nearby area 16 are alerted, and they rush out to meet enemies. Investigating. The symbols on the walls are crudely formed in Draconic and read, "Here There Be Dragons." The metallic cage is all but destroyed and can't be used to restrain captives. A search of the cage reveals black scales that someone who has proficiency in Nature or Survival can determine to be from no natural animal. A successful DC 15 check using either skill identifies the scales as those of a black dragon wyrmling. The firepit, if its ashes are sifted, is found to hold charred bits of kobold bones and armor.

**Treasure**. The bench serves as a sort of tiny altar. Resting on it are containers of green dye, a paintbrush made of goblin-hair bristles, and four tiny jade figurines of dragons (worth 15 gp each). A thorough search of the firepit and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals another jade figurine.

 - [ ]  **Kobold Guardroom**
Three rooms in the fortress serve as kobold guard stations. All have the same characteristics.

**Door Trap**. The door leading to the room is trapped with a tripwire that the kobolds connect after shutting the door. Hitting this tripwire, 2 inches off the ground stretched between opposite door frames and running up the frame, causes the trap to trigger. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the wire. If a character then succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, the tripwire is cut without triggering the trap. A character can attempt this check using any edged weapon or edged tool in place of thieves' tools, but does so with disadvantage.

On a failed Dexterity check, the trap triggers, tipping over a clay pot of offal, garbage, and dragon droppings that falls on any creature in the doorway and splatters in a 5-foot radius. A creature hit by the stuff must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

The kobolds release the tension on the tripwire when they exit, meaning that any guardroom that has been vacated can be entered safely.

>A small pit of embers, built of broken masonry and portions of shattered stone sculptures, smolders in the center of this chamber. Arrayed around the pit are several small rugs woven of matted hair and dead fungi.

**Creatures**. The room serves as a barracks and guard post for the kobold tribe's warriors. Three kobolds stand guard inside, unless they have already come forth to reinforce other kobolds. If the characters try to talk and the interaction is successful, the kobolds direct the characters to head toward "Yusdrayl on her dragon throne," giving them simple directions to area 21 and warning them to avoid rousing the ire ofYusdrayl's elite guards.

 - [ ]  **Dragon Chow**
A character who approaches the door can smell the stench of what lies beyond. If the door is opened, read:
>Rats fill the room, trapped among their own waste. A small half-barrier prevents the rats from easily escaping when the door is open.

**Creatures**. The rats are used as food for the dragon wyrmling that was once stabled in area 15. Since the abduction of the dragon, the kobolds have neglected the rats, and in the meantime the rodents have chewed away the fastenings of the barrier. One round after someone opens the door, the rats knock the barrier over and rush out, attacking as a swarm of rats for 1 round, after which they disperse into the dungeon.

 - [ ]  **Prison**
Each door that lead to the prison chamber is locked, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to unlock, and also barred on the outside with an iron rod. If a character attempts to open either door while any kobolds are present, the kobolds warn against doing so. Opening a door in spite of this warning turns the kobolds hostile.
>Four small humanoids are shackled by thick, rusted chains attached to a large iron spike set in the floor. Several broken weapons and sundered shields lie in one corner.

**Creatures**. Four orcs are chained here, taken prisoner during the course of several skirmishes. Every so often, the kobolds remove an orc from the room and ransom it back to the orcs (for a price of 2d10 sp). Those who can't be ransomed are bound for the kobold cook pot. The orcs whine and cower pathetically if any characters enter the room. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can open the lock on the chains, or the chains can be broken (Strength DC 20) or sundered (AC 15, 60 hit points).

The orcs promise anything and everything in exchange for their release, including safe passage for the characters to their chief. The creatures have no power to guarantee their promises, however. In addition, if the orcs are released, any understanding the characters have with the kobolds is voided. Freed orcs flee at the first hint of trouble, and they double-cross their rescuers if threatened by other orcs.

 - [ ]  **Hall of Dragons**
>A double row of relief-carved marble columns march the length of this long, large hall. The worn carvings depict entwining dragons.

**Creatures**. An elite squad of three kobolds (each with 7 hit points) patrols the hall, considering the duty an honor. The guards pay particular attention to the door that leads to area 24, which is along the route traditionally used by goblin raiders. These kobolds react to the character's presence in the same way as the ordinary ones described in area 16. If the characters head for area 21 without causing hostilities, these guards follow the characters into Yusdrayl's presence.

**Development**. If combat erupts here, the result is likely to be deadly for the party. Any kobolds remaining in the areas nearby enter the room as reinforcements. Yusdrayl and her two guards arrive from area 21 at the start of the second round of combat. At the start of the fifth round, the kobolds in the area 16 to the southwest of this room come on the scene. At the start of the eighth round, the kobolds from area 23 enter the fray. (Kobolds that leave their original area and are slain here should be noted for possible future reference.)

 - [ ]  **Kobold Colony**
The strong wooden door that leads to the kobolds' living quarters is barred from the inside. Characters who give the proper password ("Ticklecorn!" spoken in Draconic; see area 15) or who make a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check can convince the kobolds within to unbar the door. Otherwise, the kobolds open the door only when guards return to the room for a shift change.
>Several small but smoky fires light this wide and high chamber. Spits, tanning racks, and other implements of a primitive culture are visible through the haze. Several small figures busily work and play within the chamber.

Twenty-four kobolds occupy the room, but only three kobolds are capable warriors that challenge unescorted intruders. Seven other kobolds are commoners, but with 3 hit points each, and a -1 reduction to hit and damage compared to the Monster Manual statistics. The other tribe members here are too young, too old, or too cowardly to defend themselves; they flee if combat breaks out and are worth no XP. Even the kobolds capable of fighting run away if they are outmatched.

The kobolds here answer all questions with a quick "Yusdrayl knows." An attack on these kobolds brings reinforcements, as described in area 19, though each group arrives 1 round later because of the extra distance it must traverse.

 - [ ]  **Dragon Throne**
>A short throne stands near the west wall, constructed of fallen bits of masonry stacked against an old altar. On the top of the altar sit a variety of small items. The portion of the altar that serves as the throne's back features a carving of a rearing dragon. A metallic key is held firmly in the dragon's open jaws.

**Creatures**. Normally sitting on the throne is the kobolds' leader, Yusdrayl (see appendix B). Two elite kobolds (7 hit points each) guard her. Those who come to Yusdrayl's chamber can talk to her; she is hostile only if she knows that the characters have slain other kobolds. Characters who antagonize her while talking earn the leader's ire and a savage attack.

Yusdrayl can speak to the following questions:
- Why are kobolds in this place? "Kobolds are heir to dragons. As the mightiest among my people, I have led a brave few to this ancient holy site, where dragons were worshiped long ago." Yusdrayl knows nothing else about the history of the fortress, except the name of the dragon that was once revered here, which is Vvaraak.
- What about the orcs? "The Order of the Onyx Scale is headquartered below. The dragon-thieving orcs are part of that order."
- What about the monsters? "The monsters are servants of the druidic order, trying to chase us out of our cave! They are more numerous below, in the Twilight Grove."
- What about the stolen wyrmling dragon? "The orcs stole our dragon! If you return Calcryx to us. I shall grant you a reward. Meepo can accompany you if you desire."

If the characters decide to go looking for the dragon, the kobolds direct them toward the passage that connects area 15 and area 25, which is the "back way" into goblin territory. Yusdrayl and her followers know nothing useful about the goblin lair. If the characters take Meepo with them, he can serve as their guide to that location. If Meepo goes along and is slain, the kobolds count it as a small loss as long as the dragon is rescued. Possible rewards include the key in the carved dragon's mouth, or any two of the items on the altar. Yusdrayl is also willing to sell the key for 50 gp. Development. If hostilities break out, reinforcements arrive in the manner described in area 19. If the characters return Calcryx, Yusdrayl can be convinced to aid them in an assault on the remaining goblins. You determine the nature of the aid. Treasure. The key clenched in the mouth of the carved dragon opens the door to area 7. Yusdrayl has keys to area 18 and the chains there, a key to the doors in area 24, and a key that once fit the cage in area 15. She also has 35 gp. The items assembled on the altar include a Quaal's feather token (tree), three spell scrolls (mage armor, spider climb, and knock), and a small flask that contains three doses of elixir of health. 22.LARDER The odor of rotting meat permeates this chamber. Most of the rusty iron hooks in the ceiling are empty, but a few hold the skinned carcasses of large vermin, huge fungoid stalks, and several massive insect carapaces. On a small, battered bench along the south wall are pieces of nearly useless cutlery and rusting skinning knives. The kobolds bring food for their tribe up from the Underdark and store it in a nearby chamber. The rotting flesh is that of rats, bats, overlarge cave crickets, beetles, goblin parts, and spiders. The room also has a selection of fungi and mushrooms. 23. UNDERDARK ACCESS The floor is partially collapsed on the east side of this room, revealing a tunnel. The passage is unworked, and it fluctuates widely in width, height, and direction as natural tunnels do. Within the room, hunting gear is racked on the wall, and several pallets lie nearby.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The glade is one location where Vvaraak, also known as the Scaled Apostate, taught the principles of druidic magic to Gatekeeper orcs over ten thousand years ago.
 - [ ]  Gatekeeper druids find the Glade hospitable, and the waters there have healing powers. Creatures opposed to the Gatekeeper philosophy have difficulty approaching the glade.
 - [ ]  Three bronzewood trees grow in the glade.
 - [ ]  The glade offers valuable insights to Chamber agents and others who seek to understand the Prophecy.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Create random table for "Mystic Glade Phophesies" that give the players clues to other adventures in other parts of the world, or clues into the goals of the dragons.
* Use the "Sunless Citadel" adventures from Tales of the Yawning Portal for Vvaraak's Cave. Adjust encounters to be more draconic (and probably more difficult, so eliminate things like goblins), adjust descriptions to fit the cave setting, and shorten as needed (including eliminating the inner Glade since we have the outer one). Will probably want to draw an actual map on gridded paper for the cave portion.
* Monsters: Mavka (ToB1), Miremal (ToB1), Moss Lurker (ToB1), Swamp Naga (ToB2), Quickserpent (ToB2)
