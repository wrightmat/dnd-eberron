### Background and Hook(s)

* 

### Characters and Locations

* **Windsor Stone** (LG male human barbarian). A scholar who studies the planes and spends much of his him in an Observatory he constructed at the Gate of Xabra on top of one of the residential towers of Arcanix.
* **Astra** (CG non-binary kalashtar sorcerer). Windsor's partner and often assistant in his research.
* **Aeon** (LG male angel). Verity's father.
* **Elyriel** (NN female angel). The Veiled Flame, Ninth among the Burning Host of Syrania, Elyriel appears as a tall, lithe celestial being, draped in flowing robes that shimmer with hues of azure and silver, and serves as guardian of any temporary portals to Eberron, including the Gate of Xabra. Elyriel embodies the calm and contemplative nature of Syrania, yet her demeanor conceals a fierce protectiveness over the portal she guards. She is wise and speaks in a melodious voice that resonates with the harmony of the plane.
* **Miraela Thespir** (LN female aasimar). A famed merchant at the Immeasurable Market, who offers rare potions and poisons. Miraela has luminescent skin that subtly glows in dim light, silvery-white hair, and deep azure eyes. She dresses in elegant, flowing garments in soft pastels. Miraela is composed and enigmatic, with a calm demeanor. She is fair but firm in her dealings, valuing ethical conduct in business. Despite her firmness, she has a deep sense of empathy, balancing it carefully with her business interests.
* **Dread Morgan / Morganna** (NE female hag, disguised as a moon elf). In her true form, Dread Morgan appears as a thin, pale creature whose long, matted black hair is festooned with ornaments made from bones and teeth. Her mouth curves up unnaturally high at the corners, and her bloodred lips are covered in blisters and boils. In her disguised form, the hag appears as Morganna, a slender moon elf with smooth black hair and sparkling sapphire eyes. She speaks in a husky, alluring voice and focuses on the business of running the bathhouse. Dread Morgan knows the ritual needed to bind a creature's desire to a cursed painting, which is recorded on a tiny scroll hidden in a bone ornament in her hair.
* **Vile Sazha / Azirssa** (CE female hag, disguised as a sun elf) Without her disguise, the chaotic evil Vile Sazha appears as a hunched figure with one muscular and one withered arm. She has catlike eyes, and rustred hair covers her head, back, and arms. Her sharp fangs cause her to slur when she speaks, and she hisses and screeches when threatened. In her disguised form, she appears as Azirssa, an athletic sun elf with copper hair who wears an ornate breastplate with a red fur mantle. She has a confident and jovial voice, and she promotes physical strength and good health. Vile Sazha knows how to create a suitable canvas for the hags' cursed paintings. This secret is tattooed on her withered arm in Infernal, and it describes a macabre process of stretching elven flesh over a frame made from blood-soaked wood.
* **Auntie Greenbones / Greensong** (LE female hag, disguised as a wood elf). The eldest member of the Fetid Gaze, the lawful evil Auntie Greenbones often defers to the other two hags on decision-making. In her true form, she is shriveled and worn, her dark green skin covered in bark and fungus. Insects crawl across her and hide in the thick braid of white hair that curls around her shoulders like a serpent. Anyone who stares into her milky-white, seemingly blind eyes sees a reflection of their own face made decrepit and withered by age. The hag's disguise is that of Greensong, a cheerful, rosy-cheeked wood elf who feigns blindness. She wears a delicate white veil across her eyes and speaks in a singsong voice, giggling often. She keeps her guard dog, Morty, with her at all times. This disguised hell hound appears as a mastiff with bloodshot eyes. Auntie Greenbones knows how to infuse demon ichor into the paints needed to create the cursed paintings that drive the coven's evil bargains. This recipe is inscribed on the inside of Morty's collar.
* **Sylvarie Silversong** (NG female moon elf). Founded the Temple of the Restful Lily after being drawn to the hot spring by the visions of Sune. Her deep-seated insecurity over serving the angel of beauty was her downfall. Hoping to develop more confidence in her role as a priest of Sune, she was drawn into a bargain with the hags that saw her transformed into a medusa and trapped in the temple's former shrine for ten years. See area T12 for more information.
* **Gorba Daardenrian** (LN female silver dragonborn). A mighty warrior who sought even greater strength through her bargain with the hags. When she realized the true nature of the bargain shortly before the curse struck, the dragonborn returned to the temple to challenge the coven, but she became a withered husk of her former self as she arrived (use the commoner stat block for her current state). Now trapped here, she is especially fearful of Vile Sazha, who torments her relentlessly.
* **Glitter** (CG male tiefling). A jeweler in Sharn, as well as an informant for one of the City Watch. He came to the temple wanting to be a few inches taller, thinking the extra height would prove advantageous when conducting business transactions, but he renounced the hags' bargain when his new, taller form didn't suit him. The hags' curse transformed him into a kobold (though he uses the spy stat block). In his new form, Glitter now bitterly serves the hags, speaking eloquently and addressing guests kindly. If the characters agree to help him undo the hags' curse, Glitter assures them they will gain a powerful ally in Sharn, as well as receive 500 gp in gems as soon as he can return to the city.
* **Falthrax Loderr** (NG shield dwarf commoner). Became fearful of growing old after a lifetime of dedication to Morgrave. After coming through the portal and being drawn in by the splendor and magic of the bathhouse, he bargained with the hags to restore his youth. But when second thoughts caused him to renounce the bargain, the hags' curse aged him well into his venerable years, and he is now wracked with constant pain. Having no idea how to return to Sharn and his old life, he has accepted his fate with quiet resignation, and he weeps quietly to himself when anyone speaks to him.

* **[[Arcanix]]**
* **[[Therendor (Syrania)]]**
* **Temple of the Restful Lily**. This grand temple and bathhouse rests in a serene and ancient grove. The temple was built by Sylvarie Silversong, after visions bestowed by Sune led her to a hot spring infused with magic. Some years ago, a coven of green hags calling themselves the Fetid Gaze tricked Sylvarie into a bargain that allowed them to take over the bathhouse. These cruel and cunning fey now use the temple to lure wealthy, greedy, and vain nobles and adventurers, preying on their insecurities and tricking them into accepting dark bargains that ultimately lead to misery. The temple consists of three buildings. What was once Sylvarie's private tower has been taken over by the hags as a lair, and a former shrine to Sune has become a prison for the cursed elf. The main bathhouse looks exactly as Sylvarie built it, and it continues to provide services to visitors (although most of the staff of the bathhouse are the coven's wicked minions in disguise).

### Scenes and Situations

#### 1: The Gate of Xabra

 - [ ]  **Arcanix and the Observatory**

The adventure begins in Arcanix, where Windsor, leveraging his scholarly knowledge, aids the party in activating the Gate of Xabra. Valmoc, aware of celestial disturbances affecting both Syrania and the Material Plane, entrusts them with a mission to restore balance. Valmoc knows Professor Stone personally, as he has spent time in Arcanix doing work for the Silver Scales (in fact he went there when after leaving the party last time when they went to Sarlona).

Valmoc should direct the party to the school, and then toward Professor Windsor Stone. The players of course may explore any areas of Arcanix, including the village or the school itself.

 - [ ]  **The Plane of Syrania**

>Professor Stone uses a finger to trace a certain series of glyphs on the stones, which glow slightly as east is completed. When all the glyphs have been traced, everything within the Gate of Xabra disappears with a whoosh of air. In the next instance, you find yourself floating among the clouds.

Behind the players is a perfectly circular cloud that serves as a glowing portal back to the Gate of Xabra in Eberron. In front of them is Elyriel, who serves as the angelic guardian of temporary gates from Eberron (such as the Gate of Xabra). She is friendly to the players (and unfamiliar with Verity, since she's fairly new to the job), and directs them if they want to go anywhere, suggesting they at least visit the planes-famous Immeasurable Market.

If needing to move the story forward, any conversation can interrupted by a merchant from the Immeasurable Market arriving to challenge Verity.

#### 2: The Slighted Merchant

 - [ ]  **The Immeasurable Market**

When the players approach the Immeasurable Market, a merchant quickly approaches the group and confronts Verity. This confrontation can also occur when they arrive at the plane if they decide to try going somewhere other than the Immeasurable Market. The merchant, a female aasimar named Miraela, is the one who Verity stole their mother's cure from. She is adamant that Verity owes her payment, and that she must hand over a soul or be reported to both Castiel and her father.

But Miraela is fair, and she would allow Verity to retrieve a few rare items from a rarely visited place called the Undercloud instead. One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage, that would cover the payment. The other item is something for Miraela's personal collection, a book which features a magical mirror on the front.

>An aasimar woman flies hurriedly toward you, and fixes her deep azure eyes on Verity, her expression serene yet unmistakably firm. She speaks in a clear, calm voice, "Verity, it has been some time since our last encounter. I see the paths you've chosen have led you back. Let us speak of past deeds and their weight on the present, shall we?"
>She turns toward the rest of you. "I am Miraela Thespir, a steward of rare and powerful potions and poisons. They and I have met before, under less forthright circumstances involving a certain invaluable cure they once acquired without transaction." Her tone softens slightly, addressing everyone in the group, "I propose an opportunity to balance our accounts. Venture into the Undercloud to retrieve two items: a golden lotus flower, which holds the soul of an enlightened mortal sage, and a book adorned with a magical mirror. These will settle your debt and perhaps, restore a bit of harmony to our relations."

 - [ ]  **The Undercloud**

The party needs to move silently through the drifting motes of earth or cloud, avoiding detection by the guardians of these artifacts, mist dancers known as Bereginyas. The party may use environmental elements or illusion spells to create distractions, drawing guardians away from the items they seek.

`encounter: 1: Bereginyas`

Once the book adorned with a magical mirror ("The Price of Beauty") is collected, it speaks to anyone who observes it. When any creature holds The Price of Beauty and gazes into the mirror, the image of Sune replaces their own reflection and speaks in a soft voice, saying, "Well met, dearest one. How do you feel today?"

The mirror's unique illusion magic reacts and responds to the creature looking into it. Though it is not sentient and cannot answer complex questions, the mirror offers encouragement and advice on grooming and self-confidence. As it does so, the illusion shows the creature looking into the mirror, but changing and grooming its skin, hair, makeup, and clothing as desired. If the creature holding the book is happy with how it looks, or shows no interest in such matters, the illusion reverts to a normal mirror until used again.

If the creature holding the book mentions a desire to change something about itself, or that it feels unwell, tired, or unhappy, the illusion responds, "If rest, relaxation, or transformation is what you need, then follow the lilies, dearest one. I am sure Sylvarie will see to your needs." The mirror then glows softly, and a 5-foot-wide, 7-foot-high portal appears in the nearest unoccupied space. The portal leads to an old woodland trail marked by posts that resemble sculpted stone lilies. As the characters will discover, the portal leads to a temple and bathhouse run by three elf sisters, where all is not as it seems.

> [!info]+ Book Description
> *The Price of Beauty* is bound in soft green leather, eight inches wide and fourteen inches tall, and set with golden clasps. The book gives off the unmistakable scent of lilies. Set into its cover is a polished oval mirror with a delicate gold frame styled like locks of hair, which appear to spill down around the face of anyone who looks into the mirror.
> The book is filled with beautiful illustrations of woodland scenes, art, and jewelry. Delicate handwriting accompanies the illustrations, in the form of short prayers and meditations dedicated to seeking self-worth, techniques for massage and healing, and recipes for creating balms and cosmetics.
On the last page is an inscription by the author, Sylvarie Silversong, which reads: "A mirror is a gateway to happiness, truth, and to accepting ourselves."

#### 3: The Price of Beauty

 - [ ]  **Temple of the Restful Lily**

The Temple of the Restful Lily is built around a fey-enchanted hot spring in a large open grove in the High Forest. The woodland trail accessed through the portal created by The Price of Beauty leads to the temple from the east after a journey of a quarter mile. A longer trail leads west from the temple, winds northward, and ends at the edge of the forest. Both trails converge on the south side of the bathhouse building and the double doors leading into area Tl.

If the characters put off entering the bathhouse building to first wander the grounds, the cambion Saeth leaves area T1 to intercept them. He encourages the characters to return with him to the bathhouse, describing the abandoned shrine as a dangerous place to be avoided, and saying that the tower is a private residence that cannot be entered. He does not force the issue, however.

##### Temple Features
- **Walls and Floors.** The bathhouse and the tower are luxuriously appointed, with walls and floors of polished stone. The stonework in the abandoned shrine is crumbling and caked with grime.
- **Doors**. Inside the bathhouse and the tower, wooden doors are carved with images of water lilies. Doors in the bathhouse are normally unlocked, but they can be locked by anyone who has a master key. Doors in the tower are normally locked. Unless otherwise noted, a locked door can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, broken in with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, or attacked. A door has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
- **Windows**. Within the bathhouse and the tower, finely made windows display abstract designs in stained glass. A window can be broken through with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check or attacked; each one has AC 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
- **Light**. All areas of the bathhouse and the tower are filled with bright light during the day and evening, either from sunlight or lanterns. After midnight, these areas are dark unless characters are using a light source. The ground floor of the shrine (area T11) is unlit, while its basement is lit by a magic pool (see area T12 for details).

##### Temple Locations

###### T1. Lobby
>The double doors open to the sound of a bell. Beyond the doors is a large lobby, the air heavy with the scent of fresh lilies. A desk stands at the center of the room, holding neatly piled papers and fresh-cut lilies in a vase. A dark-haired man in fine clothes stands up from behind the desk as he sees you.
>"Welcome, friends, to the Restful Lily. Freshen yourselves in our luxurious bathhouse. Or perhaps you'd enjoy a massage? Haircut? A shave or pedicure? Oh! Road-tired feet simply cry out for comfort! Whatever your pleasure, I am here to serve."

The lobby is staffed by the disguised cambion Saeth. He greets the characters warmly and is happy to explain the treatments and services on offer (as noted in the "Relaxing at the Restful Lily" sidebar). If the characters aren't interested in the Restful Lily's services at present, he encourages them to look around. In any event, as soon as he is able to do so, he leaves the characters to their own devices and slips away to inform one of the hags about the party's arrival before returning to his desk. The characters are free to explore the temple on their own at this point.

###### T2. Changing Rooms
>A corridor beyond the lobby runs between two rows of curtained cubicles, where guests can change out of traveling clothes and armor. Each cubicle contains a wooden stool, two white robes hanging on hooks, and a large wooden trunk with a lock.

If the characters pay to enter the baths or want to enjoy any of the other facilities, they are asked to change and store their weapons and equipment here. One robe of each pair is sized for Medium characters, while the other fits Small characters. Saeth gives a character a numbered key that corresponds to that character's cubicle and trunk. He carries a master key that opens all the trunks. As an action, a character can try to pick the lock on a trunk using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or force open a trunk with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.

###### T3. Lounge
>Large cushioned chairs are set around this open space. Calming music fills the air, which carries a floral scent. A bar takes up one corner of the room, alongside shelves of expensive wines and spirits and baskets of fresh fruit. Two tables stand along one wall, each set up as a manicure and pedicure station with nail files, clippers, and bottles of nail varnish.

The lounge is watched over by two members of the staff, who serve drinks to the guests and perform other mundane tasks asked of them. Both are disguised scarecrows. The music is a permanent auditory illusion. During the day, the hag Dread Morgan is often here in the guise of the moon elf Morganna, talking to other guests and trying to convince likely prospects to indulge in the temple's "special treatments." She takes notice of the characters and welcome them, playing the part of a gracious host while she tries to learn as much about them as possible.

T4. Garden
An iron fence overgrown with ivy surrounds this small
garden. An earthen path weaves between a scattering
of trees, flower bushes, and stone benches. Various
iron weights, wooden poles, and heavy sacks are
strewn about the place.
In the guise of Azirssa, one of the elf sisters, Vile
Sazha uses the garden as a place to exercise and
torment guests with physical training. One of the
trees in the garden is an awakened tree under her
control, which she uses in her workouts and which
defends her if she is attacked.
When the characters arrive, a few other guests of
the temple might be here, looking exhausted and
clutching aching limbs while the disguised hag sarcastically
congratulates them on doing their best.
Azirssa's Workouts. Any character who wants to
can join in one of the hag's workouts. If any characters
look particularly unfit or scrawny, Vile Sazha
singles them out and tries to goad them into joining
in, offering them a magic potion if they can complete
three activities. A character can give up, ending a
workout activity at any time. The three activities are
as follows:
Squats. To complete this activity, a character must
perform three sets of continuous squats and succeed
on three incrementally harder Constitution
checks-DC 10, DC 13, and DC 16, respectively.
A character who fails a check has disadvantage
on the next Constitution check they make as part
of this activity. A character who fails three checks
in a row must finish a short or long rest before attempting
this activity again.
Tug-of-War. To complete this activity, a character
must stay on their feet in a tug-of-war against the
awakened tree. Have the character make DC 16
Strength (Athletics) checks until a check either
fails by 5 or more or succeeds. In the former case,
the character falls prone and takes 3 (ld6) bludgeoning
damage from being pulled to the ground
by the tree. In the latter case, the character wins
the tug-of-war. In either case, the contest ends.
Chain Skipping. To complete this activity, a character
must succeed on three DC 13 Dexterity
(Acrobatics) checks, representing their attempt
to stay on their feet while they try to jump over a
heavy metal chain being spun by Vile Sazha and
the awakened tree. If a check fails, the character
is knocked off balance, and the DC for the next
check becomes 15. If a check fails by 5 or more,
the character is also struck by the chain and takes
7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.



 - [ ]  **Dark Bargains and Cursed Paintings**

>[!info]+ The Fetid Gaze
>Three green hags named Dread Morgan, Vile Sazha, and Auntie Greenbones were once rivals who dwelled in an area of the Feywild coterminous with the High Forest. A decade ago, during a time when the boundaries between the planes thinned, the hags became aware of the magic spring controlled by Sylvarie - and decided to control and corrupt it for their own purposes. The covetous hags each knew part of a ritual for crafting magic paintings that could bind mortal creatures with a terrible curse. After agreeing to share their knowledge and work together, they formed a coven dedicated to claiming Sylvarie's temple and making it a base for their nefarious plans.
>The hags use their powers of illusion to pose as three elf sisters named Morganna, Azirssa, and Greensong. They are typically found in the bathhouse by day and in their tower lair at night. Each hag carries a master key that opens all the doors in the bathhouse and the tower.

The hags use Sylvarie's tower as their personal lair, but they spend their days in the bathhouse, maintaining their disguises. There, they meet with visitors and seek out potential new clients to manipulate. At night, they retreat to the tower and torment their current victims before resting.

If any guests become suspicious of the hags or their minions, the hags try to use *suggestion* or *dominate person* to isolate those characters so they can be captured or killed discreetly. Once the hags become aware that the adventurers aren't at the temple for its services, they try to distract them by beseeching the characters for aid, in exchange for one of their special rituals. The hags first try to recruit the characters to destroy Cyrena, the naiad who is bound to the baths (area T5), claiming that a "capricious elemental spirit" has been attacking guests and trying to claim the bathhouse as its home. If the characters appear particularly capable or dangerous, the hags might also try to trick them into destroying Sylvarie in the sacred pool below the abandoned shrine (area T12), hoping that the cursed elf-turned-medusa petrifies one or more of them in the process.

The coven's greatest weakness is the hags' contempt for one another. Each yearns to learn the others' secrets for creating the cursed paintings so that they can replace their rivals with their own daughters one day. Characters who learn these secrets can thus gain considerable leverage over the hags.

The process of creating the cursed paintings that are the hallmark of the Fetid Gaze was first attributed to a night hag grandmother whose name other hags fear to speak. The method remains shrouded in secrecy, and each member of the Fetid Gaze knows only one part of the procedure. Each hag guards her knowledge zealously, fearing that giving up her secret would make her expendable to the other hags.

Disguised as elves, the hags tempt guests into undergoing magical transformations. Their rituals, which they call treatments, seem entirely beneficial on the surface (see "Magic Treatments" below), and the hags are skilled at tricking guests into thinking the benefits outweigh the cost.

The price for these special rituals is described as "some small boon," which the sisters promise to call for within a year. Any creature that accepts the bargain is taken to the studio in the temple tower (area T15), where the sisters work together to paint a beautiful portrait of the creature over a period of 1 hour. At the end of that time, the magic of the portrait alters the creature in the desired manner.

The benefits granted by the bargain normally last for a year. After that, the beneficiary suddenly experiences the opposite of the intended effect of the ritual, which transforms the creature into the dark reflection of its initial desire. For example, those who sought physical power are weakened to the point of helplessness, while those who sought beauty become hideous to behold. If a creature renounces the hags' gift before the year is up, this curse takes effect immediately. Over the last ten years, the hags have cursed hundreds of victims, most of whom have perished as a result of their dark bargains.

>[!info]+ Magic Treatments
>The magical benefits that the hags typically offer to NPCs can take whatever form makes sense for the story. If one or more of the characters enter into a bargain for the hags' services (even if only to learn more of the procedure), use the following guidelines to determine the benefit to the character.
>- **Ability Enhancement**. If engaging in a bargain to enhance physical or mental acuity, the character chooses one ability. The score for that ability increases by 2, as does the character's maximum for that score.
>- **Physical Transformation**. A character bargaining with the hags can choose to change their race, sex, or appearance in any way they desire. The character retains their ability scores and class features, but changes their racial traits if applicable.
>- **Youth**. A character who bargains for youth has their age reduced to one year older than the standard for adulthood (as noted in the traits for the character's race).
>All such benefits last no longer than a year, and they end immediately if the painting of the character created by the hags is destroyed. If a character keeps their painting for a year or renounces the bargain, you can decide what effect the curse brings about. A cursed character also gains the following flaw, which suppresses any conflicting personality trait the character already possesses: "My appearance and how others perceive me is of the utmost importance to me."

The paintings' magic persists even if the hags are killed, and destroying a painting is the only way to end its curse. Any creature that studies all three parts of the procedure for creating a cursed painting knows that the painting is impervious to damage unless its magic can be momentarily disrupted. Without full knowledge of the procedure, it takes 1 hour of studying a painting and a successful DC 18
Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine this fact.

A creature can use an action to try to destroy a painting, doing so with a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed check, the creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage. Any character who uses an action to examine the painting knows, with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check, that the painting can also be destroyed by splashing it with fresh blood from a celestial. A compulsion placed on each cursed creature prevents it from trying to destroy a cursed painting.

When the players return to Arcanix, they should somehow be introduced to Empress [[Corrine ir'Wyrnarn]], and the conflict brewing between the green dragons of the Eldeen Reaches (allied with Corrine) and the gold dragons of Thrane, with Aundair being the middle ground that's sturing up the conflict. Maybe the Empress is visiting the University for some reason?

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Use Valmoc to get the party to Arcanix, where he went to recently when he left the group to see his old friend Professor Stone. The Professor has discovered a powerful arcane signature coming from the plane of Syrania, via the Gate of Xabra that he maintains.
* When they get there, have Valmoc fly off to The University, where he will be studying as much arcane knowledge as possible to pass on to Yllosavax.
* Verity should be confronted by the merchant she stole from in the Market, and asked to pay up. Since she's likely not willing to hand over a soul, the merchant offers an alternative - to retrieve some rare merchandise from a place known as the Undercloud. If she doesn't agree, then the merchant threatens to turn her over to her father.
	* One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage.
* Otherwise, focus on social encounters and maybe political intrigue here.
* Also adapt "The Price of Beauty" from Candlekeep Mysteries (pg 75)
