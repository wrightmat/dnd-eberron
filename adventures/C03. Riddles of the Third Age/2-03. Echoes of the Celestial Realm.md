### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Gate of Xabra

 - [ ]  **Arcanix and the Observatory**

The adventure begins in Arcanix, where Windsor, leveraging his scholarly knowledge, aids the party in activating the Gate of Xabra. Valmoc, aware of celestial disturbances affecting both Syrania and the Material Plane, entrusts them with a mission to restore balance. Valmoc knows Professor Stone personally, as he has spent time in Arcanix doing work for the Silver Scales (in fact he went there when after leaving the party last time when they went to Sarlona).

Valmoc should direct the party to the school, and then toward Professor Windsor Stone. The players of course may explore any areas of Arcanix, including the village or the school itself.

 - [ ]  **The Plane of Syrania**

>Professor Stone uses a finger to trace a certain series of glyphs on the stones, which glow slightly as east is completed. When all the glyphs have been traced, everything within the Gate of Xabra disappears with a whoosh of air. In the next instance, you find yourself floating among the clouds.

Behind the players is a perfectly circular cloud that serves as a glowing portal back to the Gate of Xabra in Eberron. In front of them is Elyriel, who serves as the angelic guardian of temporary gates from Eberron (such as the Gate of Xabra). She is friendly to the players, and directs them if they want to go anywhere. After any introductions though, their conversation is interrupted by a merchant from the Immeasurable Market.

When the players return to Arcanix, they should somehow be introduced to Empress [[Corrine ir'Wyrnarn]], and the conflict brewing between the green dragons of the Eldeen Reaches (allied with Corrine) and the gold dragons of Thrane, with Aundair being the middle ground that's sturing up the conflict. Maybe the Empress is visiting the University for some reason?

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Use Valmoc to get the party to Arcanix, where he went to recently when he left the group to see his old friend Professor Stone. The Professor has discovered a powerful arcane signature coming from the plane of Syrania, via the Gate of Xabra that he maintains.
* When they get there, have Valmoc fly off to The University, where he will be studying as much arcane knowledge as possible to pass on to Yllosavax.
* Verity should be confronted by the merchant she stole from in the Market, and asked to pay up. Since she's likely not willing to hand over a soul, the merchant offers an alternative - to retrieve some rare merchandise from a place known as the Undercloud. If she doesn't agree, then the merchant threatens to turn her over to her father.
	* One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage.
* Otherwise, focus on social encounters and maybe political intrigue here.
* Also adapt "The Price of Beauty" from Candlekeep Mysteries (pg 75)
