### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Gate of Xabra

 - [ ]  **The Arcanix Observatory**

The adventure begins in Arcanix, where Windsor, leveraging his scholarly knowledge, aids the party in activating the Gate of Xabra. Valmoc, aware of the celestial disturbances affecting both Syrania and the Material Plane, entrusts them with a mission to restore balance, hinting at a personal request from Verity's father.

 - [ ]  **The Elemental Airships**

En route to Aeon's last known location, the party encounters a convoy of elemental airships manned by Syranian guardians. They must either evade, outmaneuver, or diplomatically navigate past these ships, showcasing their intentions and newfound aerial abilities.

##### 2: The Test of Trust

 - [ ]  **The Garden of Whispers**

A serene garden suspended in the sky, where the party's truths and secrets are echoed by the wind. They must navigate the garden, facing personal trials that challenge their trust in each other and their resolve.

 - [ ]  **The Cloud Maze**

A maze constructed from dense, ever-shifting clouds. Flight is key, but so is clever navigation, as the maze conceals both pitfalls and clues to Aeon's condition.

##### 3: Aeon's Reflection

 - [ ]  **The Hall of Reflections**

A hall within a grand citadel, filled with mirrors that do not reflect reality but possibilities and past choices. The party must find the mirror that reveals the source of Aeon's corruption.

Valmoc's reflection is also revealed to be that of a platinum dragon.

 - [ ]  **The Chamber of Chains**

Discovering Aeon bound and influenced by magical chains that are siphoning his essence, possibly connected to draconic magic. The party must confront the guardians of this chamber, embodiments of Aeon's twisted desires and fears.

##### 4: The Sky Battle

 - [ ]  **The Assault on the Sky Fortress**

The party, along with Aeon, must escape the citadel, leading to a confrontation with the forces that seek to keep Aeon under control. This sky battle tests the party's combat abilities, strategy, and mastery of flight in a dynamic environment.

 - [ ]  **The Eye of the Storm**

Amidst a tumultuous storm, possibly conjured by Aeon's unchecked power, the party faces a draconic emissary responsible for the corruption. This battle, high above Syrania, requires clever use of the environment, flight, and the tempest itself to prevail.

##### 5: Aeon's Redemption

 - [ ]  **The Spires of Dawn**

With Aeon free from influence, they arrive at a sacred site in Syrania. Aeon confronts the consequences of his actions, offering a heartfelt reunion with Verity and imparting celestial wisdom that ties back to the central narrative, revealing a part of the draconic plot that threatens the planes.

 - [ ]  **The Silver Dragon's Legacy**

Valmoc reveals his true purpose for sending the party: to not only save Aeon but also to retrieve an artifact from the Eye of the Storm, essential for combating the draconic threat across the planes. This artifact, linked to Syrania's core, highlights the importance of balance and unity in facing the challenges ahead.

Valmoc hands over a Platinum Scarf to the party.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Use Valmoc to get the party to Arcanix, where he went to recently when he left the group to see his old friend Professor Stone. The Professor has discovered a powerful arcane signature coming from the plane of Syrania, via the Gate of Xabra that he maintains.
* When they get there, have Valmoc fly off to The University, where he will be studying as much arcane knowledge as possible to pass on to Yllosavax.
* Verity should be confronted by the merchant she stole from in the Market, and asked to pay up. Since she's likely not willing to hand over a soul, the merchant offers an alternative - to retrieve some rare merchandise from a place known as the Undercloud. If she doesn't agree, then the merchant threatens to turn her over to her father.
	* One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage.
* Otherwise, focus on social encounters and maybe political intrigue here.
* Also adapt "The Price of Beauty" from Candlekeep Mysteries (pg 75)
