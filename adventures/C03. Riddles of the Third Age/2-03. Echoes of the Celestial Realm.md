### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Use Valmoc to get the party to Arcanix, where he went to recently when he left the group to see his old friend Professor Stone. The Professor has discovered a powerful arcane signature coming from the plane of Syrania, via the Gate of Xabra that he maintains.
* When they get there, have Valmoc fly off to The University, where he will be studying as much arcane knowledge as possible to pass on to Yllosavax.
* Verity should be confronted by the merchant she stole from in the Market, and asked to pay up. Since she's likely not willing to hand over a soul, the merchant offers an alternative - to retrieve some rare merchandise from a place known as the Undercloud. If she doesn't agree, then the merchant threatens to turn her over to her father.
	* One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage.
* Otherwise, focus on social encounters and maybe political intrigue here.
* Also adapt "The Price of Beauty" from Candlekeep Mysteries (pg 75)
