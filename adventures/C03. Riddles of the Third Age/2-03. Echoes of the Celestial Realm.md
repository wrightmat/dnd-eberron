### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Gate of Xabra

 - [ ]  **Arcanix and the Observatory**

The adventure begins in Arcanix, where Windsor, leveraging his scholarly knowledge, aids the party in activating the Gate of Xabra. Valmoc, aware of celestial disturbances affecting both Syrania and the Material Plane, entrusts them with a mission to restore balance. Valmoc knows Professor Stone personally, as he has spent time in Arcanix doing work for the Silver Scales (in fact he went there when after leaving the party last time when they went to Sarlona).

Valmoc should direct the party to the school, and then toward Professor Windsor Stone. The players of course may explore any areas of Arcanix, including the village or the school itself.

 - [ ]  **The Plane of Syrania**

>Professor Stone uses a finger to trace a certain series of glyphs on the stones, which glow slightly as east is completed. When all the glyphs have been traced, everything within the Gate of Xabra disappears with a whoosh of air. In the next instance, you find yourself floating among the clouds.

Behind the players is a perfectly circular cloud that serves as a glowing portal back to the Gate of Xabra in Eberron. In front of them is Elyriel, who serves as the angelic guardian of temporary gates from Eberron (such as the Gate of Xabra). She is friendly to the players (and unfamiliar with Verity, since she's fairly new to the job), and directs them if they want to go anywhere, suggesting they at least visit the planes-famous Immeasurable Market.

If needing to move the story forward, any conversation can interrupted by a merchant from the Immeasurable Market arriving to challenge Verity.

##### 2: The Slighted Merchant

 - [ ]  **The Immeasurable Market**

When the players approach the Immeasurable Market, a merchant quickly approaches the group and confronts Verity. This confrontation can also occur when they arrive at the plane if they decide to try going somewhere other than the Immeasurable Market. The merchant, a female aasimar named Miraela, is the one who Verity stole their mother's cure from. She is adamant that Verity owes her payment, and that she must hand over a soul or be reported to both Castiel and her father.

But Miraela is fair, and she would allow Verity to retrieve a few rare items from a rarely visited place called the Undercloud instead. One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage, that would cover the payment. The other item is something for Miraela's personal collection, a book which features a magical mirror on the front.

>An aasimar woman flies hurriedly toward you, and fixes her deep azure eyes on Verity, her expression serene yet unmistakably firm. She speaks in a clear, calm voice, "Verity, it has been some time since our last encounter. I see the paths you've chosen have led you back. Let us speak of past deeds and their weight on the present, shall we?"
>She turns toward the rest of you. "I am Miraela Thespir, a steward of rare and powerful potions and poisons. They and I have met before, under less forthright circumstances involving a certain invaluable cure they once acquired without transaction." Her tone softens slightly, addressing everyone in the group, "I propose an opportunity to balance our accounts. Venture into the Undercloud to retrieve two items: a golden lotus flower, which holds the soul of an enlightened mortal sage, and a book adorned with a magical mirror. These will settle your debt and perhaps, restore a bit of harmony to our relations."

 - [ ]  **The Undercloud**

The party needs to move silently through the drifting motes of earth or cloud, avoiding detection by the guardians of these artifacts, mist dancers known as Bereginyas. The party may use environmental elements or illusion spells to create distractions, drawing guardians away from the items they seek.

`encounter: 1: Bereginyas`

Once the book adorned with a magical mirror is collected, it speaks to anyone who observes it, and especially looks into the mirror.

> [!info] Book Description
> The Price of Beauty is bound in soft green leather, eight inches wide and fourteen inches tall, and set with golden clasps. The book gives off the unmistakable scent of lilies. Set into its cover is a polished oval mirror with a delicate gold frame styled like locks of hair, which appear to spill down around the face of anyone who looks into the mirror. The book is filled with beautiful illustrations of woodland scenes, art, and jewelry. Delicate handwriting accompanies the illustrations, in the form of short prayers and meditations dedicated to seeking self-worth, techniques for massage and healing, and recipes for creating balms and cosmetics.
On the last page is an inscription by the author,
Sylvarie Silversong, which reads: "A mirror is
a gateway to happiness, truth, and to accepting
ourselves."

When the players return to Arcanix, they should somehow be introduced to Empress [[Corrine ir'Wyrnarn]], and the conflict brewing between the green dragons of the Eldeen Reaches (allied with Corrine) and the gold dragons of Thrane, with Aundair being the middle ground that's sturing up the conflict. Maybe the Empress is visiting the University for some reason?

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Use Valmoc to get the party to Arcanix, where he went to recently when he left the group to see his old friend Professor Stone. The Professor has discovered a powerful arcane signature coming from the plane of Syrania, via the Gate of Xabra that he maintains.
* When they get there, have Valmoc fly off to The University, where he will be studying as much arcane knowledge as possible to pass on to Yllosavax.
* Verity should be confronted by the merchant she stole from in the Market, and asked to pay up. Since she's likely not willing to hand over a soul, the merchant offers an alternative - to retrieve some rare merchandise from a place known as the Undercloud. If she doesn't agree, then the merchant threatens to turn her over to her father.
	* One item is a golden lotus flower, which contains the soul of an enlightened mortal sage.
* Otherwise, focus on social encounters and maybe political intrigue here.
* Also adapt "The Price of Beauty" from Candlekeep Mysteries (pg 75)
