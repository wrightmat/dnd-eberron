### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Elyon's Challenge

 - [ ]  **The Jungle's Edge**

The players navigate the dense, shadowy outskirts of the Moonsword Jungle, encountering natural obstacles and signs of the jungle's magical nature. Their path leads to the temple's hidden entrance, guarded by Elyon.

Two DC 15 Survival checks will lead the party out of the jungle, with any failures resulting in a random encounter from the table below.

 - [ ]  **Elyon's Test**

Thana's uncle, Elyon, emerges as the temple's guardian. Recognizing Thana, he challenges the party to a combat test to prove they are ready to face the temple's dangers and worthy of the Moonblade's legacy. Elyon uses non-lethal tactics, aiming to test rather than harm.

##### 2: Central Chamber

The temple is circular, and composed of a large central chamber shaped like a full moon surrounded by an outer chamber which is composed of two half moon chambers on either side and a larger square chamber to the north. In the center of the large central chamber is a still fountain (the Moon Font). The chamber to the north contains an altar, and is the site of the final battle with the temple's guardian - a Young Moonstone Dragon.

>As you step into an expansive chamber, your gaze is drawn to a serene stone pool at its heart, illuminated by a shaft of moonlight from above. Surrounding the pool, twelve large, ornately carved tiles rest on the edge, each depicting a moon of a different size and color. Radiating from the Moon Font are twelve short hallways, like spokes on a wheel, and at the end of each, an alcove in the floor stands empty, awaiting something to fill it.

 - [ ]  **The Moon Font**

A large circular still fountain is the central feature of this large chamber.  Anyone drinking from the font transforms into a random lycanthrope until the next dark of the moon. 1) Wolf, 2) Boar, 3) Rat, 4) Stag, 5) Bear, 6) Spider.

A dozen large tiles are placed on the perimeter of the font, each depicting a moon of a different size and color.

 - [ ]  **Moon Tile Puzzle**

Twelve short hallways radiate out from the central chamber, each terminating with an empty alcove on the floor, which could hold something like a large tile. The twelve tiles on the font need to be placed in the alcoves, but in the correct order, with Zarantyr being placed in the north alcove and the moons radiating in order around the room from there.

When the tiles are placed in the correct order, two doors open on each end of the chamber (at 3:00 and 9:00) leading to the Outer Chambers.

##### 3: Outer Chambers

 - [ ]  **Whispered Secrets**

The players enter a hall where their movements and spells echo unnaturally.

Allude to Moonstone Dragon fight later, and subduing it rather than killing it.

The players enter a grove within the temple, where shadows move with a life of their own. Light from the moon filters through the foliage in strange patterns, creating paths that seem to shift when not observed directly.

The trees in the grove whisper secrets in ancient Elvish, offering clues to navigate the shifting paths. However, some whispers seek to mislead or confuse. Players must discern which whispers to trust to find the way through.

Insight checks to discern which whispers are telling the truth and which are lying?

 - [ ]  **The Moonlit Garden**

Emerging from the shadows, the players find themselves in a moonlit clearing, with a large, intricate puzzle that covers the ground. The puzzle pieces are enchanted tiles that glow under the moonlight, depicting phases of the moon and ancient elven symbols.

As they attempt to solve the puzzle, spirit guardians of the temple, manifestations of lunar energy, emerge from the tiles. These spirits pose riddles related to the moon, the stars, and elven history, challenging the playersâ€™ wisdom and knowledge.

The puzzle involves aligning the lunar phases in the correct sequence to reflect a specific lunar cycle significant to Thana's ancestors and the Moonblade's history. Could be difficult and interesting because of the many moons of Eberron. Maybe the sequence is what the moons looked like on the day of Thana's birth?

>As you enter the chamber, your eyes are immediately drawn to the floor, which is segmented into twelve large, stone tiles, each carved with the intricate symbol of one of Eberron's moons. The tiles are set within a network of tracks, suggesting they can be moved. Along the walls, astrological charts and faded texts depict the lunar cycles and their celestial dance across the sky. In the room's center, a small pedestal cradles a dusty, crystalline orb which seems to pulsate with a dim, internal light.

##### 4: The Moonlit Sanctum

 - [ ]  **The Guardian Beasts**

In the sanctum, the players face the temple's strongest protectors: a Lunarian and its Moonkite allies, under the bewitching light of a Living Moonbeam. This battle tests their strategy, resilience, and ability to work as a team.

 - [ ]  **The Moonstone Dragon**

As the final guardian, a Young Moonstone Dragon, influenced by the temple's magic, challenges the players. Victory requires them to subdue the dragon without destroying it, proving their worthiness to wield the Moonblade.

##### 5: The Moonblade's Legacy

 - [ ]  **The Blade's Awakening**

Upon defeating the guardians, the Moonblade reveals itself, resonating with Thana's presence. As she approaches, it awakens, and her parents' spirits communicate through it, offering blessings, revealing hidden truths about her heritage, and the blade's powers.

 - [ ]  **A New Guardian**

With the Moonblade in hand, Thana experiences a vision of the temple's past protectors, including a forewarning of a looming threat that seeks the blade's power. The spirits of her parents bestow upon her the role of the new guardian, hinting at future adventures and responsibilities.

 - [ ]  **Plot Twist**

As the players leave the temple, Elyon re-appears and challenges the party again. But this time for real. He believes that Thana is not actually worthy to wield the Moonblade (and only helped so she could get it for him), as she is now full of evil and a threat to the family's legacy.
