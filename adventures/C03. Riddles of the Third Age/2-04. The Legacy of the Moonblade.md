### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Elyon's Challenge

 - [ ]  **The Jungle's Edge**

The players navigate the dense, shadowy outskirts of the Moonsword Jungle, encountering natural obstacles and signs of the jungle's magical nature. Their path leads to the temple's hidden entrance, guarded by Elyon.

Random table and Survival checks.

 - [ ]  **Elyon's Test**

Thana's uncle, Elyon, emerges as the guardian. Recognizing Thana, he challenges the party to a combat test to prove they are ready to face the temple's dangers and worthy of the Moonblade's legacy. Elyon uses non-lethal tactics, aiming to test rather than harm.

##### 2: The Hall of Echoes

 - [ ]  **Echoes of the Past**

Inside the temple, the players enter a hall where their movements and spells echo unnaturally. To progress, they must solve a puzzle that involves replicating specific patterns or sequences reflective of the Moonblade's history and Thana's heritage.

 - [ ]  **Whispered Secrets**

Successfully solving the puzzle calms the echoes, allowing the players to hear whispered messages from Thana's parents, offering cryptic advice and encouragement for the trials ahead.

Allude to Moonstone Dragon fight later, and subduing it rather than killing it.

##### 3: The Trials of Moonlight and Shadow

 - [ ]  **The Grove of Whispering Shadows**

The players enter a grove within the temple, where shadows move with a life of their own. Light from the moon filters through the foliage in strange patterns, creating paths that seem to shift when not observed directly.

The trees in the grove whisper secrets in ancient Elvish, offering clues to navigate the shifting paths. However, some whispers seek to mislead or confuse. Players must discern which whispers to trust to find the way through.

Insight checks to discern which whispers are telling the truth and which are lying?

 - [ ]  **The Moonlit Clearing**

Emerging from the shadows, the players find themselves in a moonlit clearing, with a large, intricate puzzle that covers the ground. The puzzle pieces are enchanted tiles that glow under the moonlight, depicting phases of the moon and ancient elven symbols.

As they attempt to solve the puzzle, spirit guardians of the temple, manifestations of lunar energy, emerge from the tiles. These spirits pose riddles related to the moon, the stars, and elven history, challenging the playersâ€™ wisdom and knowledge.

The puzzle involves aligning the lunar phases in the correct sequence to reflect a specific lunar cycle significant to Thana's ancestors and the Moonblade's history. Could be difficult and interesting because of the many moons of Eberron. Maybe the sequence is what the moons looked like on the day of Thana's birth?

##### 4: The Moonlit Sanctum

 - [ ]  **The Guardian Beasts**

In the sanctum, the players face the temple's strongest protectors: a Lunarian and its Moonkite allies, under the bewitching light of a Living Moonbeam. This battle tests their strategy, resilience, and ability to work as a team.

 - [ ]  **The Moonstone Dragon**

As the final guardian, a Young Moonstone Dragon, influenced by the temple's magic, challenges the players. Victory requires them to subdue the dragon without destroying it, proving their worthiness to wield the Moonblade.

##### 5: The Moonblade's Legacy

 - [ ]  **The Blade's Awakening**

Upon defeating the guardians, the Moonblade reveals itself, resonating with Thana's presence. As she approaches, it awakens, and her parents' spirits communicate through it, offering blessings, revealing hidden truths about her heritage, and the blade's powers.

 - [ ]  **A New Guardian**

With the Moonblade in hand, Thana experiences a vision of the temple's past protectors, including a forewarning of a looming threat that seeks the blade's power. The spirits of her parents bestow upon her the role of the new guardian, hinting at future adventures and responsibilities.

 - [ ]  **Plot Twist**

As the players leave the temple, Elyon re-appears and challenges the party again. But this time for real. He believes that Thana is not actually worthy to wield the Moonblade (and only helped so she could get it for him), as she is now full of evil and a threat to the family's legacy.
