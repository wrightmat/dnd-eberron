### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **[[Regalport]]** (nearby capital city)

* This is the capital of the Principalities, with just about any product available that's related to the sea or shipping. It's also one of the few places that's familiar with the details of Sarlona.

* **High Prince's Estate**. Home of High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn.
* **Pirate Exchange**. This exchange boasts a variety of merchants selling goods from across the continent of Khorvaire, as well as local catches of seafood and treasures found around the islands that make up the Principalities. The exchange is one of the few places that regularly stocks items from Argonnessen and Sarlona.
* **Seadragon Seaport**. 

 - [ ]  **Approaching Ninebay Island**

* Ninebay Island is a large manifest zone to Syrania, which results in strange sudden winds, changes in gravity, and other effects that will impact the PCs. The lair of the sphinx is actually in the clouds above Ninebay Island, where they PCs can eventually arrive if they can survive the challenges.

 - [ ]  **Climbing to the Clouds**

* Clouds begin to swirl beneath the players' feet as they walk across the island, and they eventually start to coalesce into small platforms that move them upward. Players must traverse the cloud platforms using Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, as the clouds shift beneath their feet. Failure may lead to a fall through the clouds, requiring a quick reaction, or fall damage. This takes the form of a skill challenge where four successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) must be completed before two failures. Each challenge takes place twenty feet above the last one.

 - [ ]  **Whirlwind Nexus**

* A central platform is surrounded by swirling vortexes of wind. Four elemental creatures, each representing a cardinal wind, guard the path forward. The steam mephit represents the hot south wind (red), the xx represents the cold north wind (blue), the xx represents the east dry wind (yellow), and the xx represents the gentle west wind (green). When each is defeated, it leaves behind a colored gem that's used later in the adventure. The platform is 100 feet above the ground.

 - [ ]  **Skyward Sentries**

* A series of floating platforms lead to a guarded chamber ahead. Aerial sentries, winged constructs with razor-sharp feathers, patrol the area. A DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check is necessary to sneak by the sentries, with any failures resulting in them being alerted to that players' presence.
* At the center of the room, a magical chest awaits (containing the [[Wings of Flying]]). These platforms are 200 feet above the ground.

 - [ ]  ??? Social encounter?

* This guarded chamber is 300 feet above the ground.

 - [ ]  ???

* This area is 400 feet above the ground.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Swift Guardian**

* This chamber is 600 feet above the ground.

 - [ ]  **OPTIONAL: Speartip Island**

* Something like this could be a fun sidequest, if the players want to explore the Principalities: https://www.worldanvil.com/w/eberron-23myeberron-artorias1x/a/speartip-location
