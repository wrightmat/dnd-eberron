### DM Notes and Random Tables

* The Pit of Five Sorrows is a chasm in Argonnessen that is the prison for the Overlord Tiamat, the Daughter of Khyber. The chasm is heavily guarded by the forces of the Light of Siberys.
	* Should set up the Pit of Five Sorrows as a front between the topaz dragons (led by Loredrake Arstyvrax) and the Light of Siberys (led by LightkeeperÂ Dolarashynach).
	* Also work in the Talons of Tiamat somewhere. Likely as a foil to the Light of Siberys to explain why they haven't already squashed the topaz dragons and their plan.
* Final adventure where the players confront the topaz dragons and try to prevent their ritual to release Tiamat. Mechanics should really lean into the idea of order versus chaos.
* Monsters: Gem Stalker (FtoD), Andrenjinyi (ToB1), Haugbui (ToB1), Gray Render (CR 12, MotM), Displacer Beast (CR 3, MM), Umber Hulk (CR 5, MM), Venom Troll (CR 7, MotM), dinosaurs, dire animals, and all types of dragons.
