 - [ ]  The Abyss of Fear

* The final challenge lies in a vast chamber shrouded in magical darkness (so artificial light sources don't work, but darkvision does). This area tests the players' courage in the face of their deepest fears, with unseen adversaries lurking in the shadows. Immediately have PCs roll initiative. On each turn, roll a d4, with a 1 resulting in a shadow finding that character (see below). PCs can do anything they would like (as usual) in addition to the below options:
	* PCs who cannot see may make a DC 10 Perception check to ascertain the location of any shadows. Failure results in one of the shadows finding that character.
	* Any PC may make a DC 12 Survival check (at disadvantage if they can't see) to attempt to find the exit. Three successful (non-sequential) checks are needed to find it.
* When a shadow finds a PC, they must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they become overwhelmed with fear and must describe one of their character's fears.
