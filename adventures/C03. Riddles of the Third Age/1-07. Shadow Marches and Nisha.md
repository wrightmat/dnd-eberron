### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Patrahk'n** (nearby town)

Patrahk'n is a relatively small orc town, which is arranged in a circle surrounding the central Competition RIng. The House Tharashk Enclave and its attached buildings make up the west side of the surrounding circle, while 'Aashta Alchemy, Farghed's Fishery, and a row of merchant's tents make up the east side of the circle. Outside of those are the huts that serve as residences for the citizens. 

* **Competition Ring**. Where the citizens, mostly led by the â€˜Aashta, hold fighting contests.
* **House Tharashk Enclave**. Headquarters of the House Tharashk endeavors in the region, including a desk for the Finder's Guild. This building is also connected to The Valshar'ak Seal Hall and Dragonne's Roar below.
* **The Valshar'ak Seal Hall**. Meeting hall of a secret society within House Tharashk composed of members of the Gatekeepers druid sect. They seek to channel Tharashk resources to further their goals of fighting back the Dragon Below.
* **Dragonne's Roar**. Runs a service where you can employ monsters (with price based on CR).
* **'Aashta Alchemy**. A magical shop dedicated to the daelkyr Kyrzin.
* **Farghed's Fishery**. A dock and fishery on the coast of Blackwater Lake.

 - [ ]  **Finding the Veiled Cave**

* 

 - [ ]  **Veiled Cave Entrance**

* The entrance of the Veiled Cave opens into an expansive cavern swallowed by shadows. A barely discernible inscription on the gate hints at the challenges within. The silence is palpable, and a soft breeze carries whispers that heighten the senses.
* Players with a passive Intelligence (Arcana) above 15 instinctively decipher the inscription, activating the gate and gaining entrance.

 - [ ]  **Stygian Crossing** (Acrobatics)

* The tunnel branches into darkness. The echoes of unseen creatures reverberate, and the paths appear uneven and meandering. The sound of distant water droplets is the only constant.
* Characters with a passive Dexterity (Acrobatics) above 14 skillfully navigate the paths without stumbling or veering off course. Those who choose can attempt an active check at the same DC, with failure resulting in the player getting lost and separated from the rest of the party. Any of these PCs are found in the next chamber, already engulfed by a darkmantle.

 - [ ]  **Darkmantle Chamber** (Perception)

* This chamber has dim light rather than entirely shadow like the other chambers, with pockets of shadow over stalactites where darkmantles (one per PC or 1d6) hang in wait.
* The darkmantles each make a Stealth check, compared to every players' passive Perception, with any scores exceeding that stealth roll revealing that darkmantles' presence, essentially giving that player a surprise round (but the player only see it as a stalactite engulfed in shadow). If a darkmantle is attacked, it starts by using it's Crush ability and falling on the player that attacked it.
   `encounter: 1d6: Darkmantle`

 - [ ]  **Mushrooms of Mayhem** (Animal Handling and Nature)

* This smaller chamber is full of bioluminescent mushrooms. Anyone with a passive Nature of 15 or greater recognizes that these would be very bad to eat. But anyone with a score lower than that hears the mushrooms calling out to them to eat them. A successful DC 15 Wisdom save allows the PC to not give in to the calls, but anyone failing must eat at least one mushroom (and can repeat the save as many times as needed, with each subsequent failure requiring that a new mushroom be eaten). Anyone ingesting a mushroom takes `dice:2d8` acid damage.
* Small hampster-like creatures are chowing down on the mushrooms. They're drawn to anyone with a passive Animal Handing of 12 or greater.

 - [ ]  **The Abyss of Fear** (Stealth)

* The next challenge lies in a vast chamber shrouded in magical darkness (so artificial light sources don't work, but darkvision does). This area tests the players' courage in the face of their deepest fears, with unseen adversaries lurking in the shadows. Immediately have PCs roll initiative. On each monster turn, roll a Perception check for them, compared to the players' passive Stealth, with any successes resulting in a shadow finding that character (see below). PCs can do anything they would like (as usual) in addition to the below things happening:
	* Based on the player's passive Perception, they know the location of a number of shadows that are closest to them (12+: 1, 15: 2, 18+: 3). The player may also choose to make an active check as their action.
	* If the player can see, and has a passive Survival of 12 or greater, then they get closer to the exit. The player may also choose to make an active check as their action (done at disadvantage if they can't see). Three successful (non-sequential) checks are needed to successfully find the exit.
* When a shadow finds a PC, they must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw (or automatically succeed with a passive Charisma of 12 or greater). On a failure, they become overwhelmed with fear and must describe one of their character's fears (or become frightened and lose any progress toward the exit).
`encounter: 1d6: Shadow`

 - [ ]  **The Cliff Face** (Athletics)

* This sheer cliff face leads to the final chamber, but is draped in complete darkness.
* Any player with a passive Strength (Athletics) of 12 or greater can find their way up the cliff face even without being able to see. Anyone else may make an active check (done at disadvantage if they can't see), managing to stumble their way up the wall on a success.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Primal Guardian**

* Nisha should reward the PCs with the Black Dragon Mask, and fill in any lore about ???

>"In the embrace of shadows, one discovers the true depth of their abilities. Your skills has been tested, and you have done well to find this place. I am at your service," he says, bowing deeply.
