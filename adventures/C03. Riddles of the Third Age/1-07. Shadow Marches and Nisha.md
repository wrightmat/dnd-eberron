The House Tharashk Enclave and its attached buildings make up the west side of the surrounding circle, while 'Aashta Alchemy, Farghed's Fishery, and a row of merchant's tents make up the east side of the circle. Outside of those are the huts that serve as residences for the citizens. 

* **Competition Ring**. Where the citizens, mostly led by the ‘Aashta, hold fighting (gladiatorial) contests.

 - [ ]  **Gladiatorial Competition**

[[Gladiator Combat]]

* **Phase 1: Introduce the Announcer and the Ring.**

	* First and foremost, the PCs should come up with a name for their team. The other team will always be called.... and be composed of random orc and half-orc barbarians and fighters.
	* The Announcer is a boisterous male tiefling known as Ralthor the Reveler. The intent is for him to be charismatic, a little bit shady, but most of all memorable - including casting thaumaturgy to rally the crowd for any kind of bloodshed that may occur. He should introduce both teams of competitors (using the quotes below) and interject commentary throughout the contest (using any of the quotes in the Combat section).
	* The Ring is composed of an outer ring of 100 foot diameter, with an inner ring of 80 foot diameter. The space between the inner and outer rings is rough stone that constitutes difficult terrain, and 10 foot tall by 10 foot wide stone plinths dot the perimeter, giving full cover to anyone standing behind them (who would be in difficult terrain, resulting in half speed to move in or through). The inner ring is smooth gravel, but completely open with nowhere to hide.

> "Ladies and gentlemen, fiends and fiesties, welcome to the grand spectacle! I am your host, the one and only Ralthor the Reveler, here to guide you through a night of unfettered excitement!"

> In this corner, we have the epitome of raw power and unmatched skill! Prepare to be dazzled by the indomitable might of (Team Name)!"

> "And now, emerging from the shadows, like specters of vengeance, let us welcome our first contenders! Brace yourselves for the thunderous applause as I present to you... (Team Name)!"

>[!info]- Total Cover
>A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

* **Phase 2: Before Combat**. Before rolling for initiative, give the players one round to entertain the crowd. Let each player roll a Charisma (Performance) check with DCs equivalent to the "Stoke the Crowd" action, gaining the appropriate amount of Crowd Favor based on the roll.

	* If the result is 10 – 14, the player gains 1d6 Crowd Favor points.
	* If the result is 15 – 19, the player gains 2d6 Crowd Favor points.
	* If the result is 20 – 24, the player gains 4d6 Crowd Favor points.
	* If the result is 25+, the player gains 6d6 Crowd Favor points.

* Phase 3: Combat
	* 

Shahiri (Hellish Rebuke):
>"By the infernal flames, that was a move that'll be talked about for ages to come! Let us all bask in the glory of this moment!"

Aither:
>"Oho! Did you see that? A strike as swift as the wind, my friends! The crowd goes wild for such displays of prowess!"

Verity (Sneak Attack):
>"Bravo! Bravo! Such finesse, such grace in the face of adversity! Let us shower our heroes with adulation!"

Critical Hit:
>"Oh-ho! That's going to leave a mark! But fear not, my friends, for our resilient combatants thrive on the thrill of battle!"

Critical Miss:
>"Ah, a misstep perhaps? But do not despair, dear spectators, for fortune favors the bold!"

Thamaturgy Effects:
>"By the booming voice of thunder, let the earth tremble beneath your feet, my friends! Cheer for your champions as their valor shakes the very foundations of this arena!"

>"Gaze upon the shimmering lights that dance in the air, a kaleidoscope of colors to honor our gallant combatants! Let the brilliance of their deeds illuminate the darkness of this night!"

>"Witness the ground beneath your feet tremble and quake with anticipation! Let the rumbling roar of thunderous applause herald the triumph of our champions!"

>"With a flourish of magic, I command the winds to carry your fervent cheers to the farthest reaches of Khorvaire!"

General:
>"Rise, my friends, rise! Let your voices be heard, let the very stones tremble beneath your thunderous applause!"

>"Aha! The fervor of the crowd ignites the very air with anticipation! Raise your banners high, let your cheers resound throughout the Marches!"

* Phase 4: Post-Combat
	* 

>"As the dust settles and the echoes of battle fade into the night, let us carry with us the indomitable spirit of camaraderie and competition! Farewell, my friends, until we meet again!"

 - [ ]  **Finding the Veiled Cave**

* 

 - [ ]  **Veiled Cave Entrance**

* The entrance of the Veiled Cave opens into an expansive cavern swallowed by shadows. A barely discernible inscription on the gate hints at the challenges within. The silence is palpable, and a soft breeze carries whispers that heighten the senses.
* Players with a passive Intelligence (Arcana) above 15 instinctively decipher the inscription, activating the gate and gaining entrance.

 - [ ]  **Stygian Crossing** (Acrobatics)

* The tunnel branches into darkness. The echoes of unseen creatures reverberate, and the paths appear uneven and meandering. The sound of distant water droplets is the only constant.
* Characters with a passive Dexterity (Acrobatics) above 14 skillfully navigate the paths without stumbling or veering off course. Those who choose can attempt an active check at the same DC, with failure resulting in the player getting lost and separated from the rest of the party. Any of these PCs are found in the next chamber, already engulfed by a darkmantle.

 - [ ]  **Darkmantle Chamber** (Perception)

* This chamber has dim light rather than entirely shadow like the other chambers, with pockets of shadow over stalactites where darkmantles (one per PC or 1d6) hang in wait.
* The darkmantles each make a Stealth check, compared to every players' passive Perception, with any scores exceeding that stealth roll revealing that darkmantles' presence, essentially giving that player a surprise round (but the player only see it as a stalactite engulfed in shadow). If a darkmantle is attacked, it starts by using it's Crush ability and falling on the player that attacked it.
   `encounter: 1d6: Darkmantle`

 - [ ]  **Mushrooms of Mayhem** (Animal Handling and Nature)

* This smaller chamber is full of bioluminescent mushrooms. Anyone with a passive Nature of 15 or greater recognizes that these would be very bad to eat. But anyone with a score lower than that hears the mushrooms calling out to them to eat them. A successful DC 15 Wisdom save allows the PC to not give in to the calls, but anyone failing must eat at least one mushroom (and can repeat the save as many times as needed, with each subsequent failure requiring that a new mushroom be eaten). Anyone ingesting a mushroom takes `dice:2d8` acid damage.
* Two giant frogs are chowing down on the mushrooms. They're drawn to anyone with a passive Animal Handing of 12 or greater, but won't attack (are completely friendly unless attacked).

 - [ ]  **The Abyss of Fear** (Stealth)

* The next challenge lies in a vast chamber shrouded in magical darkness (so artificial light sources don't work, but darkvision does). This area tests the players' courage in the face of their deepest fears, with unseen adversaries lurking in the shadows. Immediately have PCs roll initiative. On each monster turn, roll a Perception check for them, compared to the players' passive Stealth, with any successes resulting in a shadow finding that character (see below). PCs can do anything they would like (as usual) in addition to the below things happening:
	* Based on the player's passive Perception, they know the location of a number of shadows that are closest to them (12+: 1, 15: 2, 18+: 3). The player may also choose to make an active check as their action.
	* If the player can see, and has a passive Survival of 12 or greater, then they get closer to the exit. The player may also choose to make an active check as their action (done at disadvantage if they can't see). Three successful (non-sequential) checks are needed to successfully find the exit.
* When a shadow finds a PC, they must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw (or automatically succeed with a passive Charisma of 12 or greater). On a failure, they become overwhelmed with fear and must describe one of their character's fears (or become frightened and lose any progress toward the exit).
`encounter: 1d6: Shadow`

 - [ ]  **The Cliff Face** (Athletics)

* This sheer cliff face leads to the final chamber, but is draped in complete darkness.
* Any player with a passive Strength (Athletics) of 12 or greater can find their way up the cliff face even without being able to see. Anyone else may make an active check (done at disadvantage if they can't see), managing to stumble their way up the wall on a success.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Primal Guardian**

* Nisha should reward the PCs with the Black Dragon Mask, and fill in any lore about ???

>"In the embrace of shadows, one discovers the true depth of their abilities. Your skills has been tested, and you have done well to find this place. I am at your service," he says, bowing deeply.
