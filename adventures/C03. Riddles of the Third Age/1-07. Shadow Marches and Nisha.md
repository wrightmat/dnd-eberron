### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Some village?



 - [ ]  **Finding Vvaraak's Cave**

* 

 - [ ]  **Veiled Cave Entrance**

* The entrance to Vvaraak's Cave opens into an expansive cavern swallowed by shadows. A barely discernible inscription on the gate hints at the challenges within. The silence is palpable, and a soft breeze carries whispers that heighten the senses.
* Players with a passive Intelligence (Arcana) above 15 instinctively decipher the inscription, activating the gate and gaining entrance.

 - [ ]  **Stygian Crossing**

* The tunnel branches into darkness. The echoes of unseen creatures reverberate, and the paths appear uneven and meandering. The sound of distant water droplets is the only constant.
* Characters with a passive Dexterity (Acrobatics) above 14 skillfully navigate the paths without stumbling or veering off course. Those who choose can attempt an active check at the same DC, with failure resulting in the player getting lost and separated from the rest of the party.

 - [ ]  **The Abyss of Fear**

* The final challenge lies in a vast chamber shrouded in magical darkness (so artificial light sources don't work, but darkvision does). This area tests the players' courage in the face of their deepest fears, with unseen adversaries lurking in the shadows. Immediately have PCs roll initiative. On each turn, roll a d4, with a 1 resulting in a shadow finding that character (see below). PCs can do anything they would like (as usual) in addition to the below options:
	* PCs who cannot see may make a DC 10 Perception check to ascertain the location of any shadows. Failure results in one of the shadows finding that character.
	* Any PC may make a DC 12 Survival check (at disadvantage if they can't see) to attempt to find the exit. Three successful (non-sequential) checks are needed to find it.
* When a shadow finds a PC, they must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they become overwhelmed with fear and must describe one of their character's fears.

* The Mystic Glade (see Dragons of Eberron, pg. 90-91) - use this somewhere? Could be a second chapter adventure, depending on what we do with that.
