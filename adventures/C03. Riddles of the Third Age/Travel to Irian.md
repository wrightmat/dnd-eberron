### Background and Hook(s)

* Irian connects to all of the characters in some way - the Undying Court for Thana, "the light" for Aither, and a possible new home and/or source of radiance for Verity as an Irian aasimar instead of Syranian. They are also already tied to Lorrister, who is an Irian aasimar.
* If the players die (especially a TPK, but could also work with a single death if we split the party for a short time), then they should see a bright light that they're drawn to. If they decide to move toward the light, then they can awake in Irian. If not all of the players die, then the one(s) who do could explore Irian for a short time by themselves, and then could follow shortly with the "Dragon Attack" story beat (see [[Future Adventure Concepts]]), drowning the rest of the characters in the process, where they see a bright white light underwater.

### Characters and Locations

* **Prince Lorrister**
* **Joy**
* **Honor**

* **Shining Valley, Breland**. A hidden valley in the Graywall Mountains of Breland, it is a strong Irian manifest zone. In the Shining Valley, the surrounding mountains are bathed in light, and even the darker hours are brighter here. The Haunting Song, a harpy flight, has made its home here, for they have refused to submit to the Daughters of Sora Kell.
* **[[Barrakas (Irian)]]**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Shining Valley**

- If we need a way to get the players to Irian that doesn't involve death, could find a way to direct them to Shining Valley. Possibly Verity senses their siblings' presence on the material plane somehow.
- After rebelling against their father (inspired by Verity), they've been exiled from Syrania as Radiant Idols, and sent to Sharn. They quickly left to explore the area and happened upon Shining Valley in Breland. There they allied with The Haunting Song, who they identified with because they were also considered monsters and didn't believe themselves to be so.

 - [ ]  **Adamantine City**

- 

 - [ ]  **Planar Seed of Shae Mordai**

- Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they’re small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they’re to become.  Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.
