### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes.
 - [ ]  The spiral symbol over Argonnessen on the map is an ancient symbol depicting one of the Overlords, Tiamat (also known as the daughter of Khyber).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* When they arrive, there's no one here, but there is a pedestal with a map engraved on it. If the players place their map on top, then the sphinx runes light up and create a holographic version of a younger Flamewind. A recording should direct them toward an ultimate weapon that can help them defeat the dragons (possibly something that allows them to join the masks together in some way - Megazord style). Taken from Sonic 2.
	* Also have the pedestal light up with new points when the map is removed, outlining the [[Future Adventure Concepts]] that are possible new locations for the PCs to visit.
* Maybe some sort of battle with Flamewind? Like a spectral version, or an evil doppelganger or something? At CR 11, could be a good stepping stone to the final battle.
* Should make heavy use of the Lantern of Seeking. Possibly embed several of the creature types as encounters in the dungeon, with the ability to bypass encounters and find multiple routes by using the lantern.
* Could do a fully gamified dungeon, where at some point the characters can look out over a maze from above. The same maze they've been navigating with the lantern.
