### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Entrance

* Concept is testing of all six ability scores. There are six statues in the entryway, each with an outstretched hand. The party will enter "test chambers" and solve a puzzle with one of those themes. At the end, they get an orb and put it in the appropriate statue's hand. So part of the test is identifying what they are being tested on.
* Giant (Constitution)
* Gnome (Wisdom)
* Undying Soldier (Intelligence)

 - [ ]  Constitution

* A yellow glass sphere about the size of a basketball covered with spike-like 'rays' resembling a sun floats above a stone altar. Inside is a dead butterfly (or dove, or whatever). Picking it up with ungloved hands causes the spikes to pierce the skin and blood flows into the spikes and down the insides of the sphere. Each round it is held and draws blood in this fashion, 1 Con pt. of blood is drained, and after 10 pts. of blood are drawn in this fashion, the butterfly returns to life, and the crystal globe shatters, freeing the revived insect, which then flutters to the mosaic on the far wall and lands on the tile that must be pressed to pass beyond this chamber. The blood drawn in this fashion need not come from a single individual, and it would obviously be better for a 5 man party to divide it up and each donate 2 Con pts. worth of blood than for any single member to contribute all 10 pts!

 - [ ]  Intelligence

* 

 - [ ]  Wisdom

* There's an orb visible under a large pile of rubble, with a small hole in it. Aither's rat could fit through the hole and retrieve it, requiring a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.
* Small rat-like creatures known as Musteval Guardinal (also introduced as a possible monster encounter in Reigney's lair) can be found moving in and out of the pile of rubble - animalistic Celestials that resemble Humanoids with bestial traits, and who embody the beauty, calm, and righteousness of their home plane.
* Maybe there's a trap or something?

 - [ ]  Charisma

* 

 - [ ]  Former Lair of the Oracular Guardian

* When they arrive, there's no one here, but there is a pedestal with a map engraved on it. If the players place their map on top, then the sphinx runes light up and create a holographic version of a younger Flamewind. A recording should direct them toward an ultimate weapon that can help them defeat the dragons (possibly something that allows them to join the masks together in some way - Megazord style). Taken from Sonic 2.
	* Also have the pedestal light up with new points when the map is removed, outlining the [[Future Adventure Concepts]] that are possible new locations for the PCs to visit.
* Maybe some sort of battle with Flamewind? Like a spectral version, or an evil doppelganger or something? At CR 11, could be a good stepping stone to the final battle.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes.
 - [ ]  The spiral symbol over Argonnessen on the map is an ancient symbol depicting one of the Overlords, Tiamat (also known as the daughter of Khyber).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Should make heavy use of the Lantern of Seeking. Possibly embed several of the creature types as encounters in the dungeon, with the ability to bypass encounters and find multiple routes by using the lantern.
* Could do a fully gamified dungeon, where at some point the characters can look out over a maze from above. The same maze they've been navigating with the lantern.
* Monsters: Bastet Temple Cat (ToB1, the Fascinating Lure action is just too fun for a group that loves cats), Millitaur (ToB1), Prismatic Beetle (ToB1)
