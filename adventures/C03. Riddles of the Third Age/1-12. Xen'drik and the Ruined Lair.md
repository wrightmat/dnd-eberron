### Background and Hook(s)

* Flamewind's lair has been mostly ruined with time. There is still information the players can glean though.
* Valmoc will know the location of Flamewind's former lair, and will direct the players that way after Flamewind is killed during the attack on Sharn (after Flamewind has also directed them there with her dying breath).

### Characters and Locations

* **Flamewind** (Gynosphinx)
* **Salkarath** (N male sahuagin). The bartender and owner of the Wavecrest Tavern. Salkarath stands out with his deep green scales, sharp teeth, and piercing yellow eyes, yet his demeanor is surprisingly amiable, at least to those who show him and his establishment respect. He keeps his tavern oddly clean and is known for serving a variety of exotic drinks, most of which incorporate ingredients only found in the depths of the ocean.
* **Valexa Von Ruthvek** (N female gnome magewright). Proprietor of Von Ruthvek's Splendors of the South in the Marketplace District.
* **Tarnik Graysail** (NG male human fighter). Once a renowned guide of Xen'drik's jungles, Tarnik now spends his days sharing tales over drinks at Molou's Distillery. His weather-beaten face and keen eyes speak of a life of adventure, and he's always ready to offer advice or a warning to those brave enough to explore the wilds he once navigated.

* **[[Stormreach]]**
* **Former Lair of the Oracular Guardian**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Attack on Morgrave University**

* As the party arrives at Morgrave University, the first thing they see is an Adult White Dragon using its breath weapon to attack the university, and specifically Lareth Hall. Valmoc is there, attempting to fight off the dragon.
* If the group (including Valmoc, as needed) can get the dragon down to half HP, then it flees by quickly flying north while continuing using its breath weapon to spew cold across Sharn.
	* At some point during the battle they should hear the dragon say, in Draconic, something like "Stay out of dragon business!"
* Inside Lareth Hall, the party will find Flamewind, mortally wounded. With her dying breath, she tells the group to seek out her former lair in Xen'drik (and that Valmoc knows the way). She then lays down without speaking, and begins to slowly fade away (just as Reigney did).
* If the players look around, they find that [[Valmoc]] has left the room, and is in the hallway totally silent. Use the opportunity to reveal more of his backstory, at least his connection to Flamewind.

`encounter: 1: Adult White Dragon`

 - [ ]  **[[Stormreach]]**

* **The Bazaar** (Marketplace District).
* **Molou's Distillery** (Marketplace District). A once-renowned guide, now retired in Stormreach, speaks of an unnatural fog that leads unwary travelers astray or to their doom but opens the path for those it deems worthy. Find your way through the fog, and you'll find something worthwhile, he says.
* **Von Ruthvek's Splendors of the South** (Marketplace District). A small, ancient idol recently unearthed whispers secrets of the jungle to those who listen closely, including the rumored location of an ancient sphinx lair.
* **Temple of the Sovereign Host** (Forgelight District).
* **Wavecrest Tavern** (Harbor District). A seedy half-underwater bar that tailors to sahuagin and other less-than-reputables. Sahuagin raiders have recently acquired a relic from the jungle's depths (a compass that can lead the players to Flamewind's former lair), not understanding its significance but recognizing its power. They're open to trades, for the right price or favor.

 - [ ]  **Entrance to the Ruined Lair**

`dice: [[Xenâ€™drik#^random-encounters]]`

* Two DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) checks required to find the Ruined Lair, with any failures resulting in a random encounter (above).
* There are six statues in the entryway, each with an outstretched hand. The party will enter "test chambers" and solve a puzzle with one of those themes. At the end, they get an orb and put it in the appropriate statue's hand. So part of the test is identifying what they are being tested on.
	* Valenar Half-Elf (Strength, Red Orb)
	* Changeling (Dexterity, Yellow Orb)
	* Giant (Constitution, Orange Orb)
	* Undying Soldier (Intelligence, Blue Orb)
	* Gnome (Wisdom, Green Orb)
	* Dwarf (Charisma, Purple Orb)
* Past the statues is a door into another chamber, that contains six doors. Each can be opened and closed freely, just by walking near or away, and behind each is one of the scenes below (roll a d6 to determine).
* Once the players return and place all of the orbs in the appropriate statue's hand, a stone staircase downward appears in the ground (leading to the Former Chamber of the Oracular Guardian below).

 - [ ]  **1 - Strength**: The Hall of Might

* The party enters a large chamber where in the center of the room there's a massive, ancient anvil with a beautiful, unlit forge beside it. The challenge is to reignite the forge using a huge, heavy bellows that requires significant effort to pump, and then use the anvil to forge a sphere from a provided red ingot and tools (including a spherical mold that should serve as a hint).
* One player will need to man the bellows, succeeding on DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks in order to keep the fire going. Another player will need to man the anvil, succeeding on two successful DC 12 Strength (Sleight of Hand) checks (adding proficiency with Smith Tools, if applicable) before two failures - which would cause the sphere to shatter, requiring the player to start over.

 - [ ]  **2 - Dexterity**: The Chamber of Agility

* This room is filled with a complex array of laser-like beams of light criss-crossing the room, moving and shifting in patterns. The party must navigate through the maze without touching the beams, reaching the other side to retrieve a lightweight, floating yellow orb. Touching a beam causes a Swarm of Prismatic Beetles to be released from a hole in the ceiling.
* An ability challenge of Dexterity checks, requiring 3 successes. Players can use any Dexterity-based checks (especially skills usually based on other abilities) that they can justify. For example, using Dexterity (Performance) might entail flipping over and through beams, like an action movie.

`encounter: 1: Prismatic Beetle Swarm`

 - [ ]  **3 - Constitution**: The Poison Vault of Endurance

* The room is filled with a thick, poisonous gas that obscures vision and slowly depletes health. A series of valves throughout the room must be closed to clear the air, but each takes time to shut off, testing the party's ability to withstand the harsh conditions. The final valve releases the orange orb along with fresh air.
* Four valves have to be closed, each by attempting a Constitution (Athletics) check with a random DC, determined by rolling a d20 and adding 10. Each valve can be closed at the same time by a different player, or some might require more than one player to get it done. Each action or check performed takes one minute.
* A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round).
* For each round that any PC is exposed to the gas, they take `dice:1d4` poison damage; any breathing in the poisonous gas take `dice:1d12` poison damage. Each round that any PC is holding their breath, they'll need to make a Constitution save against the poisonous gas (DC is 10 + the last damage taken). On a failure, they stop holding their breath and immediately start taking additional damage from the gas.

 - [ ]  **4 - Intelligence**: The Tendril Test

* A blue orb sits on a pedestal in the center of a 40 foot wide square room. When anyone approaches within 10 feet of the pedestal, black tendrils rise from each 5-foot square of the floor and grope blindly at creatures in the room. Any player moving within that space must make a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check to determine if they're touched by a tendril. Anyone touched by a tendril loses one point of Intelligence (until a long rest or a restoration spell).

 - [ ]  **5 - Wisdom**: Mouse/rat Challenge

* There's a green orb visible under a large pile of rubble, with a small hole in it. A small animal (such as Aither's rat) could fit through the hole and retrieve it, requiring a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.
* The area just on the other side of the rubble is rigged with devices that emit high-pitched sounds, inaudible to most races but distressing to small animals. When any small animal nears the orb, the sound causes it to want to run away. A more difficult DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check could be used to coax the animal to continue. Or possibly the sound could be disabled or negated in some way if the PCs figure out that's what's going on (a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check would allow the PC to hear the sound).
* Small rat-like creatures known as Musteval Guardinal (also introduced as a possible monster encounter in Reigney's lair) can be found moving in and out of the pile of rubble - animalistic Celestials that resemble Humanoids with bestial traits, and who embody the beauty, calm, and righteousness of their home plane. If the sonic device (above) is triggered, the Musteval Guardinals will flee the room entirely. They will only attack if provoked or directly attacked.

`encounter: 1d6: Musteval Guardinal`

 - [ ]  **6 - Charisma**: The Court of Shadows

>The room is dimly lit, with ethereal shadows flitting across the walls. The orb you seek is held aloft in the room's center, bound by chains of shadow. Suddenly, a circle of shadowy figures, an otherworldly audience, appears in the center of the room.
>The largest one addresses you: "We seek something that only living beings can offer - a story, a memory, or a promise of a deed to be done in our name."

* The room is dimly lit, with ethereal shadows flitting across the walls. In the center, a circle of shadowy figures appears, representing an otherworldly audience. The purple orb they seek is held aloft in the room's center, bound by chains of shadow that only the court's favor can unlock. The Court of Shadows seeks something that only living beings can offer - a story, a memory, or a promise of a deed to be done in their name.
* A player must offer something of personal value - not in the material sense but in the form of a story, secret, or vow. This requires a Charisma (Performance) check to convey the story compellingly, or Charisma (Persuasion) to negotiate the terms of the vow.
* If the shadows are satisfied with the offering, they release the orb. If not, they may demand a higher price or a different type of story, possibly leading to a series of increasingly personal tales until one finally wins their favor.

 - [ ]  **Former Chamber of the Oracular Guardian**

* When they arrive, there's no one here, but there is a pedestal with a map engraved on it. If the players place their map on top, then the sphinx runes light up and create a holographic version of a younger Flamewind.
* There's also a side table with a notebook on it, scribbled with ancient notes from Flamewind herself. Inside is the Lantern of Seeking command word for Giants (which the players can decide).
* The recording should let them know that the pedestal is designed to detect magical auras, and can direct them to objects of great power that may assist them in their quest. At this point, the pedestal lights up with new points, outlining the [[Future Adventure Concepts]] that are possible new locations for the PCs to explore.
	* Possibly come up with an ultimate weapon that can help them defeat the dragons (possibly something that allows them to join the masks together in some way - Megazord style).
* Before they leave, big cats (one for each member of the party) with similar coloration to Flamewind and adorned with gold, attack the party.

`encounter: 1: Bastet Temple Cat`

 - [ ]  **Optional: The Obsidian City**

* Obsidian City is a legendary ruined city of the giants in the jungles of Xen'drik. It is located on the Skyfall Peninsula, midway between the city of Stormreach and the Titan's Teeth.
* Though once built by giants, the drow of the Sulatar tribe now live in the ruins of the city. The firebinders favor the stone buildings to the jungle and consider it their capital. Since the Sulatar outside of this city stay in hiding, it is difficult to determine how many of this group of drow exist or even where they mostly reside.
* Legends speak of a nearby cave which is said to house an ancient necromantic wyrm - rumored to be a remnant of the extinct Qabalrin faction of elves. The Qabalrin elves were the first mortals to discover the great mysteries of necromancy. They are said to be responsible for the creation of the firstÂ vampires. More recent stories tell of a (topaz) dragon who arrived here many years ago, and left changes. The high priestess knows the details of the story.
* **High Priestess Shyra Velnarin**. The formidable leader of a small but resilient settlement of Sulatar drow in the enigmatic Obsidian City. Shyra is a striking figure; her skin is a deep charcoal hue, a mark of her Sulatar heritage, contrasting vividly with her bright, molten-gold eyes that seem to flicker with inner flames. Her long, jet-black hair is usually pulled back and braided with threads of obsidian beads, reflecting her status. She wears traditional Sulatar robes adorned with fiery motifs. Shyra is a visionary leader, deeply passionate about the Sulatar's survival and their ancient ways of life. She is known for her wisdom, her fierce determination, and a temper as volatile as the magic she wields.
