### Background and Hook(s)

* Flamewind's lair has been mostly ruined with time. There is still information the players can glean though.
* Valmoc will know the location of Flamewind's former lair, and will direct the players that way after Flamewind is killed during the attack on Sharn (after Flamewind has also directed them there with her dying breath).

### Characters and Locations

* **Flamewind** (Gynosphinx).

* **[[Stormreach]]**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  The Attack on Morgrave University

* When the party lands in Sharn, Valmoc immediately excuses himself and parts with the group, only saying that he has some things to check in on (in his usual cryptic way).
* As the party arrives at Morgrave University, the first thing they see is an Adult White Dragon using its breath weapon to attack the university, and specifically Lareth Hall.
* If the group can get the dragon down to half HP, then it flees by quickly flying north while continuing to spew cold fire across Sharn.
	* At some point during the battle they should hear the dragon say, in Draconic, something like "Stay out of dragon business!"
* Inside Lareth Hall, the party will find Flamewind, mortally wounded. With her dying breath, she tells the group to seek out her former lair in Xen'drik (and that Valmoc knows the way). She then lays down without speaking, and begins to slowly disappear.

 - [ ]  **Entrance to the Ruined Lair**

* There are six statues in the entryway, each with an outstretched hand. The party will enter "test chambers" and solve a puzzle with one of those themes. At the end, they get an orb and put it in the appropriate statue's hand. So part of the test is identifying what they are being tested on.
	* Giant (Constitution)
	* Gnome (Wisdom)
	* Undying Soldier (Intelligence)
	* Valenar Half-Elf (Strength)
	* Changeling (Dexterity)
	* Dwarf (Charisma)
* Past the statues is a door into another chamber, that contains six doors. Each can be opened and closed freely, just by walking near or away, and behind each is one of the scenes below.

 - [ ]  **Strength**: The Hall of Might

* The party enters a large chamber where in the center of the room there's a massive, ancient anvil with a beautiful, unlit forge beside it. The challenge is to reignite the forge using a huge, heavy bellows that requires significant effort to pump, and then use the anvil to forge a sphere from a provided ingot and tools.
* One player will need to man the bellows, succeeding on DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks in order to keep the fire going. Another player will need to man the anvil, succeeding on two successful DC 12 Strength (Sleight of Hand) checks (adding proficiency with Smith Tools, if applicable) before two failures - which would cause the sphere to shatter, requiring the player to start over.

 - [ ]  **Dexterity**: The Chamber of Agility

* This room is filled with a complex array of laser-like beams of light criss-crossing the room, moving and shifting in patterns. The party must navigate through the maze without touching the beams, reaching the other side to retrieve a lightweight, floating orb. Touching a beam would reset the individual's progress to the room's entrance.
* An ability challenge of Dexterity checks, requiring 3 successes. Players can use any Dexterity-based checks (especially skills usually based on other abilities) that they can justify. For example, using Dexterity (Performance) might entail flipping over and through beams, like an action movie.

 - [ ]  **Constitution**: The Poison Vault of Endurance

* The room is filled with a thick, poisonous gas that obscures vision and slowly depletes health. A series of valves throughout the room must be closed to clear the air, but each takes time to shut off, testing the party's ability to withstand the harsh conditions. The final valve releases the orb along with fresh air.
* Four valves have to be closed, each by attempting a Constitution (Athletics) check with a random DC, determined by rolling a d20 and adding 10. Each valve can be closed at the same time by a different player, or some might require more than one player to get it done. Each action or check performed takes one minute.
* A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round).
* For each round that any PC is exposed to the gas, they take `dice:1d4` poison damage; any breathing in the poisonous gas take `dice:1d12` poison damage. Each round that any PC is holding their breath, they'll need to make a Constitution save against the poisonous gas (DC is 10 + the last damage taken). On a failure, they stop holding their breath and immediately start taking additional damage from the gas.

 - [ ]  **Intelligence**: The Tendril Test

* An orb sits on a pedestal in the center of a room. When anyone approaches within 10 feet of the pedestal, black tendrils rise from each 5-foot square of the floor and grope blindly at creatures in the room. Players must make a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check to determine if they're touched by a tendril. Anyone touched by a tendril loses one point of Intelligence (until a long rest or a restoration spell).

 - [ ]  **Wisdom**

* There's an orb visible under a large pile of rubble, with a small hole in it. A small animal (such as Aither's rat) could fit through the hole and retrieve it, requiring a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.
* The area just on the other side of the rubble is rigged with devices that emit high-pitched sounds, inaudible to most races but distressing to small animals. When any small animal nears the orb, the sound causes it to want to run away. A more difficult DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check could be used to coax the animal to continue. Or possibly the sound could be disabled or negated in some way if the PCs figure out that's what's going on (a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check would allow the PC to hear the sound).
* Small rat-like creatures known as Musteval Guardinal (also introduced as a possible monster encounter in Reigney's lair) can be found moving in and out of the pile of rubble - animalistic Celestials that resemble Humanoids with bestial traits, and who embody the beauty, calm, and righteousness of their home plane. If the sonic device (above) is triggered, the Musteval Guardinals will flee the room entirely. They will only attack if provoked or directly attacked.

 - [ ]  **Charisma**: The Court of Shadows

>The room is dimly lit, with ethereal shadows flitting across the walls. The orb you seek is held aloft in the room's center, bound by chains of shadow. Suddenly, a circle of shadowy figures, an otherworldly audience, appears in the center of the room.
>The largest one addresses you: "We seek something that only living beings can offer - a story, a memory, or a promise of a deed to be done in our name."

* The room is dimly lit, with ethereal shadows flitting across the walls. In the center, a circle of shadowy figures appears, representing an otherworldly audience. The orb they seek is held aloft in the room's center, bound by chains of shadow that only the court's favor can unlock. The Court of Shadows seeks something that only living beings can offer - a story, a memory, or a promise of a deed to be done in their name.
* A player must offer something of personal value - not in the material sense but in the form of a story, secret, or vow. This requires a Charisma (Performance) check to convey the story compellingly, or Charisma (Persuasion) to negotiate the terms of the vow.
* If the shadows are satisfied with the offering, they release the orb. If not, they may demand a higher price or a different type of story, possibly leading to a series of increasingly personal tales until one finally wins their favor.

 - [ ]  **Former Lair of the Oracular Guardian**

* When they arrive, there's no one here, but there is a pedestal with a map engraved on it. If the players place their map on top, then the sphinx runes light up and create a holographic version of a younger Flamewind. A recording should direct them toward an ultimate weapon that can help them defeat the dragons (possibly something that allows them to join the masks together in some way - Megazord style).
	* Also have the pedestal light up with new points when the map is removed, outlining the [[Future Adventure Concepts]] that are possible new locations for the PCs to visit.
* Maybe some sort of battle with Flamewind? Like a spectral version, or an evil doppelganger or something? At CR 11, could be a good stepping stone to the final battle.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  The "R"-like symbol of the Sphinx (which also carries a strange resemblance to the Mark of Revelation), was originally the symbol of the king of the sphinxes.
 - [ ]  The spiral symbol over Argonnessen on the map is an ancient symbol depicting one of the Overlords, Tiamat (also known as the daughter of Khyber).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Should make heavy use of the Lantern of Seeking. Possibly embed several of the creature types as encounters in the dungeon, with the ability to bypass encounters and find multiple routes by using the lantern.
* Could do a fully gamified dungeon, where at some point the characters can look out over a maze from above. The same maze they've been navigating with the lantern.
* Monsters: Bastet Temple Cat (ToB1, the Fascinating Lure action is just too fun for a group that loves cats), Millitaur (ToB1), Prismatic Beetle (ToB1)
