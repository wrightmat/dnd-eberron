### Background and Hook(s)

* This adventure heavily makes use of the Lantern of Seeking. Possibly embed several of the creature types as encounters in the dungeon, with the ability to bypass encounters and find multiple routes by using the lantern.

### Characters and Locations

* Steel Dragon NPC?

* Darguun?
* Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light. 

### Scenes and Situations

##### Labyrinth Mechanics

* The labyrinth operates on ten minute explorations rounds as the players take actions and navigate the maze, but it always takes a full hour to move between areas. Every hour (use a d6 as a countdown timer), the labyrinth's guardian (the Steel Millitaur, see below for details) makes a move closer to the PCs.
* The PCs can attempt to approach any area they would like, but need to roll a d6 to do so. If the roll matches the chamber number they're going for, then they get there no problem. If the roll matches an adjacent area then they end up there instead (without losing any time). If the roll doesn't match any adjacent or desired chamber, then the player is totally lost and loses an hour wandering (remaining in the area they started in, with the ability to try again next turn). Players make the d6 roll with advantage (two d6s, and can choose the one they prefer, so double the chance to get the result they want) if using an appropriate command word for the Lantern of Seeking.
* If the Millitaur catches up to the players, it engages in combat for two to three rounds before fleeing again. The point being to toy with the players and slowly exhaust their resources. Only short rests would be possible here, since the Millitaur is on the move every hour.
* A series of symbols are scattered throughout the labyrinth. When pieced together, they create the command word for Constructs, which the players can use to track the Steel Millitaur. One symbol is located in each area (except for the central area where the Millitaur resides), and outlined in the scene details below. The command word is "Eversteel", and the symbols found in each area represent the distinct letters of E V R S T L.

##### Dungeon Features

- **Walls and Floors**. The labyrinth's walls are constructed from blocks of aged, weathered stone that reach up to 20 feet in height. They are thick and robust, often covered in a patina of moss and patches of lichen, giving them an ancient and forgotten look. Some sections of the wall are etched with faded runes or bas-reliefs depicting scenes from forgotten myths. Floors are laid with uneven cobblestones that show signs of extensive wear. In places, grass and small plants have begun to reclaim parts of the path, growing between the stones and adding to the sense of age and decay.
- **Doors**. The labyrinth features heavy stone doors that blend seamlessly into the walls. These doors are occasionally adorned with iron reinforcements or ancient carvings that serve as clues or warnings. They may require specific mechanisms to open, ranging from solving a riddle to finding a hidden lever or placing the correct object in a receptacle.
- **Windows**. There are no traditional windows in the labyrinth, reinforcing the feeling of enclosure and isolation. However, narrow arrow slits or small, barred openings occasionally pierce the walls at irregular intervals, offering glimpses of the obscured sky above or into darkened chambers beyond.
- **Light**. Natural light barely penetrates the labyrinth, with only faint beams filtering down from the rare openings in the ceiling. The primary source of light is the pulsating glow from the Lantern of Seeking carried by the adventurers. Some areas might be illuminated by glowing fungi, phosphorescent moss, or other magical light sources embedded in the architecture, casting eerie shadows and creating an atmosphere filled with mystery and caution.
- **Guardian**. The labyrinth is guarded by a stalking guardian, a Steel Minotaur that carries axes and skitters mechanically but quietly through the halls. Each hour, the Millitaur tries to get closer to the PCs (or the closest individual or group if the party is split). The Millitaur knows the labyrinth layout, so it makes all rolls with advantage, but otherwise follows the same roll rules as the players. Since the Millitaur begins in the central chamber, and returns there at every opportunity, it has a 33% chance of approaching the PCs each round.

Random table

 - [ ]  **Guardian's Clue**
>As you cross the ancient stone threshold, the temperature drops, sending a chill down your spine. You enter a vast labyrinth constructed of weathered stone walls that tower above you, their surfaces covered in patches of moss and lichen. The path underfoot is uneven, made of worn cobblestones that echo with each step you take.
>Standing sentinel at the entrance is a towering statue of a hooded guardian, carved from the same dark stone as the labyrinth walls. In its outstretched hand, it holds a lantern that casts a haunting, pulsating light. The statueâ€™s eyes, made of reflective onyx, seem to watch your every move with an unnerving intensity.
>As you approach, the statue comes to life with a slow, grinding noise of stone on stone. In a deep, echoing voice, it intones,
>"In darkness and light, I guide your fate,  
Shifting hues reveal what may lie in wait.  
With every step and turn you make,  
Choose your path, make no mistake.
>Silent footsteps follow where you've led,  
A looming shadow fills hearts with dread.  
With colored light guide your quest,  
Each hue a key to what lurks or rests."

The entrance to the labyrinth is marked by an ancient statue that comes to life when approached. It explains that the labyrinth is alive and that the lantern will guide them but also attract the attention of the Millitaur, a formidable monstrosity that stalks its paths. The statue offers a riddle that hints at the lantern's use and the importance of choosing paths wisely. Solving the riddle provides a clue about using the lantern to avoid or engage with specific creature types.

The labyrinth is divided into separate areas, six of them, with the Millitaur chamber in the center. Each area is themed around a different creature type. When the players enter the labyrinth, they're faced with three directions - left (undead), right (monstrosities or beasts), or forward (constructs), with the lantern automatically glowing a different color as they start down each path.

A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "E".

 - [ ]  **Combat or Social Encounter**



 - [ ]  **Rest Room**



##### 2: Elementals / Oozes

 - [ ]  **Multilingual Door**

-  A large door with what looks like seven locks with various writings on it. There is a thick iron turning handle in the center of the door.
	- The first lock says "Open" in Common.
	- The second lock says "Close" in Elvish.
	- The third lock says "Open" in Dwarvish.
	- The fourth lock says "Close" in Infernal.
	- The fifth lock says "Open" in Giant.
	- The seventh lock says "Close" in Halfling.
	- The sixth lock says "Close" in Draconic.
- The objective of the puzzle is to unlock the locks which say "Open" (DC 10, or the trap goes off) and to leave the locks which say "Close" closed, and then turn the door handle, otherwise the [[glyph of warding]] (explosive rune, 5d8 lightning damage) above the door activates. The challenge comes from the character's language limitations (they may have to do some guess-work).

 - [ ]  **Elemental Chessboard**

- When the players enter the room, they find a life-sized chessboard with pieces representing the four classical elements: air, water, earth, and fire. A closed door can be seen on the far side of the room.
- This isn't an actual chess game, but instead a challenge to clear the board and get safely to the other side. Each monster has a distinct weakness that another monster can take advantage of very quickly. For example, a fire-based beast might be easy for a water-based creature to extinguish. It is up to the players to lure each monster towards another, to pit them against each other, as if in a mini tournament.
- Alternatively, the players could just fight all of the monsters, but this could be deadly.
- Once all pieces have been destroyed, the door opens.

 - [ ]  **Room of Elemental Rest**

Fire elemental in an ornate fireplace, water elemental jumping around in a beautiful fountain, air elemental stirring up a cool breeze throughout the room, etc. Players can rest here (short rest only).

##### 3: Giants

 - [ ]  **Puzzle or Challenge**

- Giant key that needs to be shrunk down in order to fit inside a lock. Or the opposite, a giant lock that needs an especially large key, or a regular sized key that needs to be enlarged. Would have to put a spell scroll of enlarge/reduce somewhere in the dungeon to ensure it could be done.

 - [ ]  **Combat or Social Encounter**



 - [ ]  **Rest Room**



##### 4: Fiends

 - [ ]  **Puzzle or Challenge**

* A sentient door that can't be opened (i.e. not lock-picked or broken down). Actually felt very insulted once we tried breaking it down. Would tease us and put us down. Call us stupid and point out other flaws. The only way to get through was to admit one of the put-downs the door directed at us. I.e. Yes, I am stupid. Then you could just walk through as if it was an illusion.

 - [ ]  **Combat or Social Encounter**



 - [ ]  **Rest Room**



##### 5: Monstrosities / Beasts

 - [ ]  **Puzzle or Challenge**

- The party arrives in a room with a statue of a man in the middle. He is looking directly at a statue of a basilisk. The characters notice the key to the door needed to continue is around his neck, but is also made of stone and they can't take it. They must figure out that you have to find a way to block their line of sight (like cover the man's eyes with a cloth), the man comes back to life and gives you the key, he can be used as a guide to the rest of the dungeon.

 - [ ]  **Combat or Social Encounter**



 - [ ]  **Rest Room**



##### 6: Steel Millitaur Chamber

 - [ ]  **Phantom Doorway**

- When the players encounter the Phantom Doorway, it appears to be a mundane door, indistinguishable from any other in the dungeon. However, when opened and entered, the doorway's magic is triggered, transporting the character to a location different from what they expected. This location could be another room within the dungeon, an extradimensional space, or even a completely separate plane of existence. To detect the true nature of the Phantom Doorway, the players must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 16) or use a spell like detect magic or identify. If they successfully discern the door's illusory nature, they can attempt to dispel the enchantment or find an alternative means of bypassing the doorway.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* At this point the PCs should have command words for: Giants, Monstrosities or Beasts, Undead, Fey or Plants, and Celestials. That means we need to give the command words for Aberrations, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals or Oozes, and Fiends (or not use these creature types at all in this dungeon). We probably won't use Aberrations at all, and will likely save the command word for Dragons for later (likely the Crystal Library).
* The Lantern should be influenced by the magic of the labyrinth and turn on automatically, to whatever appropriate color, whenever a creature is nearby. This can be overridden if a command word is spoken, so the players can still check for creatures if they'd like.
* Monsters: Millitaur (ToB1), but adapted to a higher CR and a Construct type (Steel Millitaur).
* Might be a good place to introduce the NPC who will eventually be revealed as a Steel Dragon.
