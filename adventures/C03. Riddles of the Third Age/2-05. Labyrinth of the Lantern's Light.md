### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Guardian's Riddle

 - [ ]  **Initial Encounter**

The entrance to the labyrinth is marked by an ancient statue that comes to life when approached. It explains that the labyrinth is alive and that the lantern will guide them but also attract the attention of the Millitaur, a formidable monstrosity that stalks its paths.

 - [ ]  **Guardian Challenge**

The statue offers a riddle that hints at the lantern's use and the importance of choosing paths wisely. Solving the riddle provides a clue about using the lantern to avoid or engage with specific creature types.

##### 2: The Chamber of Choices

 - [ ]  **Path Selection**

The party encounters a chamber with multiple exits; each path radiates a different colored light when the lantern is held up, indicating the type of creatures that lurk down each path. Players must decide which challenges they're prepared to face.

 - [ ]  **Creature Interaction**

Choosing a path leads to an encounter where players can either combat the creatures, sneak past them, or possibly negotiate. Each creature type offers different challenges and rewards, influencing the party's strategy in the labyrinth.

##### 3: The Echoes of the Millitaur

 - [ ]  **Millitaur's Presence**

As the party progresses, the lantern pulses a warning color whenever the Millitaur is near, forcing the party to make quick decisions on their path to avoid an untimely confrontation.

 - [ ]  **False Leads**

A section of the labyrinth magically mimics the lantern's guidance colors, leading to dead ends or traps. The party must discern the lantern's true guidance from the labyrinth's deceptions, possibly using knowledge gained from earlier creature encounters to navigate.

##### 4: The Arena of Shadows

 - [ ]  **Inevitable Encounter**

The labyrinth channels the party into an arena where the Millitaur finally confronts them. This area is designed for the confrontation, with the lantern's light revealing hidden traps or aids in the environment that can help turn the tide of battle.

 - [ ]  **Using the Lantern**

Mid-battle, the lantern reveals the Millitaur's weakness or a method to trap it, highlighting the importance of understanding and utilizing the creature types it detects, and turning the labyrinth's design against the Millitaur.

##### 5: The Heart of the Labyrinth

 - [ ]  **Treasure and Knowledge**

Defeating or outsmarting the Millitaur grants access to the center of the labyrinth, where treasures and ancient knowledge await. The treasure includes Lantern of Seeking command words for any creature types defeated during the adventure.

 - [ ]  **The Labyrinth's Reversal**

The labyrinth is revealed to be a testing ground or prison for the Millitaur. The party's actions have liberated a second Millitaur that chases them back out of the labyrinth.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* At this point the PCs should have command words for: Giants, Monstrosities or Beasts, Undead, Fey or Plants, and Celestials. That means we need to give the command words for Aberrations, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals or Oozes, and Fiends (or not use these creature types at all in this dungeon). We probably won't use Aberrations at all, and will likely save the command word for Dragons for later (likely the Crystal Library).
* The Lantern should be influenced by the magic of the labyrinth and turn on automatically, to whatever appropriate color, whenever a creature is nearby. This can be overridden if a command word is spoken, so the players can still check for creatures if they'd like.
* Have a series of symbols scattered throughout the labyrinth that when pieced together create the command word for Constructs, which the players can use to track the Steel Millitaur. One symbol should be in each area (except for the central area where the Millitaur resides). The command word is "Eversteel", and the symbols found in each area represent the distinct letters of E V R S T L.
* The labyrinth is divided into separate areas, six of them, with the Millitaur chamber in the center. Each area is themed around a different creature type. When the players enter the labyrinth, they're faced with three directions - left (undead), right (monstrosities or beasts), or forward (constructs), with the lantern glowing a different color as they go down each path.
* The PCs can approach any area they would like, but need to roll a d6 to do so. If the roll matches the chamber number they're going for, then they get there no problem. If the roll matches an adjacent area then they end up there instead (without losing any time). If the roll doesn't match any adjacent or desired chamber, then the player is totally lost and loses an hour wandering (remaining in the area they started in, with the ability to try again next turn). Players make the d6 roll with advantage (two d6s, and can choose the one they prefer, so double the chance to get the result they want) if using an appropriate command word for the Lantern of Seeking.
* Each hour, the Millitaur tries to get closer to the PCs (or the closest individual or group if the party is split). The Millitaur knows the labyrinth layout, so it makes all rolls with advantage, but otherwise follows the same roll rules as the players. Since the Millitaur begins in the central chamber, and returns there at every opportunity, it has a 33% chance of approaching the PCs each round.
* Monsters: Millitaur (ToB1), but adapted to a higher CR and a Construct type (Steel Millitaur).
* Might be a good place to introduce the NPC who will eventually be revealed as a Steel Dragon.
