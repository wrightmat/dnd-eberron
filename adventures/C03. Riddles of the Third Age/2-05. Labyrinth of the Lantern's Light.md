### Background and Hook(s)

* This adventure heavily makes use of the Lantern of Seeking. Embedding several creature types as encounters in the dungeon, as well as traps and puzzles. While the players search the labyrinth, they are stalked by a powerful guardian construct, the Metal Minotaur.
* Oliver Ramorell, Quartermaster of the *Celeste Noir*, is originally from Darguun, and can be used to direct the party to the appropriate place.

### Characters and Locations

* **Serelath** (unaligned male steel dragon, disguised as a human). A Steel Dragon who took on human form to explore the world of mortals, driven by his innate curiosity and a dragon's love for collecting treasures and secrets. He ventured into the labyrinth years ago, intrigued by its mysteries and the powerful artifacts rumored to be hidden within. His knowledge of ancient magics and civilizations led him deeper into the maze until he encountered the basilisk statue, which turned him to stone. In his human form, he appears as a rugged adventurer in his mid-forties, with steely gray hair and piercing blue eyes. His attire consists of well-worn leather armor and a faded cloak, hinting at decades of exploration.
* **Baalo One-Eye** (CE male hobgoblin). Leader of the Khraal Lords, a band of pirates and raiders based in the Khraal rainforest of Darguun, known for their savagery.

* **Wyvernskull**. A small town in Darguun and the primary seaport in the country. It is located in southern Darguun, lying on the mouth of Torlaac River on the north-eastern shore of Torlaac Bay. The Khraal rainforest rises to the east.
* **Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light**. A stone labyrinth hidden deep in the Khraal rainforest.

### Scenes and Situations

##### Labyrinth Mechanics

* The labyrinth operates on ten minute explorations rounds as the players take actions and navigate the maze, but it always takes a full hour to move between areas. Every hour (use a d6 as a countdown timer), the labyrinth's guardian (the Metal Minotaur, see below for details) makes a move closer to the PCs.
* The PCs can attempt to approach any area they would like, but need to roll a d6 to do so. If the roll matches the chamber number they're going for, then they get there no problem. If the roll matches an adjacent area then they end up there instead (without losing any time). If the roll doesn't match any adjacent or desired chamber, then the player is totally lost and loses an hour wandering (remaining in the area they started in, with the ability to try again next turn). Players make the d6 roll with advantage (two d6s, and can choose the one they prefer, so double the chance to get the result they want) if using an appropriate command word for the Lantern of Seeking.
* If the Metal Minotaur catches up to the players, it engages in combat for two to three rounds before fleeing again. The point being to toy with the players and slowly exhaust their resources. Only short rests would be possible here, since the Metal Minotaur is on the move every hour.
* A series of symbols are scattered throughout the labyrinth. When pieced together, they create the command word for Constructs, which the players can use to track the Metal Minotaur. One symbol is located in each area (except for the central area where the Metal Minotaur resides), and outlined in the scene details below. The command word is "Eversteel", and the symbols found in each area represent the distinct letters of E V R S T L.

##### Dungeon Features

- **Walls and Floors**. The labyrinth's walls are constructed from blocks of aged, weathered stone that reach up to 20 feet in height. They are thick and robust, often covered in a patina of moss and patches of lichen, giving them an ancient and forgotten look. Some sections of the wall are etched with faded runes or bas-reliefs depicting scenes from forgotten myths. Floors are laid with uneven cobblestones that show signs of extensive wear. In places, grass and small plants have begun to reclaim parts of the path, growing between the stones and adding to the sense of age and decay.
- **Doors**. The labyrinth features heavy stone doors that blend seamlessly into the walls. These doors are occasionally adorned with iron reinforcements or ancient carvings that serve as clues or warnings. They may require specific mechanisms to open, ranging from solving a riddle to finding a hidden lever or placing the correct object in a receptacle.
- **Windows**. There are no traditional windows in the labyrinth, reinforcing the feeling of enclosure and isolation. However, narrow arrow slits or small, barred openings occasionally pierce the walls at irregular intervals, offering glimpses of the obscured sky above or into darkened chambers beyond.
- **Light**. Natural light barely penetrates the labyrinth, with only faint beams filtering down from the rare openings in the ceiling. The primary source of light is the pulsating glow from the Lantern of Seeking carried by the adventurers. Some areas might be illuminated by glowing fungi, phosphorescent moss, or other magical light sources embedded in the architecture, casting eerie shadows and creating an atmosphere filled with mystery and caution.
- **Guardian**. The labyrinth is guarded by a stalking guardian, a Metal Minotaur that carries axes and stalks mechanically but quietly through the halls. Each hour, the Metal Minotaur tries to get closer to the PCs (or the closest individual or group if the party is split). The Minotaur knows the labyrinth layout, so it makes all rolls with advantage, but otherwise follows the same roll rules as the players. Since the Minotaur begins in the central chamber, and returns there at every opportunity, it has a 33% chance of approaching the PCs each round.

##### 0: Before the Labyrinth and Labyrinth Entrance

 - [ ]  **Wyvernskull**

- The Kraal Lords normally harass the goblinoid communities of southern Darguun. Recently, however, they seized two small warships from a Cyran base on the Ghaal River and have begun attacking shipping on Kraken Bay, though they avoid targets that seem better protected or more adept in seamanship than themselves. This makes up the majority of their potential targets, so they've also started launching frequent scavenging expeditions into the Mournland, arriving via the southern coast.
- The Kraal Lords may intercept (or even attack) the party if arriving via sea.

 - [ ]  **Finding the Labyrinth**

- The Khraal rain forest fills the eastern spur of Darguun. Within its dense depths, all manner of strange and dangerous creatures roam. An extensive series of ruins, believed to be from the time of the Dhakaani Empire, lies deep within the vibrant jungle.
- Two DC 16 Survival checks (either as a group check or done by a party member leading the group) required to find the labyrinth through the rainforest, with any failures resulting in a random encounter.

`dice: [[2-05. Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light#^khraal-encounters]]`

 - [ ]  **Guardian's Clue**

- The entrance to the labyrinth is marked by an ancient statue that comes to life when approached. It explains that the labyrinth is alive and that the lantern will guide them but also attract the attention of the Metal Minotaur, a formidable construct that stalks its paths. The statue offers a riddle that hints at the lantern's use and the importance of choosing paths wisely. Solving the riddle provides a clue about using the lantern to avoid or engage with specific creature types.

>As you cross the ancient stone threshold, the temperature drops, sending a chill down your spine. You enter a vast labyrinth constructed of weathered stone walls that tower above you, their surfaces covered in patches of moss and lichen. The path underfoot is uneven, made of worn cobblestones that echo with each step you take.
>Standing sentinel at the entrance is a towering statue of a hooded guardian, carved from the same dark stone as the labyrinth walls. In its outstretched hand, it holds a lantern that casts a haunting, pulsating light. The statue’s eyes, made of reflective stone, seem to watch your every move with an unnerving intensity.
>As you approach, the statue comes to life with a slow, grinding noise of stone on stone. In a deep, echoing voice, it intones,
>"In darkness and light, I guide your fate,  
Shifting hues reveal what may lie in wait.  
With every step and turn you make,  
Choose your path, make no mistake.
>Silent footsteps follow where you've led,  
A looming shadow fills hearts with dread.  
With colored light guide your quest,  
Each hue a key to what lurks or rests."

- The labyrinth is divided into separate areas, six of them, with the Metal Minotaur chamber in the center. Each area is themed around a different creature type. When the players enter the labyrinth, they're faced with three directions - left (undead), right (monstrosities or beasts), or forward (constructs), with the lantern automatically glowing a different color as they start down each path.
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "E".

##### 1: Undead

 - [ ]  **Undead "Key"**

- A large metal door, carved with twisted faces and specked with rotten flesh. Scrawled on the door, in blood, are the words "one of them is the key". If PC's bring a "live" skeleton to the door, it is absorbed into the metal door, which then creaks open.
- In the room are a number of passive undead; zombies, skeletons, ghosts etc, some of them are previous adventurers who died here or in the previous room. They are all just quietly shambling about. Attacking one does not aggro any others.
- On an investigation check, or passive investigation of 14, a PC sees a "fresh" zombie holding a note in its hand, which it will not give up (give it a chain shirt and a shortsword, in case party tries to fight it). To pickpocket the note requires the thief to roll sleight of hand against the zombie's strength check to grip the note. When examined note reads "it's not a zombie"
- On a Perception check, or passive Perception of 12, a PC can hear a ghost muttering to itself. Going closer, the ghost can be heard to say "what sort of key can open any door?". If the PCs need a clue, the ghost can say "a zomb-key? No no no, thats not it" (its a skeleton key!)

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**
>A withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags sits stooped in this room. It pulls back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust.

`encounter: 1: Angatra`

 - [ ]  **Laid to Rest**

- This room is filled with sarcophagi, some of which are empty and some of which aren't. Players can rest here, but the only place to rest is in a sarcophagus. The passive undead from the previous chamber were originally laid to rest here - they could be used to relay any history or other information via their life stories.
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "V".

##### 2: Elementals / Oozes

 - [ ]  **Multilingual Door**

-  A large door with what looks like seven locks with various writings on it. There is a thick iron turning handle in the center of the door.
	- The first lock says "Open" in Common.
	- The second lock says "Close" in Elvish.
	- The third lock says "Open" in Dwarvish.
	- The fourth lock says "Close" in Infernal.
	- The fifth lock says "Open" in Giant.
	- The seventh lock says "Close" in Halfling.
	- The sixth lock says "Close" in Draconic.
- The objective of the puzzle is to unlock the locks which say "Open" (DC 10, or the trap goes off) and to leave the locks which say "Close" closed, and then turn the door handle, otherwise the *[[glyph of warding]]* (explosive rune, 5d8 lightning damage) above the door activates. The challenge comes from the character's language limitations (they may have to do some guess-work).

 - [ ]  **Elemental Chessboard**

- When the players enter the room, they find a life-sized chessboard with pieces representing the four classical elements: air, water, earth, and fire. A closed door can be seen on the far side of the room.
- This isn't an actual chess game, but instead a challenge to clear the board and get safely to the other side. Each monster has a distinct weakness that another monster can take advantage of very quickly. For example, a fire-based beast might be easy for a water-based creature to extinguish. It is up to the players to lure each monster toward another, to pit them against each other, as if in a mini tournament.
- Alternatively, the players could just fight all of the monsters, but this could be deadly.
- Once all pieces have been destroyed, the door opens.

 - [ ]  **Room of Elemental Rest**

- Fire elemental in an ornate fireplace, water elemental jumping around in a beautiful fountain, air elemental stirring up a cool breeze throughout the room, etc. Players can rest here (short rest only).
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "R".

##### 3: Giants

 - [ ]  **Giant Key**

- Giant key that needs to be shrunk down in order to fit inside a lock. Or the opposite, a giant lock that needs an especially large key, or a regular sized key that needs to be enlarged. Would have to put a spell scroll of enlarge/reduce somewhere in the dungeon to ensure it could be done.

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**

`encounter: 1: Degenerate Titan`

 - [ ]  **Giant Living Room**

- This room looks like a comfortable living room, but all of the furniture is sized for giants. The players can rest here (short rest only).
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "S".

##### 4: Fiends

 - [ ]  **Sentient Door**

* A sentient door that can't be opened (i.e. not lock-picked or broken down). Should feel very insulted if opening or breaking down is attempted. Teases the players and puts them down, calling them stupid and pointing out other flaws. The only way to get through is to either succeed on a DC 20 Persuasion check, or admit one of the put-downs the door directed at them. I.e. Yes, I am stupid.

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**
>An immense creature sniffs at the air. Most of its head is covered by a helmet from which one baleful eye gazes out. Its muzzle fuses flesh and machinery, and sharp metal teeth glint from under its lips.

`encounter: 1: Psoglav Demon`

 - [ ]  **Rest Room**

- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "T".

##### 5: Monstrosities / Beasts

 - [ ]  **Man of Stone**

- The party arrives in a room with a statue of a man in the middle. He is looking directly at a statue of a basilisk. The characters notice the key to the door needed to continue is around his neck, but is also made of stone and they can't take it. They must figure out that you have to find a way to block their line of sight (like cover the man's eyes with a cloth), the man comes back to life and gives you the key, he can be used as a guide to the rest of the dungeon.

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**

`encounter: 1: Bukavac`

 - [ ]  **Rest Room**

- Opportunity to have a conversation with Serelath.

>**Serelath:** _(Stretching his limbs and taking a deep breath)_ "Ah, to feel the flow of air and not be merely a part of the decor! My thanks, travelers. I am Serelath, though once I wandered these paths as Serelath the Seeker, a humble explorer of hidden realms."

>**Serelath:** "You have my gratitude for breaking the enchantment that held me captive. It's been... a long while since I've been able to move of my own accord. Time loses meaning when you're part of the scenery."

- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "L".

##### 6: Steel Millitaur Chamber

 - [ ]  **Phantom Doorway**

- When the players encounter the Phantom Doorway, it appears to be a mundane door, indistinguishable from any other in the dungeon. However, when opened and entered, the doorway's magic is triggered, transporting the character to a location different from what they expected. This location could be another room within the dungeon, an extradimensional space, or even a completely separate plane of existence. To detect the true nature of the Phantom Doorway, the players must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 16) or use a spell like detect magic or identify. If they successfully discern the door's illusory nature, they can attempt to dispel the enchantment or find an alternative means of bypassing the doorway.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* At this point the PCs should have command words for: Giants, Monstrosities or Beasts, Undead, Fey or Plants, and Celestials. That means we need to give the command words for Aberrations, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals or Oozes, and Fiends (or not use these creature types at all in this dungeon). We probably won't use Aberrations at all, and will likely save the command word for Dragons for later (likely the Crystal Library).
* The Lantern should be influenced by the magic of the labyrinth and turn on automatically, to whatever appropriate color, whenever a creature is nearby. This can be overridden if a command word is spoken, so the players can still check for creatures if they'd like.
