 #adventure 

### Background and Hook(s)

* This adventure heavily makes use of the Lantern of Seeking. Embedding several creature types as encounters in the dungeon, as well as traps and puzzles. While the players search the labyrinth, they are stalked by a powerful guardian construct, the Metal Minotaur.
* Oliver Ramorell, Quartermaster of the *Celeste Noir*, is originally from Darguun, and can be used to direct the party to the appropriate place.

### Characters and Locations

* **Serelath** (unaligned male steel dragon, disguised as a human adventurer). A Steel Dragon who took on a human form to explore the world of mortals, driven by his innate curiosity and a dragon's love for collecting treasures and secrets. He ventured into the labyrinth years ago, intrigued by its mysteries and the powerful artifacts rumored to be hidden within. His knowledge of ancient magics and civilizations led him deeper into the maze until he encountered a basilisk statue, which turned him to stone. In his human form, he appears as a rugged adventurer in his mid-forties, with steely gray hair and piercing blue eyes. His attire consists of well-worn leather armor and a faded cloak, hinting at decades of exploration.
* **Baalo One-Eye** (CE male hobgoblin). Leader of the Khraal Lords, a band of pirates and raiders based in the Khraal rainforest of Darguun, known for their savagery.

* **Wyvernskull**. A small town in Darguun and the primary seaport in the country. It is located in southern Darguun, lying on the mouth of Torlaac River on the north-eastern shore of Torlaac Bay. The Khraal rainforest rises to the east.
* **Khraal Rainforest**. The Khraal rainforest fills the eastern spur of Darguun. Within its dense depths, all manner of strange and dangerous creatures roam. An extensive series of ruins, believed to be from the time of the Dhakaani Empire, lies deep within the vibrant jungle. A few towns and villages can be found along the edge of the great jungle, but not even the most powerful hobgoblins or bugbears have been brave enough to try to forge settlements within this dangerous environment.
* **Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light**. A stone labyrinth hidden deep in the Khraal rainforest.

### Scenes and Situations

##### Labyrinth Mechanics

* The labyrinth operates on ten minute explorations rounds as the players take actions and navigate the maze, but it always takes a full hour to move between areas. Every hour (use a d6 as a countdown timer), the labyrinth's guardian (the Metal Minotaur, see below for details) makes a move closer to the PCs.
* The PCs can attempt to approach any area they would like, but need to roll a d6 to do so. If the roll matches the chamber number they're going for, then they get there no problem. If the roll matches an adjacent area then they end up there instead (without losing any time). If the roll doesn't match any adjacent or desired chamber, then the player is totally lost and loses an hour wandering (remaining in the area they started in, with the ability to try again next turn). Players make the d6 roll with advantage (two d6s, and can choose the one they prefer, so double the chance to get the result they want) if using an appropriate command word for the Lantern of Seeking.
* If the Metal Minotaur catches up to the players, it engages in combat for two to three rounds before fleeing again. The point being to toy with the players and slowly exhaust their resources. Only short rests would be possible here, since the Metal Minotaur is on the move every hour.
* A series of symbols are scattered throughout the labyrinth. When pieced together, they create the command word for Constructs, which the players can use to track the Metal Minotaur. One symbol is located in each area (except for the central area where the Metal Minotaur resides), and outlined in the scene details below. The command word is "Eversteel", and the symbols found in each area represent the distinct letters of E V R S T L.

##### Dungeon Features

- **Walls and Floors**. The labyrinth's walls are constructed from blocks of aged, weathered stone that reach up to 20 feet in height. They are thick and robust, often covered in a patina of moss and patches of lichen, giving them an ancient and forgotten look. Some sections of the wall are etched with faded runes or bas-reliefs depicting scenes from forgotten myths. Floors are laid with uneven cobblestones that show signs of extensive wear. In places, grass and small plants have begun to reclaim parts of the path, growing between the stones and adding to the sense of age and decay.
- **Doors**. The labyrinth features heavy stone doors that blend seamlessly into the walls. These doors are occasionally adorned with iron reinforcements or ancient carvings that serve as clues or warnings. They may require specific mechanisms to open, ranging from solving a riddle to finding a hidden lever or placing the correct object in a receptacle.
- **Windows**. There are no traditional windows in the labyrinth, reinforcing the feeling of enclosure and isolation. However, narrow arrow slits or small, barred openings occasionally pierce the walls at irregular intervals, offering glimpses of the obscured sky above or into darkened chambers beyond.
- **Light**. Natural light barely penetrates the labyrinth, with only faint beams filtering down from the rare openings in the ceiling. The primary source of light is the pulsating glow from the Lantern of Seeking carried by the adventurers. Some areas might be illuminated by glowing fungi, phosphorescent moss, or other magical light sources embedded in the architecture, casting eerie shadows and creating an atmosphere filled with mystery and caution.
- **Guardian**. The labyrinth is guarded by a stalking guardian, a Metal Minotaur that carries axes and stalks mechanically but quietly through the halls. Each hour, the Metal Minotaur tries to get closer to the PCs (or the closest individual or group if the party is split). The Minotaur knows the labyrinth layout, so it makes all rolls with advantage, but otherwise follows the same roll rules as the players. Since the Minotaur begins in the central chamber, and returns there at every opportunity, it has a 33% chance of approaching the PCs each round.

##### 0: Before the Labyrinth and Labyrinth Entrance

 - [ ]  **Wyvernskull**

- The Kraal Lords normally harass the goblinoid communities of southern Darguun. Recently, however, they seized two small warships from a Cyran base on the Ghaal River and have begun attacking shipping on Kraken Bay, though they avoid targets that seem better protected or more adept in seamanship than themselves. This makes up the majority of their potential targets, so they've also started launching frequent scavenging expeditions into the Mournland, arriving via the southern coast.
- The Kraal Lords may intercept (or even attack) the party if arriving via sea.

 - [ ]  **Finding the Labyrinth**

- The Khraal rain forest fills the eastern spur of Darguun. Within its dense depths, all manner of strange and dangerous creatures roam. An extensive series of ruins, believed to be from the time of the Dhakaani Empire, lies deep within the vibrant jungle.
- Two DC 16 Survival checks (either as a group check or done by a party member leading the group) required to find the labyrinth through the rainforest, with any failures resulting in a random encounter.

`dice: [[2-05. Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light#^khraal-encounters]]`

 - [ ]  **Guardian's Clue**

- The entrance to the labyrinth is marked by an ancient statue that comes to life when approached. It explains that the labyrinth is alive and that the lantern will guide them but also attract the attention of the Metal Minotaur, a formidable construct that stalks its paths. The statue offers a riddle that hints at the lantern's use and the importance of choosing paths wisely. Solving the riddle provides a clue about using the lantern to avoid or engage with specific creature types.

>As you cross the ancient stone threshold, the temperature drops, sending a chill down your spine. You enter a vast labyrinth constructed of weathered stone walls that tower above you, their surfaces covered in patches of moss and lichen. The path underfoot is uneven, made of worn cobblestones that echo with each step you take.
>Standing sentinel at the entrance is a towering statue of a hooded guardian, carved from the same dark stone as the labyrinth walls. In its outstretched hand, it holds a lantern that casts a haunting, pulsating light. The statue’s eyes, made of reflective stone, seem to watch your every move with an unnerving intensity.
>As you approach, the statue comes to life with a slow, grinding noise of stone on stone. In a deep, echoing voice, it intones,
>"In darkness and light, I guide your fate,  
Shifting hues reveal what may lie in wait.  
With every step and turn you make,  
Choose your path, make no mistake.
>Silent footsteps follow where you've led,  
A looming shadow fills hearts with dread.  
With colored light guide your quest,  
Each hue a key to what lurks or rests."

- The labyrinth is divided into separate areas, six of them, with the Metal Minotaur chamber in the center. Each area is themed around a different creature type. When the players enter the labyrinth, they're faced with three directions - left (undead), right (monstrosities or beasts), or forward (constructs), with the lantern automatically glowing a different color as they start down each path.
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "E".

##### 1: Undead

 - [ ]  **Undead "Key"**
>A large metal door before you is grotesquely adorned with twisted faces, their expressions caught between agony and despair. Patches of rotten flesh cling to the cold iron, and the pungent smell of decay fills the air. Scrawled across the door in dried, dark blood are the ominous words, "one of them is the key." As you contemplate these words, you notice various undead creatures shambling about the room.

- A large metal door, carved with twisted faces and specked with rotten flesh. Scrawled on the door, in blood, are the words "one of them is the key". If PCs bring a "live" skeleton to the door, it is absorbed into the metal door, which then creaks open.
- In the room are a number of passive undead; zombies, skeletons, ghosts etc, some of them are previous adventurers who died here or in the previous room. They are all just quietly shambling about. Attacking one does not aggro any others.
- On an investigation check, or passive investigation of 14, a PC sees a "fresh" zombie holding a note in its hand, which it will not give up (give it a chain shirt and a shortsword, in case party tries to fight it). To pickpocket the note requires the thief to roll sleight of hand against the zombie's strength check to grip the note. When examined note reads "it's not a zombie"
- On a Perception check, or passive Perception of 12, a PC can hear a ghost muttering to itself. Going closer, the ghost can be heard to say "what sort of key can open any door?". If the PCs need a clue, the ghost can say "a zomb-key? No no no, thats not it" (its a skeleton key!)

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**
>A withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags sits stooped in this room. It pulls back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust. Roll initiative!

`encounter: 1: Angatra`

 - [ ]  **Laid to Rest**
>You find yourself surrounded by rows of ancient sarcophagi. The air is cool and carries a musty scent, heavy with the dust of ages. Some of the stone coffins lay ajar, their lids partially opened, revealing nothing but shadows within. Others remain sealed, their surfaces etched with inscrutable runes and grim bas-reliefs depicting scenes of the afterlife. The silence here is profound, broken only by the faint echo of your own footsteps.

- This room is filled with sarcophagi, some of which are empty and some of which aren't. Players can rest here, but the only place to rest is in a sarcophagus. The passive undead from the previous chamber were originally laid to rest here - they could be used to relay any history or other information via their life stories.
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "V".

##### 2: Elementals / Oozes

 - [ ]  **Multilingual Door**
>Before you stands a massive door, its surface a patchwork of varied materials that seem almost alive with a subtle, shifting movement. Encircling a thick iron handle at the door's center are seven distinct locks, each adorned with cryptic writings in different scripts, glowing faintly as if imbued with elemental energy.

- A large door with what looks like seven locks with various writings on it. There is a thick iron turning handle in the center of the door.
	- The first lock says "Open" in Common.
	- The second lock says "Close" in Elvish.
	- The third lock says "Open" in Dwarvish.
	- The fourth lock says "Close" in Infernal.
	- The fifth lock says "Open" in Giant.
	- The sixth lock says "Close" in Halfling.
	- The seventh lock says "Close" in Draconic.
- The objective of the puzzle is to unlock the locks which say "Open" (DC 10, or the trap goes off) and to leave the locks which say "Close" closed, and then turn the door handle, otherwise the *[[glyph of warding]]* (explosive rune, `dice:5d8` lightning damage) above the door activates. The challenge comes from the character's language limitations (they may have to do some guess-work).

 - [ ]  **Elemental Chessboard**
>As you step into the chamber, the floor unfolds into a vast, life-sized chessboard, its squares alternating in ebony and ivory. Towering chess pieces, carved from the very essence of the classical elements, stand poised for battle: swirling air rooks, crackling fire bishops, solid earth knights, and flowing water queens. The scent of ozone, the rustle of breezes, the rumble of stone, and the murmur of waves fill the air, infusing the room with the raw forces of nature. At the far end of the board, a closed door awaits, challenging you to navigate this elemental contest and reach the other side by exploiting the unique vulnerabilities of each piece.

- When the players enter the room, they find a life-sized chessboard with pieces representing the four classical elements: air, water, earth, and fire. A closed door can be seen on the far side of the room.
- This isn't an actual chess game, but instead a challenge to clear the board and get safely to the other side. Each monster has a distinct weakness that another monster can take advantage of very quickly. For example, a fire-based beast might be easy for a water-based creature to extinguish. It is up to the players to lure each monster toward another, to pit them against each other, as if in a mini tournament.
- Alternatively, the players could just fight all of the monsters, but this could be deadly.
- Once all pieces have been destroyed, the door opens.

 - [ ]  **Room of Elemental Rest**
>You are greeted by a harmonious blend of elemental forces, each contributing to an atmosphere of tranquil balance. To your left, an ornate fireplace houses a fire elemental, its flames dancing gracefully within the confines of the hearth, casting a warm, flickering light across the room. Opposite it, a beautifully sculpted fountain is alive with the playful movements of a water elemental, its fluid form leaping and splashing with a soothing sound. A gentle, refreshing breeze circulates through the space, courtesy of an air elemental that weaves around the room, carrying with it the faint scent of fresh rain. Subtle runes etched into the stone walls and floor glimmer faintly, their magic enhancing the natural tranquility of the room and inviting you to rest and rejuvenate amidst the elemental symphony.

- Fire elemental in an ornate fireplace, water elemental jumping around in a beautiful fountain, air elemental stirring up a cool breeze throughout the room, etc. Players can rest here (short rest only).
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "R".

##### 3: Giants

 - [ ]  **Giant Key**
>As you enter the chamber, you are immediately dwarfed by the sheer scale of the surroundings. Dominating the room is an enormous door, standing nearly three stories high, with a keyhole the size of a shield. Nearby, on a stone pedestal, rests a key that you would consider normal size, but is almost comically undersized in comparison to the massive lock it faces.

- Giant door with a normal sized key that needs to be enlarged in order to be used, or the lock can be picked with a DC 18 Sleight of Hand check. A successful DC 15 Investigation check reveals a spell scroll of *[[enlarge - reduce]]* on a giant-sized shelf.

 - [ ]  **Combat or Social Encounter**
>A hulking humanoid sits in the middle of the room. This giant retains a look of daunting power despite its stooped bearing, tattered clothing, and pieces of slapdash armor strapped on wherever it fits.

- Degenerate titans are prone to insanity and unexpected mood shifts, and are fiercely territorial creatures. This lair is filled with items scavenged from around the labyrinth - a hodgepodge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.
- The titan is extremely hungry, as he has not eaten for days, and will attack anyone who enters the chamber almost immediately. But it's possible the players could talk him down and avoid a full fight.

`encounter: 1: Degenerate Titan`

 - [ ]  **Giant Living Room**
>You find yourself in an enormous living space, furnished with items of staggering proportions. A colossal fireplace crackles with a roaring fire, its flames licking the air almost as high as the ceiling, casting a warm, inviting glow across the room. Around the fireplace, massive chairs and a sofa, each large enough to fit an entire adventuring party, are arranged in a cozy semicircle. The thick, plush carpet underfoot and the towering bookshelves filled with giant-sized tomes add a touch of homely comfort, although scaled far beyond the norm for your smaller statures.

- This room looks like a comfortable living room, but all of the furniture is sized for giants. The players can rest here (short rest only).
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "S".

##### 4: Fiends

 - [ ]  **Sentient Door**
>Before you stands a towering door, crafted from dark, aged wood that seems to absorb the light around it. Intricate carvings of grotesque faces and fiendish figures twist across its surface, their expressions contorted in silent screams and mocking laughter. Two of these figures emerge from the door and appear almost alive - one a demonic visage with a large iron ring through its ears, and the other a devilish face with a similar ring through its mouth. As you approach, the door creaks slightly, and the air fills with a low, ominous rumble.

* This sentient door can't be opened through normal means (i.e. not lock-picked or broken down), but the rings going through the figures serve as knockers, which will open the door if both are used at the same time.
* The encounter should start with the left figure (the demon) yelling: "It's very rude to stare!", followed by the right figure (devil) mumbling something that's indecipherable with the ring in its mouth, and the left figure saying: "Don't talk with your mouth full!". This will likely encourage a party member to take the ring from its mouth, working against their need to use the knockers, but also making conversation with the figures easier since the other figure can't hear a word they say.
* Conversation may continue as the party chooses, with the figures using any various mean insults (including the examples below) that seem appropriate. But the only way to get through the door is to "knock and the door will open". Either figure resists the ring being placed back (if removed) though, requiring a DC 12 Strength check to return it.

>"Ah, what have we here? A band of misfits hoping to pass? The last group was at least twice as intimidating and half as foolish."

>"Do you always look this unprepared, or is today a special occasion for incompetence?"

>"I've seen goblins with better strategy and kobolds with more charm. What hope have you?"

>"Oh, please, tell me more about your adventures — I need a good laugh!"

>"Are you trying to enter, or is this some sort of pitiful performance? It's hard to tell with amateurs."

>"Let's play a game of wit! Oh, nevermind, I see you're already at a disadvantage."

>"If ignorance is bliss, you lot must be the happiest adventurers alive."

>"You couldn't negotiate your way out of a paper bag, let alone through me."

>"I suppose you think you're worthy to pass. Many have thought the same; none have been right."

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**
>An immense creature sniffs at the air. Most of its head is covered by a helmet from which one baleful eye gazes out. Its muzzle fuses flesh and machinery, and sharp metal teeth glint from under its lips. Roll initiative!

`encounter: 1: Psoglav Demon`

 - [ ]  **Fiendish Sitting Room**
>As you step into the room, a sudden warmth envelops you. The room is lit by flickering torches set in sconces along the walls, casting long, dancing shadows that play tricks on your eyes. The air is thick with the scent of brimstone and the faint, unnerving sound of distant, muffled whispers. Plush, dark velvet cushions are scattered around a low, black marble table, inviting you to rest.

- The players can rest here (short rest only).
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "T".

##### 5: Monstrosities / Beasts

 - [ ]  **Man of Stone**
>As you enter the room, your gaze is immediately drawn to a striking scene at its center: a statue of a man, frozen in a moment of tense contemplation, stares directly at another statue—a menacing basilisk, its eyes wide and seemingly ready to strike. The details of both figures are exquisitely carved, capturing the urgency and peril of their eternal standoff. Hanging around the man’s neck is a key, also petrified and melded into the stone of his figure, rendering it unreachable.

- The party arrives in a room with a statue of a man in the middle. He is looking directly at a statue of a basilisk. The characters notice the key to the door needed to continue is around his neck, but is also made of stone and they can't take it. They must figure out that you have to find a way to block their line of sight (like cover the man's eyes with a cloth), the man comes back to life and gives you the key, he can be used as a guide to the rest of the dungeon.
- The man is Serelath (see Rest Room below for more), and they party may choose to converse when him here, or he'll initiate a conversation in the rest room. He will flee from combat into the rest room if the players fight with the Bukavac.

 - [ ]  **Combat Encounter**
>You cautiously enter a cavernous chamber, its air damp and heavy with the scent of stagnant water. The center of the room is dominated by a large, murky pool, its surface still and reflecting the dim light from moss-covered stones. Jagged rocks and twisted roots jut out around the edges, casting eerie shadows that dance across the water. Suddenly, the deceptive calm is shattered by a bone-shattering roar as a monstrous creature emerges from the depths. This grotesque, frog-like beast, with two gnarled horns and wicked claws, surges forward on six powerful legs, water cascading off its mottled skin. Its eyes, wild and predatory, fixate on you with a hunger that chills your blood. Roll initiative!

`encounter: 1: Bukavac`

 - [ ]  **Rest Room**
>As you step away from the dangers of the pool and into the adjoining room, you find a sanctuary crafted within a natural cavern. The room is spacious, with the ceiling arched high above, supported by rough-hewn stone pillars. Here, the natural rock formations create a series of small alcoves, each outfitted with simple yet sturdy wooden benches covered with thick, fur pelts that provide a surprisingly comfortable place to rest. Gentle light filters through cracks in the ceiling, illuminating patches of lush, soft moss that carpet the floor, giving the space a serene, almost garden-like atmosphere despite its subterranean setting. In one corner, a small spring bubbles quietly, its clear water collecting in a shallow stone basin, inviting you to refresh and replenish. The walls are adorned with primitive, yet artful carvings of various beasts and monstrosities.

- Opportunity to have a conversation with Serelath. He carries a bag of holding filled with his treasures, including various works of art, antiquities, books, finery, and magic items that he will refuse to ever part with. Serelath will also do his best to hide any draconic mannerisms (which is difficult for him, and he moves with an almost feline grace) and make sure no one learns about his true form. He will also be elusive with any information about himself, simply saying he came from a land far away (saying Seren Island if pushed, but this is not true) and happened upon the labyrinth during his adventures.
- The players can rest here (short rest only).
- A glowing runic symbol here, discovered with a DC 12 Investigation check, is reminiscent of the Common letter "L".

>**Serelath:** _(Stretching his limbs and taking a deep breath)_ "Ah, to feel the flow of air and not be merely a part of the decor! My thanks, travelers. I am Serelath, though once I wandered these paths as Serelath the Seeker, a humble explorer of hidden realms."

>**Serelath:** "You have my gratitude for breaking the enchantment that held me captive. It's been... a long while since I've been able to move of my own accord. Time loses meaning when you're part of the scenery."

##### 6: Steel Millitaur Chamber

 - [ ]  **Phantom Doorway**
>As you advance through the dimly lit corridors of the labyrinth, you arrive at what seems to be a straightforward wooden door, its surface plain and unadorned, standing in stark contrast to the ornate and complex designs you've encountered so far. The air here holds a peculiar, metallic tang, and a faint humming sound resonates as if the very walls pulse with concealed energy.

- When the players encounter the phantom doorway, it appears to be a mundane door, indistinguishable from any other in the dungeon. However, when opened and entered, the doorway's magic is triggered, transporting the character to a location different within the labyrinth (rolling a d6 and going to that appropriate chamber, with a 6 leading to the Central Chamber Final Battle below).
- To detect the true nature of the Phantom Doorway, the players must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 16) or use a spell like *[[detect magic]]* or *[[identify]]*. If they successfully discern the door's illusory nature, they can attempt to dispel the enchantment or find an alternative means of bypassing the doorway.

 - [ ]  **Central Chamber Final Battle**
>As you step through the phantom doorway, the clanging of metal greets your ears, echoing off the cavernous walls of a vast chamber hewn from solid rock. The air is thick with the smell of oil and cold iron, and the floor vibrates slightly underfoot, as if machinery churns in the bowels of the earth. At the center of the room stands the guardian — a towering minotaur, its body forged from gleaming metal, each muscle and sinew meticulously crafted. In its hands, it wields two massive greataxes that catch the sparse light, casting menacing shadows. The taste of metal lingers on your tongue, and the chill of the stone seeps into your bones, setting the stage for battle.

- This final battle is likely pretty straightforward, where the minotaur's HP may already be partially depleted from any previous encounters with it.

`encounter: 1: Metal Minotaur`

 - [ ]  **Treasure**

- Maybe a magical double headed axe? Possibly the vestige for Shahiri?
- Minotaur's Maze Amulet sounds fun (created by ChatGPT), but might be OP (with Maze being an 8th level spell).
	- This intricate amulet is crafted from the same metal as the Minotaur guardian. It features a miniature labyrinth design that constantly shifts and changes. Once per day, the wearer can cast maze without requiring a spell slot. Additionally, the wearer gains advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or restrained.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* At this point the PCs should have command words for: Giants, Monstrosities or Beasts, Undead, Fey or Plants, and Celestials. That means we need to give the command words for Aberrations, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals or Oozes, and Fiends (or not use these creature types at all in this dungeon). We probably won't use Aberrations at all, and will likely save the command word for Dragons for later (likely the Crystal Library).
* The Lantern should be influenced by the magic of the labyrinth and turn on automatically, to whatever appropriate color, whenever a creature is nearby. This can be overridden if a command word is spoken, so the players can still check for creatures if they'd like.
