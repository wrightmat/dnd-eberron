### Background and Hook(s)

* The Map of Sphinx Sightings has a few visible markings indicating sightings in the area.
* Father Beldrok should direct the players to a nearby Temple that's dedicated to the Sovereign Host, and seems to be the epicenter of the few sphinx sightings here.

### Characters and Locations

* **Durgan** (Taurosphinx)
* **Brouvuck "Beerhand" Mroranon** (CN male dwarf veteran). The black sheep of the most influential clan of the Mror Holds, Beerhand prefers to keep to himself in the remote Frostmantle, where he runs the tavern. (gruff, with slight Chicago accent)
* **Hulda Kolkarun** (NN female dwarf artificer). Alchemist who runs the magic shop in Frostmantle. Hulda is recognized for her groundbreaking work in creating potions and elixirs that are specifically tailored to the harsh conditions of the Mror Holds, including potions to protect against both extreme heat and extreme cold that be found in the mountains.
* **Father Beldrok Ironbrow** (NG male dwarf cleric). Father Beldrok is a sturdy and resilient middle-aged dwarf with a warm smile, deep-set brown eyes, and a thick beard interwoven with silver threads that speak to his years of service. Beldrok's hands are rough and calloused from years of labor before he joined the clergy, revealing his humble origins and his continued practice of combining physical work with spiritual service. Before his calling to serve the Sovereign Host, Beldrok was a skilled blacksmith known for his exceptional work in crafting ceremonial weapons and armor. He occasionally returns to the forge, believing that the act of creation is a form of worship, blessing his creations with prayers for strength and protection.
* **Garrick Quickfinder** (CG male halfling scout). The charismatic and somewhat mysterious owner of The Vault. Garrick is a middle-aged halfling with a keen eye for detail and a knack for acquiring items that are as unique as they are useful. He dresses in an eclectic mix of styles, reflecting the diverse nature of his inventory, and always wears a smile that suggests he knows something you don't. His shop is cluttered yet organized, with every item having its own story, which he collects just as diligently as the items themselves.

* **Frostmantle**
* **Lair of the Honorable Guardian**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [x]  **Frostmantle** (nearby town)

>You enter the town of Frostmantle, greeted by the bustling activity of its streets, where a lively array of taverns, stores, shrines, and workshops line the thoroughfares. The air hums with the sound of commerce, echoing the town's reputation as a hub of trade and enterprise within the Mror Holds. Amidst the backdrop of majestic mountains and serene lake waters, Frostmantle stands as a beacon of opportunity and refuge in the heart of dwarven territory.

One of very few surface settlements in the Mror Holds, the town of Frostmantle is actually not incorporated into any clan hold, making it uniquely neutral among the dwarves. It is considered a haven for fugitives and outlaws, as well as the clanless, who either never had a clan to begin with, voluntarily cast aside their clan, or were exiled from their homes.

Positioned near one of the Mror Hold’s major land and maritime trading routes, being less than an hour by foot to the nearest tributary of Mirror Lake, and a week’s trip by caravan to the central dwarven port of Lake Home. Frostmantle, not only has a secure place as a trading outpost, but also boasts a somewhat lucrative local industry in the mining of silver ore. Attributes that have attracted both a sizeable amount of trade and travellers to the settlement. As a result of this, Frostmantle hosts a modest but considerable number of taverns, stores, shrines, and workshops should residents or passersby require their many goods and services on offer.

* **Beerhand’s Beds, Beer, and Bread**. Tavern and Inn, run by "Beerhand" Mroranon.
	* [[Food and Drink]]
	* Draconic Ales Sampler: A collection of four ales, each brewed with an ingredient significant to a particular type of dragon (e.g., a hint of sulfur for a black dragon ale, a smidge of gold dust for a gold dragon ale). While mostly a novelty, each ale offers a minor, temporary benefit related to its dragon's abilities (see [[Draconic Factions#DM Notes and Random Tables]] for full list) lasting for 1 hour.
	* `dice: [[Draconic Tribes#^random-dragon-color]]`
* **The Ironbrow Smithy**. Blacksmith and Armory, which is usually run by an apprentice while the actual Blacksmith, Father Beldrok, is at the Temple.
* **Hulda’s Herbal Cures and Alchemical Curses**. Alchemist and Magic Shop, run by Hulda Kolkarun.
* **The Vault**. Frostmantle's premier destination for general goods, curios, and the occasional rare item that no one else seems to be able to find.
	* [[Shop - The Vault]]
* **Temple of the Sovereign Host**. This temple is already teaching the Thir beliefs and is adorned with draconic symbology. The Priest, Father Beldrok, is a leader of the Order of the Ruby Scale.
* **Kundarak Bank**. 

 - [x]  **Approaching the Temple**

>As you approach the temple, you feel a palpable sense of reverence washing over you, carried on the crisp mountain air. Towering stone pillars rise like ancient sentinels, their weathered surfaces bearing the weight of countless ages, and faded writing. At the entrance, intricate carvings depict scenes of dwarven valor and lore, hinting at the deep connection between the denizens of the Mror Holds and the Sovereigns. The air is tinged with the faint scent of smoldering embers.

* Chiseled on each of the pillars is one of the Core Beliefs of the Sovereign Host:
	* The Sovereigns are always present. For example, whenever a forge is fired, Onatar stands beside it.
	* The Sovereigns shape the world and their hand is in all things. No proof is needed, for the proof is in the world.
	* Each Sovereign must be honored at their proper place and time.
	* The Sovereigns give strength and guidance to those who listen, and instinct and intuition are their voices. When one is heard most clearly, that one should be followed.

 - [x]  **The Three Faces of Coin**

* **Kol Korran**, Onatar, and Kol Turrant (The Keeper)
* Kol Korran, the Sovereign of World and Wealth, guide and protector for traders and travelers and supporter of fair negotiation.
* Onatar, the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He inspires all who create and aids artificers, craftsmen, and smiths.
* The Keeper, The Sovereign of Death and Decay, represents greed and gluttony.

>As you step into the chamber, you're greeted by the glint of gold coins piled at its center, shimmering in the faint light. A towering statue looms over the treasure, depicting a cheerful fat dwarf with outstretched hands and closed fists. A door on the other end of the room has two slots, one on each side. Murals all over the walls depict cheerful fat dwarves trading and bartering, dwarven smiths creating things, and skeletal dragons stealing and eating.

* At least two coins must somehow be obtained to place into the coin-shaped slots on either side of the door, in order to open it. The statue is of Kol Korran, which any player with a DC 10 History check would know (with additional knowledge about him revealed with any higher rolls).
* Players may succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check to try and steal coins, or they could roll a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Kol Korran to give them the coins (which he does by opening his hands revealing two coins). Offering an item for trade to the statue will also cause it to open its hands.
* Failure on the Deception check to steal coins results in a combat encounter with an avatar of The Keeper (as a skeletal lesser death dragon at half HP).

`encounter: 1: Lesser Death Dragon` (half HP)

 - [x]  **The Three Faces of War**

* **Dol Dorn**, Dol Arrah, and Dol Azur (The Mockery)
* Dol Dorn, the Sovereign of Strength and Steel, the patron of the ordinary soldier. He represents bravery, strength, skill at arms, and aids those who wield weapons.
* Dol Arrah, the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice. She represents wisdom in battle and is patron of those who seek justice, fight with honor, and make sacrifices for others.
* The Mockery, the Sovereign of Betrayal and Bloodshed, represents dishonorable combat and unjust war.

>As you enter the chamber, your eyes are drawn to the imposing figure of a muscular dwarf standing at its center, a mighty weapon held aloft in its stone grasp. Surrounding the room, racks of weapons of every kind gleam in the dim light. Murals all over the walls depict muscular dwarves bravely wielding weapons, half-elves shining with holy radiance fighting for justice, and half-fiend pale red dragons engaged in dishonorable combat.

* The statue in the center of the room depicts Dol Dorn holding a weapon. A player must wield any weapon and present it to the statue, causing it to mirror the players' actions. Rolling a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check causes the statue to stand down, dropping its weapon, which turns into a Potion of Healing.
* Failure results in Dol Dorn dropping his weapon, and blood dripping from the pale red dragons in the murals, which pools into a large dragonblood ooze.

`encounter: 1: Dragonblood Ooze`

 - [x]  **The Three Faces of Love**

* **Boldrei**, **Olladra**, and Szorawai (The Fury)
* Boldrei, the Sovereign of Hall and Hearth, is guide and protector of family and community and encourages folk to work together for the good of all.
* Olladra, the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune, the patron of entertainers, gamblers, and risk-takers. She bestows luck and spreads joy.
* The Fury, the Sovereign of Rage and Ruin, represents passion driven to extremes.

>As you step into the chamber, a warm glow fills the air, and the faint scent of roses wafts through the room. Two pedestals stand before you, with statues sitting on top of them - one of an older woman sitting in front of a hearth, and another of a young man playing a game. The door on the far side of the room has two indentations where it appears things could be placed. Murals all over the walls depict human commoners surrounded by their families around warm hearths, young halflings reveling and gambling, and raging snake-like wyrms with scales as dark as night.

* The door has indentations shaped like a hearth and a domino. Closer examination of the statues reveals a stone hearth as part of one and a stone domino as part of the other.
* When any player approaches a statue, the creature part of it (either human or halfling) seems to come to life, asking the player to engage with them in some way. If the player agrees to tell the human statue all about their family or community, she will hand over the stone hearth. If the player agrees to play a game with the halfling, then they can win his domino if they beat him on a straight luck check.

 - [x]  **Three Faces of Knowledge**

* **Onatar**, Aureon, and the Shadow
* Onatar, the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He inspires all who create and aids artificers, craftsmen, and smiths.
* Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Believed to be the first wizard, he revealed the secrets of magic to the world.
* The Shadow, the Sovereign of Magic and Mayhem, is the literal shadow of Aureon that attained sentience and godhood as a price paid by Aureon for arcane knowledge.

>As you step into the chamber, you find yourself surrounded by towering bookshelves lining the walls, each laden with ancient tomes and scrolls. In the center of the room is a stone forge with a statue of a dwarven smith above it. A grand tapestry hangs at the far end, depicting dwarven smiths working over lit foundries, gnome wizards practicing magic, and sinister shadowy dragons weaving between them. Beyond the tapestry is a huge door surrounded by strange looking symbols.

* The nine symbols around the door are representations of the Sovereign Host, and each will light up when a fact about the Sovereign is spoken aloud in the room. Once all nine symbols are lit, the door opens.
* If the forge in the center of the room is lit, a spectral version of the same statue creature appears next to the forge. The statue can be asked any question, and convinced to give an accurate answer with a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
* Alternatively, players can make Intelligence (History) checks to recall any facts they might know about the Sovereign Host. Starting with DC 8 (revealing one fact), a new fact is revealed for every +2, in order of the list below.
* If anything stupid is done, such as burning books to start the forge, then the players are attacked by an avatar of The Shadow.

 - [x]  **The Three Faces of The Wild**

* Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (The Devourer)
* Arawai, the Sovereign of Life and Love, the patron of fertility. She represents the benign side of nature and brings good weather and bountiful harvests.
* Balinor, the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt, the patron of those who follow the border between nature and civilization. He guides hunters and wild beasts alike.
* The Devourer, the Sovereign of Wave and Whelm, represents the raw destructive power of nature.

>As you enter the chamber, the air is filled with the soothing sounds of a gentle breeze rustling through unseen foliage, accompanied by the soft chirping of crickets and the distant call of what sounds almost like birds. Cave paintings on the wall depict halflings tending fertile fields, crude but good-natured half-orcs hunting wild beasts, and dragon turtles tearing things apart with their massive teeth, claws, and tails. In the center of the room lies a sprawling pit, shrouded in shadows and echoing with the hisses of unseen creatures.

* Once any player approaches the pit, a Spirit Naga wearing a Red Dragon Mask emerges!
* Players may attempt a DC 15 Charisma (Animal Handling) check to charm the snake, with success allowing them to grab the mask without getting bit, and failure resulting in the naga attacking.
* Alternatively a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check could be made if using a players' own instrument (adding their proficiency as appropriate).

`encounter: 1: Spirit Naga`

 - [x]  **Chamber of the Honorable Guardian**

>As you step into the final chamber, a hushed reverence fills the air, punctuated by the steady beat of powerful wings and the deep rumble of a distant growl. Before you stands a magnificent creature bearing the head of a dwarf, crowned with majestic horns, atop the muscular body of a bull. Massive wings spread wide from its broad shoulders, casting imposing shadows across the chamber.
>"In the forge of tradition and faith, the truest character is tempered. Your charisma has been tested, and you have been found worthy. I am at your service," the sphinx says, while bowing deeply.

* Durgan should fill in any lore about the red dragons, others in the region, or anything the players would like to know about.
