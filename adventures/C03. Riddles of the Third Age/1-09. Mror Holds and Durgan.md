### Background and Hook(s)

* The Map of Sphinx Sightings has a few visible markings indicating sightings in the area.
* 

### Characters and Locations

* **Durgan** (Taurosphinx)

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Frostmantle? (nearby town)

* 

 - [ ]  Finding the Temple

* Outside the temple should be statues that depict the Core Beliefs of the Sovereign Host.

Core Beliefs
* The Sovereigns are always present. For example, whenever a forge is fired, Onatar stands beside it.
* The Sovereigns shape the world and their hand is in all things. No proof is needed, for the proof is in the world.
* Each Sovereign must be honored at their proper place and time.
* The Sovereigns give strength and guidance to those who listen, and instinct and intuition are their voices. When one is heard most clearly, that one should be followed.

* Charisma: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion

 - [ ]  **The Three Faces of Coin**

* **Kol Korran**, Onatar, and Kol Turrant (The Keeper)
* Kol Korran, the Sovereign of World and Wealth, guide and protector for traders and travelers and supporter of fair negotiation.
* Onatar, the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He inspires all who create and aids artificers, craftsmen, and smiths.
* The Keeper, The Sovereign of Death and Decay, represents greed and gluttony.

>As you step into the chamber, you're greeted by the glint of gold coins piled at its center, shimmering in the faint light. A towering statue looms over the treasure, depicting a cheerful fat dwarf with outstretched hands and closed fists. A door on the other end of the room has two slots, one on each side. Murals all over the walls depict cheerful fat dwarves trading and bartering, dwarven smiths creating things, and skeletal dragons stealing and eating.

* At least two coins must somehow be obtained to place into the coin-shaped slots on either side of the door, in order to open it. The statue is of Kol Korran, which any player with a DC 10 History check would know (with additional knowledge about him revealed with any higher rolls).
* Players may succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check to try and steal coins, or they could roll a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Kol Korran to give them the coins (which he does by opening his hands revealing two coins). Offering an item for trade to the statue will also cause it to open its hands.
* Failure on the Deception check to steal coins results in a combat encounter with an avatar of The Keeper (as a skeletal lesser death dragon).

`encounter: 1: Lesser Death Dragon`

 - [ ]  **The Three Faces of War**

* **Dol Dorn**, Dol Arrah, and Dol Azur (The Mockery)
* Dol Dorn, the Sovereign of Strength and Steel, the patron of the ordinary soldier. He represents bravery, strength, skill at arms, and aids those who wield weapons.
* Dol Arrah, the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice. She represents wisdom in battle and is patron of those who seek justice, fight with honor, and make sacrifices for others.
* The Mockery, the Sovereign of Betrayal and Bloodshed, represents dishonorable combat and unjust war.

>As you enter the chamber, your eyes are drawn to the imposing figure of a muscular dwarf standing at its center, a mighty weapon held aloft in its stone grasp. Surrounding the room, racks of weapons of every kind gleam in the dim light. Murals all over the walls depict muscular dwarves bravely wielding weapons, half-elves shining with holy radiance fighting for justice, and half-fiend pale red dragons engaged in dishonorable combat.

* The statue in the center of the room depicts Dol Dorn holding a weapon. A player must wield any weapon and present it to the statue, causing it to mirror the players' actions. Rolling a successful DC 15 Intimidation check causes the statue to stand down, dropping its weapon, which turns into a Potion of Healing.
* Failure results in combat of some sort, obviously.

 - [ ]  **The Three Faces of Love**

* **Boldrei**, **Olladra**, and Szorawai (The Fury)
* Boldrei, the Sovereign of Hall and Hearth, is guide and protector of family and community and encourages folk to work together for the good of all.
* Olladra, the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune, the patron of entertainers, gamblers, and risk-takers. She bestows luck and spreads joy.
* The Fury, the Sovereign of Rage and Ruin, represents passion driven to extremes.

* Puzzle and rest space?

 - [ ]  **Three Faces of Knowledge**

>The walls of this hall are adorned with colorful banners and heraldic emblems depicting the noble houses of old. A grand tapestry hangs at the far end, depicting heroic deeds and ancient battles. The room resonates with the echoes of past glory, inviting you to prove your worthiness in the eyes of the ancestors.

* **Onatar**, Aureon, and the Shadow
* Onatar, the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He inspires all who create and aids artificers, craftsmen, and smiths.
* Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Believed to be the first wizard, he revealed the secrets of magic to the world.
* The Shadow, the Sovereign of Magic and Mayhem, is the literal shadow of Aureon that attained sentience and godhood as a price paid by Aureon for arcane knowledge.

* The players must decipher the meaning behind the heraldic emblems and banners, utilizing their charisma to convince the spirits of the noble houses that they are worthy of their legacy. This can involve making insightful connections between the symbols and the values they represent, or engaging in persuasive discourse with spectral guardians.
* The players must make a Performance or Religion check (DC 15) to successfully conduct the rituals with precision and reverence, invoking the blessings of the divine.
* Lighting the forge should provide a significant clue in this room. After all, whenever a forge is fired, Onatar stands beside it.

 - [ ]  **The Three Faces of The Wild**

* Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (The Devourer)
* Arawai, the Sovereign of Life and Love, the patron of fertility. She represents the benign side of nature and brings good weather and bountiful harvests.
* Balinor, the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt, the patron of those who follow the border between nature and civilization. He guides hunters and wild beasts alike.
* The Devourer, the Sovereign of Wave and Whelm, represents the raw destructive power of nature.

* Charisma (Animal Handling) check to do something like snake charming? Maybe a Naga?
