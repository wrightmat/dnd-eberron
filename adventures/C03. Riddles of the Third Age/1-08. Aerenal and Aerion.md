### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Some say that Aeren's journal contained not only the rituals that would come to shape elven life on Aerenal, but also a dedicated prophecy that Aeren gifted the founders of the island-nation. The myth states that this included a plan for the elves, which is at odds with the Draconic Prophesy, and that that is one of the purposes of the Undying Court.

### DM Notes

* Shae Cairdal is tailored toward Thana (Aerenal). Aerion's lair is tailored toward Verity (Arcane Trickster, so Int, but probably need to add some Dex based Rogue things as well).
* Possible location of The Moonsword Jungle
* Incorporate a Moonblade in the area somehow? http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:moonblade
