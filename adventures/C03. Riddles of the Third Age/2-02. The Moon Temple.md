### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Moon Temple Entry

 - [ ]  **The Jungle's Edge**

The players navigate the dense, shadowy outskirts of the Moonsword Jungle, encountering natural obstacles and signs of the jungle's magical nature. Their path leads to the temple's hidden entrance, guarded by Elyon.

Two DC 15 Survival checks will lead the party out of the jungle, with any failures resulting in a random encounter from the table below. If the moonkite transports a player somewhere, roll on the Planar Locations table.

`dice: [[2-02. The Moon Temple#^moonblade-encounter]]`

 - [ ]  **Entry Chamber** (New Moon)

>Ascending the weathered stairs to the temple, you're greeted by the scent of ancient stone mingling with the jungle's life. The architecture, a blend of elven elegance and the wild's raw beauty, frames an open ceiling where the night sky, dark with the new moon's phase, watches silently. A large tile beneath your feet mirrors this celestial absence, its surface a tapestry of blues and silvers that feels cool to the touch. Ahead, shallow stairs invite deeper exploration, their edges worn smooth by countless footsteps.

##### 2: Central Chamber

>As you step into an expansive chamber, your gaze is drawn to a serene stone pool at its heart, illuminated by a shaft of moonlight from above. Surrounding the pool, twelve large, ornately carved tiles rest on the edge, each depicting a moon of a different size and color. Radiating from the Moon Font are twelve short hallways, like spokes on a wheel, and at the end of each, an alcove in the floor stands empty, awaiting something to fill it.

The temple is circular, and composed of a large central chamber shaped like a full moon surrounded by an outer chamber which is composed of three moon chambers (crescent, half, and gibbous) on either side and a larger square chamber to the north. In the center of the large central chamber is a still fountain (the Moon Font). The chamber to the north contains an altar, and is the site of the final battle with the temple's guardian - a Young Moonstone Dragon.

Large floor tiles in every chamber depict a different phase of the moon. The tiles are movable, and will need to be collected in order to complete the temple (see Moonlit Sanctum below).

 - [ ]  **The Moon Font**

A large circular still fountain is the central feature of this large chamber.  Anyone drinking from the font transforms into a random lycanthrope until the next dark of the moon.
	1) Wolf
	2) Boar
	3) Rat
	4) Stag
	5) Bear
	6) Spider

A dozen large tiles are placed on the perimeter of the font, each depicting a moon of a different size and color.

 - [ ]  **Moon Tile Puzzle**

Twelve short hallways radiate out from the central chamber, each terminating with an empty alcove on the floor, which could hold something like a large tile. The twelve tiles on the font need to be placed in the alcoves, but in the correct order, with Zarantyr being placed in the north alcove and the moons radiating in order around the room from there.

Any incorrectly placed tiles result in a beam of moonlight striking the player placing the tile, casting *[[moonbeam]]* on the area.

When the tiles are placed in the correct order, two doors open on each end of the chamber (at 3:00 and 9:00) leading to the Outer Chambers.

Around the room are scattered several stones which outline an ancient Elven chant in four parts. Each piece can be found with an Investigation or Perception check, with the DC starting at 15 and increasing by 3 (maxing out at 24). Alternatively, if a player asks how much they know about the order of the moons, they can perform a History check, with the same DCs, giving the same number of correctly ordered moons as below.

>_"Zarantyr's storm, a pearly gleam,
Olarune's gaze, an orange dream.
Therendor's grace, in palest gray,
Guides the lost upon their way."_

>_"Eyre's forge, in silver's light,
Dravago's chill, winter's bite.
Nymm's crown, in yellow bright,
Leads the path through darkest night."_

>_"Lharvion's eye, a watcher keen,
Barrakas shines, in white so clean.
Rhaan's pages, a pale blue seen,
Whisper secrets, 'twixt and between."_

>_"Sypheros's shadow, a smoky veil,
Aryth's fire, with orange-red sail.
Vult guards the end, in pockmarked gray,
Marks the close, and a new day."_

##### 3: Outer Chambers

 - [ ]  **Whispered Secrets** (Left Half Moon Chamber)

>As you step into the dim chamber, the sound of your movement stretches and distorts, echoing back at you as if from a great distance. Shadows dance along the walls, their forms shifting and whispering secrets and lies that weave around you like a chill breeze. To the south, just past a large tile on the floor that depicts a half moon, a shallow staircase descends into darkness. Dominating the chamber, four imposing trees stand sentinel, each bearing a door within its trunk, silent and inscrutable, offering no clue as to what lies beyond.

The players enter a hall where their movements and spells echo unnaturally. Shadows flit across the room, whispering constantly; however, some whispers seek to mislead or confuse. A staircase in the south goes down to another chamber (the Left Crescent Chamber below). Four large trees in the room each have a door carved into them, with no indication of where each leads.

Players must discern which whispers to trust to find the way through, relying on a DC 15 Insight check to find the correct exit. Success results in the players finding the door leading to the chamber next to The Moonlit Sanctum (Left Gibbous Chamber), while failure results in them ending up in a random location - roll a d4, with one through three resulting in the location in the Planar Locations table (where they remain for one minute of real time before being teleported back), and a four leading to the Left Gibbous Chamber.

Perception checks can be used to collect additional information from the shadows. Allude to the Moonstone Dragon fight later, and subduing it rather than killing it. Any of the whispers below could be used (have the player being whispered to roll a d6).

| d6  | Whisper                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | "Be wary of the pool's silver embrace, for its kiss carries the wild's untamed fury."                                                                                                             |
| 2   | "On a night of fire and despair, your bond of blood was severed, leaving a powerful force in its wake."                                                                                           |
| 3   | "Four guardians rooted in secret lore, each door a path to realms untold, where the power of the moons hold sway."                                                                                |
| 4   | "Bound by moonlight, the guardians watch, their vigil eternal, their duty sworn, to protect the blade, the pool, and the secrets forlorn."                                                        |
| 5   | "In the chamber where moonstone's light fills the air, a guardian fierce with scales that gleam. Battle with courage, but spare your final strike, for only mercy can unlock the blade of dream." |
| 6   | "Seek the phases in the stone, from darkest night to brightest day. In their order, power is shown, and the Moonblade's heart shall sway."                                                        |

 - [ ]  **Rest Chamber** (Left Crescent Chamber)

>As you step into the darkness, you find a quiet sanctuary marked by crumbling menhirs that encircle a singular, large tile on the ground, depicting a crescent moon with a faint glow. The ancient stones appear to have worn writing on them.

This chamber contains no dangers to the players, but houses several crumbling menhirs. A successful Investigation check may reveal any of the following odes/chants, depending on how good the roll is. The first (about the Moon Pool and its power to grant lycanthropy) is revealed with a DC of 10, and the second and third (about the power of elven souls) are revealed with a DC of 15 and 20 respectively.

>_"In ages past, when shadows cast, A darkness o'er the land,
The lunar guardians made their stand, By the Moon Pool's hand.
Its waters pure, its intent sure, To protect the realm from blight,
By giving rise to lycanthrope's might, Under the moon's pale light."_

>_"In the shadow of the boughs, beneath the moon's soft light,
We dance the dance of the Deathless, eternal as the night.
Our souls, like stars in Irian's sky, a power pure and bright,
Against all darkness, we stand, with all our might."_

>_"Bound by choice, not by chain, to Aerenal we give our light,
In the moon's temple, our oath remains, a beacon against the night.
Let not the dragon's fiery breath, nor shadow's cold embrace,
Steal away the soul's own power, or its luminous grace."_

 - [ ]  **Possessed Pillar** (Left Gibbous Chamber)

>As you enter this sparsely adorned chamber, your eyes are immediately drawn to an imposing statue on a raised platform in the center. Carved from dark stone that seems to absorb the light around it, the statue depicts a figure with the body of an elf but the head of a wolf, its eyes set with moonstone that glimmers in the dim light. Notably, a metal key hangs tantalizingly from a chain around the statue's neck, its metallic gleam stark against the dark stone. The only door out of the room is closed, with nothing but a small keyhole adorning it.

The only thing in this chamber is an animal-headed statue on a raised platform. If any player touches the statue, any metal objects they carry are claimed, and the statue comes to life to battle them. When the statue moves off of the platform, a large tile depicting a moon in a gibbous phase is revealed (or it can also be seen with a DC 15 Investigation check).

Unfortunately for any adventurers, the door to the east is locked with a key, and that metal key is stuck to the statue.

 - [ ]  **The Moonlit Garden** (Right Half Moon and Crescent Chambers)

>As you cautiously navigate deeper into the temple, a dense canopy overhead merges into an endless night, only a sliver of the half-moon visible through the rare gaps in the foliage above. The ground beneath your feet is lush with a carpet of vibrant, yet untamed, plant life that seems to drink in the shadows, leaving the area cloaked in a perpetual twilight. Dim light barely outlines the path ahead, which forks into two distinct directions: to the south, where the greenery thickens and seems to pulse with life, extending its embrace into another chamber; and to the north, where a faint, flickering light is barely visible.

>A grey humanoid wearing a dark tattered cloak and worn armor descends on glimmering, mothlike wings. In its hands it wields a halberd tipped with a cold light. Its black lidless eyes are filled with envy and sorrow.

This area is almost totally covered by a dense canopy, and plants cover the ground as well. A half moon can barely be seen in the sky above the garden, and effectively no moonlight pierces the vale, leading to dim light. The Lunarian that appears may move between this chamber and the Crescent Chamber to the south, but refuses to go north toward the flame.

`encounter: 1: Lunarian`

Hidden beneath the carpet of greenery is a tile depicting a half moon.

 - [ ]  **The Cleansing Cauldron** (Right Gibbous Chamber)

>Stepping into the next chamber, the oppressive darkness of the garden gives way to a warm, inviting glow emanating from a large cauldron at the room's heart. The fire within the cauldron burns with an intensity and hue unlike any ordinary flame; it bathes the room in a light that resonates with a deep, magical essence, akin to sunlight forged by arcane hands. Inscriptions etched into the cauldron's iron sides speak of purification and renewal. A large tile on the floor depicts a moon in a gibbous phase.

Fire burning in a cauldron here counts as magical sunlight. Any lycanthrope it burns is cured of their affliction.

If not found previously, the players should discover a book book containing the [[Lantern of Seeking]] command word for Fey or Plant here.

##### 4: Moonlit Sanctum (Full Moon)

 - [ ]  **The Moonstone Dragon**

>In the heart of the final chamber, where a large tile on the ground depicts a luminous full moon, stands a creature of unparalleled grace and elegance. Bathed in the soft, opalescent light of moonstone that lines the room, the dragon before you seems almost woven from the very essence of moonlight. Its scales shimmer in a breathtaking array of blues and silvers, complemented by ruffs of emerald-green fur that adorn its chin, chest, back, and tail, adding to its majestic presence. A slender crescent moon is formed by two delicate horns, one curving gracefully from the back of its skull and the other from the tip of its nose, embodying the celestial beauty and mystery of the moon itself. Just as you take all of this in, the dragon lunges at you!

As the players enter the full moon chamber to the north, a final guardian, a Young Moonstone Dragon, challenges the players. Victory requires them to subdue the dragon without destroying it, proving their worthiness to wield the Moonblade.

`encounter: 1: Young Moonstone Dragon`

##### 5: The Moonblade

 - [ ]  **The Final Puzzle**

>As the guardian fades from this realm, a spectral blade takes its place, its ethereal presence both captivating and elusive. The blade, shimmering with a ghostly light, seems just beyond the realm of the tangible, a prize that cannot yet be claimed. Your attention is drawn to eight circular alcoves that ring the room's perimeter; each is empty save for one, which cradles the tile depicting the full moon.

Upon defeating the guardian, the Moonblade reveals itself, but in a spectral form that cannot be claimed. At this point the players should be reminded (if needed) of the eight circular alcoves in the floor of the chamber. In order to claim the blade, they'll need to collect each of the moon phase floor tiles from around the temple and place them in the correct order (new, crescent, half, gibbous, full, gibbous, half, crescent) in the floor of this chamber.

 - [ ]  **The Blade's Awakening**

Once the tiles have been placed, the Moonblade becomes substantial. As Thana approaches, it awakens, and her parents' spirits communicate through it, offering blessings, revealing hidden truths about her heritage, and the blade's powers.

>Thana.... as the blade solidifies before your eyes, a warm, ethereal light envelops it, casting gentle shadows around the chamber. From within this luminance, the spirits of your parents emerge, their forms clear and radiant, filled with love and strength. They begin to address you directly, their voices intertwining in a harmonious echo that resonates deep within your soul.

>"Thana, our beloved daughter, in the moon's eternal glow, we find you once more. This Moonblade, a legacy of our lineage, now rightfully belongs to you. Let it guide you as we once tried, illuminating your path through the darkest nights."
>"Within you flows the courage and wisdom of countless generations, a heritage rich with power and responsibility. Your journey is a testament to our family's enduring spirit, and in embracing the Moonblade, you embrace your destiny."
>"This Moonblade wields powers as changeable as the night sky. Its strength will grow with you, granting you abilities as you increase your power. The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute. May its light guide you toward your true purpose, as you carve your path under the watchful gaze of the moons above. We are always with you, in every step, in every breath."
>As their message concludes, the spirits of your parents begin to fade, but their presence seems to linger in the warm glow of the Moonblade you now wield.

[[Moonblade (Vestige)]]

 - [ ]  **Plot Twist**

As the players leave the temple, Elyon re-appears and challenges the party again. He is suspicious of Thana's recent transformation, and questions whether she's truly worthy to claim the blade.
