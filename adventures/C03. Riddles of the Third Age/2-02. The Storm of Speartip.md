### Background and Hook(s)

* Enraged at the loss of her favorite wyrmling, Kalryni is causing lightning storms (and opened a manifest zone to Kythri in order to bring in the Chaos Fleet) to destroy coastal settlements near Speartip Island and refuses to stop until someone delivers the adventurer responsible (Horget Black, now a ghost captain).

### Characters and Locations

* **Kalryni** (CN female blue dragon). The leader of the blue dragons.
* **Horget Black** (CN male former human ghost ranger). Former High Prince (and therefore rival of Ryger), who originally welcomed House Thuranni to the region. He is now a ghost captain of the area around Speartip Island.
* **Magroth** (CG male changeling-slaad ranger). Captain of the Chaos Fleet, and infected by the Chaos Phage from a slaad, but is only partially turned as long as he remains on the Material Plane. He captains the flagship *Magna Tyrannis*.
* **Prince Lorrister** (LG male aasimar ranger/paladin). One of the baron lords of the Lhazaar Principalities. Prince Lorrister commands the Heavenly Fleet, the smallest of the Lhazaar fleets. Unlike the other baronies, which rely on piracy, Prince Lorrister seeks to bring justice to the Lhazaar Sea.

* **[[Regalport]]**
* **Speartip Island**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Maelstrom and the Chaos Fleet

 - [ ]  **Approaching the Maelstrom**

The players must navigate their ship through the violent lightning storms caused by Kalryni's wrath, avoiding natural hazards and the occasional skirmish with elements of the storm (and possibly the Chaos Fleet).

The Maelstrom Events random table incorporates a number of random events, including the Magical Storms table from Ghosts of Saltmarsh, randomly determined weather, and random appearance of ships or Kalryni herself. Once a set number of rounds (around 8?) has passed, then the ship reaches the eye of the storm where the Chaos Fleet ship is waiting for them.

`dice: [[2-02. The Storm of Speartip#^maelstrom-event]]`

 - [ ]  **Encounter with the Chaos Fleet**

>As your ship navigates through the tempestuous seas, the skies ominously clear, while the air crackles with arcane energy. Suddenly, you glimpse an imposing vessel at the heart of the storm: emblazoned with the name Magna Tyrannis. Its sails, as black as the void between stars, flutter wildly, and its hull, encrusted with pulsating crystals, seems to warp the very air around it. The ship looms like a predator among the waves, an embodiment of chaos itself, standing defiant in the eye of the storm.

This scene will likely either be a battle or a tense negotiation with the crown of the Chaos Fleet, the *Magna Tyrannis*. The crew, half-elemental beings bound with mephits, presents a unique challenge whether in combat or conversation. Either way, the important point to relay is that they have been brought here by Kalryni from Kythri to find her wyrmling that has gone missing, and that she believes a ghost captain known as Horget Black has it.

Ship-based combat in order to either destroy the Chaos Fleet ship, or board it in order to stop the storm. On the ship is a large artifact that radiates chaotic magical energy, and seems to be the focal point of the storm. If it's destroyed, then the storm ends and the players' ship can just leave the area without any trouble.

Any character in this scene may talk about their real purpose here, to serve as the focal point of the storm that will destroy the ghost ship that shelters Horget Black. The crew discovered that Horget is responsible for Kalryni's wyrmling's death, and so he must be completely destroyed. If the players choose to negotiate with or assist the Chaos Fleet, they propose a trial to test their allegiance to the Order of the Sapphire Scale's cause. They must find the ghost ship, and retrieve Horget Black himself, proving their worth and dedication.

**Magroth** (introduction)
>"Welcome, fools, to the eye of the storm. Here, in the chaos, we find our purpose, feeding the tempest to shatter the chains that bind our queen. The Order of the Sapphire Scale is the storm's edge, cutting through the calm to awaken the world. Will you stand with us, or be swept away?"

**Crew Member**
>"Every soul aboard has seen the truth in the tempest, the order within the chaos. The dragons' freedom is the key to our future."

**Magroth**
>"You've come far, but the journey ahead is wrought with peril. Know that the chaos you fear is the same chaos that will set us all free. You will not stand in the way of our quest to destroy the ghost ship."

##### 2: The Ghost Ship of Horget Black

 - [ ]  **Locating the Ghost Ship**

>As you sail away from the maelstrom, you catch only a glimpse of the night sky, and the unusually bright stars in it, before a grey mist rolls in over the water. All you can see are a few rocks jutting up from the water in front of you. On a particularly large boulder nearby, a beautiful siren is singing a song:
>"In darkness it starts and in darkness it ends. It burns as it rises and as it descends. The in-between places glow warmly, you know, but not like the apex, the highest it goes. Follow its path as it travels above, from start until finish, all colors thereof."
>Just as she finishes her song, the siren disappears, replaced by a pile of colorful orbs.

The siren dissolves into a pile of 11 crystal orbs, each of different colors: two dark purple, two red, two orange, two green, two blue, and one yellow. Players must decipher clues and solve the puzzle to navigate the ship to find Horget Black's ghost ship. A Perception or Nature check can reveal additional information about the area around the players:
- DC 12 reveals that the stars in the sky are still clearly visible in the sky despite the mists, they are unusually bright, and seem to be forming some sort of pattern.
- DC 16 reveals that the stars have different colors, and that those colors align with the colored orbs that have appeared.
- DC 20 reveals the exact pattern of colors as outlined in the solution below.

The solution is to place colored orbs, in order, on each of the rocks jutting out from the water that they'll see as they sail the ship deeper into the mists. The pattern mimics the sun's path from dawn until dusk (dark purple, red, orange, yellow, orange, red, dark purple). The green and blue orbs are not used. Once the orbs are all placed, the mists clear slightly to reveal the ghost ship (with mists remaining all around the ship to set the mood).

>As your vessel cuts through the dense, grey mists that blanket the waters, an eerie stillness settles around you. Suddenly, the mists begin to part like curtains drawn back by unseen hands, revealing the ghostly silhouette of an ancient ship. Its timeworn sails hang limp and tattered, and the creaking wood sounds the ship's age with every gentle rock of the waves. The air grows colder, and a faint, otherworldly light emanates from the deck, casting ghostly shadows that dance just beyond your sight. This spectral visage, suspended in a timeless haze, waits as if it has been expecting you.

 - [ ]  **Communicating with Horget Black**

>As you approach the ghostly deck of the ship, a chill runs through the air, and a spectral figure materializes before you. Wearing the tattered remnants of what was once a regal uniform, the ghostly figure bows slightly, a gesture of respect from a time long past.
>"Ah, living souls brave enough to tread upon the deck of the damned. I am Horget Black, once High Prince of Lhazaar, now but a whisper on the wind and a warden to this spectral vessel. To what do I owe the rare pleasure... or is it misfortune... of your company?"

Once aboard the ghost ship, the players must figure out how to communicate with the incorporeal ghost, uncovering his story and convincing him to return with them to Kalryni. Horget Black is the former High Prince (and therefore rival of Ryger), who actually found the wyrmling already wounded (after he fell from the sky onto his ship) and tried (but failed) to nurse it back to health, due to his being an incorporeal ghost. This is a straight role-playing challenge, where the players may try to convince Horget to accompany them.

**Horget Black** (if asked about the wyrmling)
>"Many moons ago, amidst a storm that raged like the heavens themselves were at war, a creature of magic and might fell from the skies onto this very deck. A wyrmling, blue as the deepest ocean and wounded beyond my means to mend. As a ghost, my touch passes through flesh and bone, leaving me with no powers to heal or harm.
>I endeavored to save the creature, using what little knowledge and resources a phantom could muster. Alas, my efforts were in vain, and the creature perished, its last breath a storm that seemed to weep for the loss. And for that failure, the Order of the Sapphire Scale hunts me, believing me a murderer of their precious charge."

##### 3: The Heavenly Fleet's Intervention

 - [ ]  **Ambush by the Heavenly Fleet**

>Just as you're starting to make progress, a shadow falls over the ship. You look up to see the skies darken, not with clouds, but with an armada of ships descending upon you, their sails billowing with celestial light. The lead ship, adorned with sigils that shimmer like constellations, positions itself ominously above the ghost ship, casting you all in a foreboding shadow. With a flash of light, a winged aasimar appears on the deck, flanked by guards clad in armor that gleams with the light of the stars themselves.

Just as the players are making progress, Prince Lorrister and his Heavenly Fleet intervene, seeking to capture Horget for themselves. This could lead to a high-seas chase or a strategic battle.

**Prince Lorrister** (introduction)
>"Well, this is quite the gathering, isn't it? Never thought I'd find myself face to face with Horget Black, much less a crew brave — or maybe mad — enough to stand with him. I'm Prince Lorrister, in command of the Heavenly Fleet. We're not as big as the other fleets, but we sure make up for it in spirit.
>Horget, I've heard bits and pieces of your story. And you lot," he gestures to you, "seem to be caught up in this ghost's tale. Here's the deal — I'm after a bit of justice on these seas, not the cutthroat kind you're probably used to. Horget's got a bounty on his head, and I aim to collect. But I'm a fair man. Convince me there's a better way to settle this, and maybe we can work something out."
Lorrister's gaze sharpens, his celestial heritage clear in the intensity of his stare, yet his demeanor remains surprisingly approachable.
"Make it quick, though. The Heavenly Fleet doesn't linger, and neither do I. What's it gonna be?"

 - [ ]  **Negotiation or Escape**

As the players converse, the mists are starting to clear, revealing a large island on the horizon. The players must decide whether to negotiate with Lorrister, possibly using the information about Horget and the wyrmling as leverage, or find a clever way to escape.

The Heavenly Fleet has been commissioned by High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn to find the wyrmling (in order to save Regalport and the other Principalities from destruction).

##### 4: Confrontation with Kalryni

 - [ ]  **Braving the Island's Defenses**

>As your ship approaches the shores of the island, the sight before you is both awe-inspiring and foreboding. The island's jagged cliffs rise like titan's teeth against the sky, and dense foliage covers the land. Among the vibrant green, you notice something peculiar — palm trees lining the beach, moving with an unsettling, lifelike quality, their fronds rustling not just with the wind but with an eerie anticipation. These may be no ordinary trees...

Upon reaching Speartip Island, the players must bypass the formidable defenses set by the blue dragons and their allies, including battling or outsmarting the local animated plant life. The Ravenala prefer to avoid conflict, but are fiercely protective of their Morphoi kin. The Morphoi harbor a powerful animosity toward intelligent animal life, and attack the minute that the party touches foot on the island.

`encounter: 1d4: Ravenala, 1d8: Morphoi`

 - [ ]  **The Meeting with Kalryni**

>As you navigate deeper into the heart of Speartip Island, the dense jungle thins to reveal a vast clearing. At its center, surrounded by scorched earth and ancient ruins that hint at a bygone era of power, lies Kalryni. This great blue dragon reclines with a majestic, almost regal posture, her scales shimmering with hues of stormy sea and lightning. Her eyes, electric and piercing, fix upon you as you approach.
>Kalryni shifts slightly, the air around her crackling with lightning as she speaks.
>"Ah, what curious creatures have wandered into my domain? I'm Kalryni. I must admit, you're quite the puzzle. What do you eat when you can't hunt with claws or fly to your prey? And your skin — does it not tear without scales to protect it? Fascinating..."
>Her gaze intensifies, fixing on you with a sharpness that suggests her curiosity could turn dissective at a moment's notice.
>"And speaking of mysteries, perhaps you can solve one for me. I've lost something very dear to me — a wyrmling, not unlike myself but much smaller. Have you seen such a creature? It would be... unfortunate to dissect something so rare as yourselves without a good reason. Your tales might prove more interesting while you're still... intact."

A dramatic meeting with Kalryni, where players must use their diplomatic skills, evidence, and possibly Horget Black himself to persuade her to withdraw her storms and manifest zones.

**Kalryni** (if asked about the storms)
>"You know, stirring up storms is somewhat of a hobby of mine. Think of it as... gardening, but with the sky. The storms? Oh, they're just my way of sending a message, a rather loud one, admittedly. But it seems my whispers are too subtle for the likes of your kind.

**Kalryni** (concerning chaos)
>"The chaos you see, the storms that ravage these lands and seas, they are not mere displays of power or the whims of a bored dragon. They are the seeds of a new era, a necessary upheaval to clear the ground for draconic supremacy. In the tumult, the old, weak structures of power crumble, making way for the true rulers of this world to ascend."

##### 5: Conclusion and Reward

 - [ ]  **Private Audience**

After successfully negotiating with Kalryni and persuading her to cease her assaults, the adventurers may be led to a private audience with her within the depths of her lair within a cave on the island. The lair itself, adorned with lightning-charged artifacts and storm-themed treasures, serves as a testament to her power over the tempests. Kalryni, in a rare moment of openness, reveals her true motivation behind the seemingly random chaos.

>"Our goal is to destabilize, to distract, to weave a tapestry of chaos so intricate that even the most astute of nations would fail to see our true intent. The manifest zone to Kythri, the ley lines that crisscross beneath the earth like veins pulsing with arcane lifeblood — they are all conduits, channels through which we siphon the necessary magical energies to one focal point. This isn't some silly game; it's a calculated chance to shatter the barriers holding Tiamat at bay. In her return, we get the dawning of an era where dragons reign supreme, as it was in the First World."

With sufficient conversation or a great Insight check, Kalryni may confess a growing sense of unease, questioning the true price of Tiamat's return.

>Kalryni lets out a low chuckle, though the sound carries a hint of uncertainty this time. She shakes her massive head, almost as if amused by her own thoughts.
>"You know, plotting to wake up a God isn't all thunder and lightning. It's got me thinking... What happens when Tiamat says 'thanks' and decides she's not too keen on sharing the sandbox? I mean, sure, a world where dragons top the food chain again sounds great, but at what cost? I can't help but wonder if we're about to throw the party of the millennium and end up cleaning up an eternal mess.
>But hey. Right now I have a job to do. Try not to make yourself too comfortable."

 - [ ]  **The Dragon's Hoard**

>As Kalryni's massive form exits the cave, her departure stirs the air and sends a cascade of light dancing across the walls, drawing your eyes to the vast hoard that the dragon had been guarding. Amidst the glittering treasure, a particular item catches the light — a pair of dragon claws, their craftsmanship exquisite, lying atop the pile as if placed there for a purpose. The claws, shimmering with a faint light, seem to pulsate gently with a power that resonates the very air around you. A sudden breeze — unnatural in the stillness of the cave — whispers past, and for a moment, it feels as if the very essence of the sky is beckoning you closer.

Should Aither decide to take the claws, continue to the "Rewards and Aftermath" scene. Should she not, try using the text below. Or come up with a way to convince her.

>Aither, without warning, a vision fills your mind. The skies of Adar stretch out before you, vast and unending, the sacred blue dragons soaring with majestic grace. You feel a sense of home, of belonging, and a deep connection to these magnificent creatures that have always been revered in your homeland. The claws in front of you pulse with a familiar energy, echoing the power of the dragons you've held in awe since childhood.

 - [ ]  **Rewards and Aftermath**

When Aither dons the claws, read the text below. After she returns to consciousness, the dragon's hoard itself attacks!

>As you don the claws, a surge of energy courses through you, connecting instantly with your core. A calm, insightful voice speaks directly to your spirit: "Aither, these Dragon Claws are now yours, set to grow with you, enhancing your strikes with magical force. They are not mere weapons; they are partners on your path, evolving as you ascend."
>The claws shimmer with a purple light, signaling a deep, mystical bond. "As you walk the Way of Mercy, these claws will extend your will, each hit resonating with the ancient power of dragons. Your affinity for the air and the lore of the blue dragons of Adar are echoed in their essence. Moreover, as you master your ki, these claws will become conduits, occasionally restoring your inner energy when you need it most, a testament to the unity between your martial discipline and the draconic legacy."
>The voice gently recedes, leaving a promise hanging in the air. But your vision is interrupted by a sudden pain in your arm!

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Speartip Island was the original landing site of Lhazaar when she arrived in Khorvaire, and is now a site of interest for the blue dragons and their leader Kalryni.
 - [ ]  The Chaos Fleet has been selected by Kalryni to find the wyrmling, while the Heavenly Fleet has been commissioned by High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn to do the same (in order to save Regalport and the other Principalities from destruction).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* The Chaos Fleet is a crew that slips in and out of Kythri, and should be kind of like Davy Jones' crew from Pirates of the Caribbean if turned half-elemental instead of half-fish. Each crewmember is infected with a slaad and only half converted while on the material plane, and each has an elemental companion in the form of various types of mephits (on their shoulders like parrots). All of the fleet are members of the Order of the Sapphire Scale, with Magroth as the leader of the faction.

Whenever a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. `dice:[[Magic#^wild-magic-surge]]`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3          | Shadow Fog rolls in. When a vessel travels through this oppressive, shadow-haunted miasma, its crew and passengers feel despair. Each hour a vessel is immersed in the fog, the crew must make a quality score check by rolling a d20 and adding their quality score to the number. The DC for this check is 10 + the number of hours the ship has been immersed in the Shadow Fog. If the crew fails this check, their quality score decreases by 1 while within the Shadow fog and for one day afterward. |
| 4          | Ghost Fog rolls in. Every hour a ship is immersed in ghost fog, roll any die. On an even number, `encounter: 2d4: Specter` (hostile) appear and attack those on the ship. If a humanoid creature dies in ghost fog, its spirit rises as a specter that is hostile toward all creatures that aren't undead. All non-undead creatures immersed in ghost fog are vulnerable to necrotic damage.                                                                                                                |
| 5          | Lightning strikes the ship, causing `dice:1d8` lightning damage. DC 14 Dexterity save to avoid taking damage (but the ship always takes it). A failure of 5 or more results in that character being Stunned for `dice:1d4` rounds. A critical hit (8 on the damage die) results in the ship catching fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6          | A wave crashes against the ship, rocking it back and forth. DC 12 Strength save, or fall prone and take `dice:1d6` bludgeoning damage from the water. Any officer knocked prone uses their full action to get up on their next turn, unless assisted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7          | A whirlpool appears directly under the ship. Whirlpools are difficult terrain. Roll a `dice:d4` to determine its rank (and see Ghosts of Saltmarsh, pg 206, for details).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8          | A current appears near the ship, carrying the ship with it. Roll a `dice:d8` to determine the direction, and a `dice:d6` to determine the speed (multiplied by ten, in feet per round). The current remains for `dice:1d4` round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9          | Wind changes direction and/or speed. Roll a `dice:d8` to determine the direction, and a `dice:d6` to determine the speed (in miles per hour).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 10         | The Chaos Fleet ship appears in the distance. It moves toward the players' ship, seemingly unimpeded by the storm, at its full speed on every round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11         | The Ghost Ship appears in the distance. It remains stationary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12         | A pale azure blue dragon is seen flying overhead, performing impressive aerial maneuvers, and creating gusts of wind with its powerful wings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | **Abjuration**. A storm infused with abjuration magic repels ships, as if protecting something in the sea. Right before the storm ends, a ship within it is teleported `dice:5d20` miles in a random direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2         | **Conjuration**. When conjuration magic churns within a storm's heart, creatures of wind and rain emerge from distant realms to attack anything they encounter. The ship encounters `encounter: 1d3: Air Elemental` (hostile).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3         | **Divination**. When divination magic seeps into a storm, howling winds and residual whispers temporarily scramble the knowledge of a ship's crew; for `dice:1d3` days, the ship's crew suffers disadvantage on all quality checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4         | **Enchantment**. Storms infused with enchantment magic disarm a creature's sense of danger, enthralling mariners and causing them to speed into danger. During the storm, any checks made to resolve hazards or manage the ship are made with disadvantage.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5         | **Evocation**. These ferocious storms are wracked with thunderbolts, driving sheets of acid rain, exploding meteors, and other dangers. After each day of the storm, every component aboard the ship takes `dice:1d10` fire, `dice:1d10` acid, and `dice:1d10`lightning damage. In addition, roll a d20 and add the crew's quality. On a 10 or less, the crew's quality decreases by 1, and `dice:1d6` members of the crew are killed. |
| 6         | **Illusion**. A storm brimming with illusions poses little direct harm to a ship, but experienced navigators know it poses an insidious threat. During the storm, the ship travels in a random direction that isn't its intended course.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 7         | **Necromancy**. Ghosts howl and whirl in this storm's wind, while the remains of long-dead mariners stir in their watery graves. During the storm, `encounter: 1d4: Specter, 2d4: Ghoul, 4d6: Zombie` emerge from the waves to attack the ship.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 8         | **Transmutation**. These violently unpredictable storms cause the waves to warp and twist. The storm transforms the water around the ship into an amalgamation of ice, stone, and stranger materials, making travel difficult and damaging the ship. The ship's hull takes `dice:4d10` bludgeoning damage, and the ship's speed decreases by half during the storm.                                                                    |
