### Background and Hook(s)

* Enraged at the loss of her favorite wyrmling, Kalryni is causing lightning storms (and opened a manifest zone to Kythri in order to bring in the Chaos Fleet) to destroy coastal settlements near Speartip Island and refuses to stop until someone delivers the adventurer responsible (Horget Black, now a ghost captain).

### Characters and Locations

* **Kalryni** (CN female blue dragon). The leader of the blue dragons.
* **Horget Black** (CN male former human ghost ranger). Former High Prince (and therefore rival of Ryger), who originally welcomed House Thuranni to the region. He is now a ghost captain of the area around Speartip Island.
* **Magroth** (CG male changeling-slaad ranger). Captain of the Chaos Fleet, and infected by the Chaos Phage from a slaad, but is only partially turned as long as he remains on the Material Plane. He captains the flagship *Magna Tyrannis*.
* **Prince Lorrister** (LG male aasimar ranger/paladin). One of the baron lords of the Lhazaar Principalities. Prince Lorrister commands the Heavenly Fleet, the smallest of the Lhazaar fleets. Unlike the other baronies, which rely on piracy, Prince Lorrister seeks to bring justice to the Lhazaar Sea.

* **[[Regalport]]**
* **Speartip Island**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Maelstrom and the Chaos Fleet

 - [ ]  **Approaching the Maelstrom**

The players must navigate their ship through the violent lightning storms caused by Kalryni's wrath, avoiding natural hazards and the occasional skirmish with elements of the Chaos Fleet.

Random table?

 - [ ]  **Encounter with the Chaos Fleet**

A battle or a tense negotiation with a scouting vessel of the Chaos Fleet. The crew, half-elemental beings bound with mephits, presents a unique challenge whether in combat or conversation.

Ship-based combat

##### 2: The Ghost Ship of Horget Black

 - [ ]  **Locating the Ghost Ship**

Players must decipher clues and navigate through the storm to find Horget Black's ghost ship, using a combination of skills, magic, and wits to pierce the veil between realms.

Some sort of tracking skill challenge? Look for inspiration.

 - [ ]  **Communicating with Horget Black**

Once aboard the ghost ship, the players must figure out how to communicate with the incorporeal ghost, uncovering his story and convincing him to return with them to Kalryni.

Horget Black is the former High Prince (and therefore rival of Ryger), who actually found the wyrmling already wounded (after he fell from the sky onto his ship) and tried (but failed) to nurse it back to health, due to his being an incorporeal ghost.

Straight role-playing challenge with the additional setback of having to find and communicate with the ghost.

##### 3: The Heavenly Fleet's Intervention

 - [ ]  **Ambush by the Heavenly Fleet**

Just as the players are making progress, Prince Lorrister and his Heavenly Fleet intervene, seeking to capture Horget for themselves. This could lead to a high-seas chase or a strategic battle.

High seas chase!

 - [ ]  **Negotiation or Escape**

The players must decide whether to negotiate with Lorrister, possibly using the information about Horget and the wyrmling as leverage, or find a clever way to escape.

##### 4: Confrontation with Kalryni

 - [ ]  **Braving the Island's Defenses**

Upon reaching Speartip Island, the players must bypass the formidable defenses set by the blue dragons and their allies, including battling or outsmarting Morphoi and Ravenala.

 - [ ]  **The Meeting with Kalryni**

A dramatic meeting with Kalryni, where players must use their diplomatic skills, evidence, and possibly Horget Black himself to persuade her to withdraw her storms and manifest zones.

##### 5: The True Threat

 - [ ]  **The Revelation**

After successfully negotiating with Kalryni and persuading her to cease her assaults, the adventurers are led to a private audience with her within the depths of her lair on Speartip Island. The lair itself, adorned with lightning-charged artifacts and storm-themed treasures, serves as a testament to her power over the tempests. Kalryni, in a rare moment of openness, reveals her true motivation behind the seemingly random chaos.

Kalryni explains that her actions, though appearing malicious and driven by grief, are part of a larger strategy orchestrated by the topaz dragons. The continuous storms and the manifest zone to Kythri were not just an expression of rage but a calculated move to destabilize the region, sow discord among the nations, and distract the world's powers from the true threat looming on the horizon: the ritual to release Tiamat. The chaos created serves as both a cover for the topaz dragons’ activities and a means to gather necessary magical energy, which is being funneled through the manifest zones and ley lines across Khorvaire to a central point, aiding in weakening the barriers between Tiamat’s prison and the material world.

Kalryni admits to believing that the return of the Dragon Queen would usher in an era where dragons regain their rightful dominion over Eberron. However, she may also confess a growing sense of unease, questioning the true price of Tiamat's return.

 - [ ]  **Plot Twist**

Kalryni’s unease and the information she provides could serve as a double-edged sword. While the adventurers have gained a powerful ally in Kalryni, her fears hint at dissent among the dragons themselves. This internal conflict could be leveraged by the adventurers in future endeavors to thwart the topaz dragons' plans, suggesting that not all dragons support the return of Tiamat and that alliances within their ranks may be more fragile than they appear.

 - [ ]  **Rewards and Aftermath**

The players are rewarded by both Kalryni and potentially other factions for their efforts. The resolution with Horget Black could also provide unique rewards, such as secrets of ghostly navigation or an alliance with his spectral crew.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Speatip Island was the original landing site of Lhazaar when she arrived in Khorvaire, and is now a site of interest for the blue dragons and their leader Kalryni.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* The Chaos Fleet is a crew that slips in and out of Kythri, and should be kind of like Davy Jones' crew from Pirates of the Caribbean if turned half-elemental instead of half-fish. Each crewmember is infected with a slaad and only half converted while on the material plane, and each has an elemental companion in the form of various types of mephits (on their shoulders like parrots). All of the fleet are members of the Order of the Sapphire Scale, with Magroth as the leader of the faction.
* The Chaos Fleet has been selected by Kalryni to find the wyrmling, while the Heavenly Fleet has been commissioned by High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn to do the same (in order to save Regalport and the other Principalities from destruction).
* Monsters: Ravenala (ToB1), Morphoi (ToB1), Shimmer Seal (ToB2)
