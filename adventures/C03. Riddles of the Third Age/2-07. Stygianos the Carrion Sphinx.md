### Background and Hook(s)

* The lair of a fallen sphinx, a gypsosphinx (or creature of death and carrion), is hidden in the Endworld Mountains.
* Reigney directs the players toward this general area on a mission to conquer this sphinx (his sibling).
* The players may decide to start with any of the three nearby town scenes below, who will give them some information about the Gypsosphinx.

### Characters and Locations

* **Stygianos** (NE male gypsosphinx).
* **High Priest Ixion** (NE male human priest). Chief priest and the primary caretaker of the Gypsosphinx. Ixion is an elderly human with sharp, piercing eyes and a commanding presence. His hair is completely white, and his robes are adorned with symbols of the gypsosphinx, skulls, and mystical sigils. He walks with a silver staff topped with a miniature replica of the temple. Ixion serves as the primary guide for visitors, offering cryptic advice, and can initiate them into deeper mysteries of the temple. He also controls access to the most sacred areas of the temple.
* **Maelis, the Keeper of Bones** (NE male elf wizard). The temple's necromancer and caretaker of the Arena of Bones. Maelis is a middle-aged elf with a gaunt face, marked by a life spent among the dead. His hands are always stained with grave dirt, and his robes are simple, practical, and hooded. Maelis has a pragmatic view of death and sees it as an essential aspect of life. He is less philosophical than Ixion and more focused on the practical applications of necromancy. He is curious about the properties of life and death and is constantly experimenting. Maelis can provide insights into necromantic practices, offer quests related to acquiring rare components for rituals, and acts as a judge during combats in the Arena of Bones.
* **Cenara, the Silent Harbinger** (NE female half-elf rogue). Silent sentinel and envoy of the Gypsosphinx, responsible for silent vigilance and conveying the will of the sphinx to the priests and visitors. Cenara is a shrouded figure, always seen wearing a long, dark cloak that obscures most of her features. Only her eyes, glowing faintly with a ghostly light, are visible beneath the hood. Cenara communicates without speaking, using gestures or writing in the air with a finger that leaves a trail of phosphorescent light. She embodies the aura of death and mystery, always present yet barely noticeable, her presence felt more as a chilling whisper in the air.

* **[[Karrlakton]]**
* **[[Loom Keep]]**
* **[[Gatherhold]]**
* **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]**
* **Endwall Mountains**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Tracking the Sphinx

 - [ ]  **[[Karrlakton]] or [[Loom Keep]]** (Karrnath)

* Escher in Loom Keep has been entreating the creature to reveal the time and place of his death, hoping to ensure his immortality. He has been bringing payment in the form of human corpses. But the sphinx has yet to reveal its exact location, and he's been leaving the corpse scraps at the foot of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Gatherhold]]** (Talenta Plains)

* The halflings of Gatherhold have seen the sphinx flying overhead at night. They have also found dead dinosaurs across the desert during their hunts. The trail appears to head toward the south end of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]** (Q'barra)

* The people of Wyrmwatch, Hope have benefitted from the nearby sphinx lair, as time doesn't pass normally there. The same people have been running the community for over fifty years, but don't seem to be aware of it because they never leave. They believe the sphinx to be a celestial servant or reflection of the Silver Flame, and they worship it when it flies overhead.
* Most residents know that the sphinx's lair is on the east side of the Endwall Mountains, somewhere north of Wyrmwatch.

##### 2: Finding the Sphinx's Lair

 - [ ]  **Navigating the Endwall Mountains**

* It takes three DC 15 Survival checks in order to find the sphinx's lair, with any failures leading to a random encounter. But for each piece of information obtained from one of the above locations, one necessary Survival check is eliminated, so it's possible to get there without any checks.

 - [ ]  **The Entrance Riddle**

* Upon entering the temple, the players are greeted by a large statue of the gypsosphinx, which poses a riddle that hints at themes of death, transformation, and the cycle of life. The correct answer drops a wall of force and grants access into the temple.
* If the players attempt to leave or answer incorrectly, the statue animates and attempts to trap them within the temple's entrance chamber, believing them unworthy. Overcoming this challenge requires clever thinking, possibly convincing the sphinx of their worth through debate or outsmarting it with a trick.
* Once the players answer the riddle correctly, the wall of force moves from the door leading deeper into the temple to the door leading outside - trapping the players here.

>I live where there is light, but I die if it shines on me. What am I?
(A shadow)

##### 3: The Ceremonial Entryway

- This temple is primarily a long hallway that descends down into the earth, where the gypsosphinx will be found. Along the way, various rooms tempt the players with trials that grant them treasure or boons.

 - [ ]  **Ritualistic Banquet Hall**

- A lavish dining area where spectral figures feast. Large tables are set with countless plates of broad beans, pork, barley bread, and oysters. Visitors might be invited to join, but eating the food could have dire consequences. All the food is laced with a narcotic compound, meant to contribute to the experience of the pilgrim visiting the temple.
- Anyone eating the food makes a DC 12 Constitution check. On a success, they gain a temporary boon that grants advantage on saving throws against being frightened and necrotic damage for the next 24 hours. On a failure, they become ill (stomach sickness), and have disadvantage on the same saving throws and necrotic damage.

 - [ ]  **Cleansing Chamber**
>As you step into a dimly lit antechamber, a small, ancient basin filled with shimmering water catches your eye. The water emits a soft, ethereal glow, inviting you to cleanse yourself. A large shuttered iron gate stands in front of you.

- A DC 10 Investigation check reveals an engraving on the bowl - "Cleanse yourself in preparation for the trials ahead".
- Characters must undergo a ritual cleansing using sacred waters found at the temple's entrance, involving a Wisdom (Religion) check to properly perform the rites. Once everyone has cleansed themselves, the iron gate opens.

 - [ ]  **Sacrificial Altar**

- Characters must choose whether to partake in the symbolic sacrifice of a sheep or an equivalent offering. Performing the sacrifice requires a DC 14 Constitution (Animal Handling) check to properly conduct the ritual. Success grants... a temporary boon?
- Cenara, the Silent Harbinger, guards this altar, but can only answer player questions with cryptic gestures.

##### 4: The Hall of Whispers

- Whenever a room is entered, the iron gate shutters, trapping the players inside. The only way out is to leave an offering (anything of value to the player) on a small bowl on the inside of each of the gates.

 - [ ]  **Philosophical Puzzles**

* The players navigate a hall filled with whispering sands that recount tales and philosophies of death and the desert. Interacting correctly with these tales reveals hidden paths or secret chambers filled with treasure or knowledge.

 - [ ]  **Priestly Parley**

* They encounter priests of the gypsosphinx, engaged in a ritualistic debate. Joining or influencing this debate with insights gained from the Hall of Whispers can earn the priests' respect, who might then offer aid or reveal shortcuts through the temple.

 - [ ]  **The Reflecting Pool**

- A dark chamber with a central pool showing visions of oneâ€™s death. The pool tests the resolve of the priests and visitors, confronting them with their mortality.

 - [ ]  **Deceptive Oasis**

* A seemingly lush oasis in the heart of the temple is revealed to be an illusion covering a pit of quicksand, home to a Sandwyrm. The players must navigate this perilous area, with the lantern possibly revealing the presence of the Sandwyrm.

 - [ ]  **The Undead Mirage**

* The oasis also hides entrances to underground chambers where Accursed Defilers and Anubians dwell. Discovering these chambers can lead to combat or bargaining with the undead, potentially uncovering secrets of the gypsosphinx or treasures it has hoarded.

 - [ ]  **The Arena of Bones**

- Description: A grim coliseum where visitors must fight reanimated skeletons or prove their worth through a necromantic ritual.
- Importance: Represents the physical and magical prowess the gypsosphinx respects and demands from its followers.

##### 5: The Court of Contemplation

 - [ ]  **The Petitioner's Chamber**

* A panel of priests outside of the gypsosphinx's chamber prevent interlopers from gaining access. Players will need to plead their case in order to gain access.

**Cryptic Questions**:
>"What is the price of eternal life if not the eternity of others' strife?"
>"How many deaths must the balance tip before the dragon's heart does rip?"
"Under what star does the obsidian dragon rest, and with whose demise will it rise best?"
"What rises with the moon but fears the dawn, where shadows converge and fates are drawn?"

**Chant Prayers**:
>"Hearts bound in mortal coil, release your hold, embrace the soil. Return to earth, to dark rebirth, find peace at last upon this hearth."
>"Through gates of bone and halls of dread, lead us where the living fear to tread. Guide our souls, forever roam, within your halls we find our home."
>"By the breath that withers, by the gaze that binds, unlock the secrets that the darkness finds. Let not our hearts fear the night, for in your truth we find the light."
>"Guide our steps through paths untold, guard our spirits, fierce and bold. In the night where shadows play, lead us where the spirits lay."

##### 6: Gypsosphinx's Challenge

 - [ ]  **The Gypsosphinx's Challenge**

* In a grand court, the players finally come face to face with the gypsosphinx itself, who challenges them not just to combat but to a duel of wits and wills, debating over topics of life, death, and purpose.
* Depending on the players' approach, this could lead to a direct confrontation with the sphinx, or a more nuanced resolution where they satisfy the sphinx's hunger for entertainment and reflection, possibly turning it into an ally or gaining its grudging respect.

##### 7: Conclusion

 - [ ]  **The Sphinx's Hoard**

Beyond the court lies the treasure vault, filled not just with material wealth but ancient knowledge collected by the gypsosphinx. Among these treasures is an item or tome that is key to the players' quest or reveals a new threat looming on the horizon.

 - [ ]  **A New Path**

As they leave, the players find that the temple has shifted, revealing a previously hidden path that leads directly into the heart of the Endwall Mountains. This path could lead to the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon?

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Monsters: Sandwyrm (ToB1, CR 6), Sand Silhouette (ToB1, CR 6), Accursed Defiler (ToB1, CR 4), Anubian (ToB1, CR 2), Cactid (ToB1, CR 3), Death Vulture (ToB2, CR 4) Gypsosphinx (ToB, CR 14)
* Possibly incorporate the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon as a powerful artifact opportunity.
* Just like Reigney's temple was based on the Greek apotropaic temple, this one is based on the Greek necromanteion temple.
* Ritual use of the Necromanteion involved elaborate ceremonies wherein celebrants seeking to speak to the dead would start by gathering in the ziggurat-like temple and consuming a meal of broad beans, pork, barley bread, oysters, and a narcotic compound. Following a cleansing ceremony and the sacrifice of sheep, the faithful would descend through a chthonic series of meandering corridors leaving offerings as they passed through a number of iron gates. The nekromanteia would pose a series of questions and chant prayers and the celebrants would then witness the priest arise from the floor and begin to fly through the temple.
* Gypsosphinx temples are where the sphinx is served by an order of priests who understand its hunger, entertain it with discussions of philosophy, butchery, and gossip, and know when to withdraw and leave their patron to silent contemplation. Such temples are often quite rich, as the gypsosphinx at its heart demands its priests live well, the better to reflect its own importance and status.
* Accompanied by flocks of vultures and often served by packs of gnolls, ogres, and hyenas, gypsosphinxes living in deserts, plains, hills, and even mountainous terrain often acquire a large number of followers and would-be helpers. This eventually leads a gypsosphinx to anger, as it requires some solitude and peace, and (depending on her mood) it will either abandon her entourage by casting greater invisibility and flying off, or it will turn them into a hearty meal by casting cloudkill. In either case, the survivors sometimes tell the tale of the creatureâ€™s wrath, discouraging others from following a gypsosphinx in search of wisdom.
