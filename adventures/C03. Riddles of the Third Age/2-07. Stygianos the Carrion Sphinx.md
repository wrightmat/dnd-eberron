### Background and Hook(s)

* The lair of a fallen sphinx, a gypsosphinx (or creature of death and carrion), is hidden in the Endworld Mountains.
* Reigney directs the players toward this general area on a mission to conquer this sphinx (his sibling).
* The players may decide to start with any of the three nearby town scenes below, who will give them some information about the Gypsosphinx.

### Characters and Locations

* **Stygianos** (NE male gypsosphinx).
* **High Priest Ixion** (NE male human priest). Chief priest and the primary caretaker of the Gypsosphinx. Ixion is an elderly human with sharp, piercing eyes and a commanding presence. His hair is completely white, and his robes are adorned with symbols of the gypsosphinx, skulls, and mystical sigils. He walks with a silver staff topped with a miniature replica of the temple. Ixion serves as the primary guide for visitors, offering cryptic advice, and can initiate them into deeper mysteries of the temple. He also controls access to the most sacred areas of the temple.
* **Maelis, the Keeper of Bones** (NE male elf wizard). The temple's necromancer and caretaker of the Arena of Bones. Maelis is a middle-aged elf with a gaunt face, marked by a life spent among the dead. His hands are always stained with grave dirt, and his robes are simple, practical, and hooded. Maelis has a pragmatic view of death and sees it as an essential aspect of life. He is less philosophical than Ixion and more focused on the practical applications of necromancy. He is curious about the properties of life and death and is constantly experimenting. Maelis can provide insights into necromantic practices, offer quests related to acquiring rare components for rituals, and acts as a judge during combats in the Arena of Bones.
* **Cenara, the Silent Harbinger** (NE female half-elf rogue). Silent sentinel and envoy of the Gypsosphinx, responsible for silent vigilance and conveying the will of the sphinx to the priests and visitors. Cenara is a shrouded figure, always seen wearing a long, dark cloak that obscures most of her features. Only her eyes, glowing faintly with a ghostly light, are visible beneath the hood. Cenara communicates without speaking, using gestures or writing in the air with a finger that leaves a trail of phosphorescent light. She embodies the aura of death and mystery, always present yet barely noticeable, her presence felt more as a chilling whisper in the air.

* **[[Karrlakton]]**
* **[[Loom Keep]]**
* **[[Gatherhold]]**
* **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]**
* **Endwall Mountains**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1. Finding the Sphinx

 - [ ]  **[[Karrlakton]] or [[Loom Keep]]** (Karrnath)

* Escher in Loom Keep has been entreating the creature to reveal the time and place of his death, hoping to ensure his immortality. He has been bringing payment in the form of human corpses. But the sphinx has yet to reveal its exact location, and he's been leaving the corpse scraps at the foot of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Gatherhold]]** (Talenta Plains)

* The halflings of Gatherhold have seen the sphinx flying overhead at night. They have also found dead dinosaurs across the desert during their hunts. The trail appears to head toward the south end of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]** (Q'barra)

* The people of Wyrmwatch, Hope have benefitted from the nearby sphinx lair, as time doesn't pass normally there. The same people have been running the community for over fifty years, but don't seem to be aware of it because they never leave. They believe the sphinx to be a celestial servant or reflection of the Silver Flame, and they worship it when it flies overhead.
* Most residents know that the sphinx's lair is on the east side of the Endwall Mountains, somewhere north of Wyrmwatch.

##### 1: The Sphinx's Lair

This temple is primarily a descent down into the earth, where the gypsosphinx will be found. 

 - [ ]  **Navigating the Endwall Mountains**

* It takes three DC 15 Survival checks in order to find the sphinx's lair, with any failures leading to a random encounter. But for each piece of information obtained from one of the above locations, one necessary Survival check is eliminated, so it's possible to get there without any checks.

 - [ ]  **The Entrance Riddle**

* Upon entering the temple, the players are greeted by a large statue of the gypsosphinx, which poses a riddle that hints at themes of death, transformation, and the cycle of life. The correct answer grants access into the temple.
* If the players attempt to leave or answer incorrectly, the statue animates and attempts to trap them within the temple's entrance chamber, believing them unworthy. Overcoming this challenge requires clever thinking, possibly convincing the sphinx of their worth through debate or outsmarting it with a trick.

 - [ ]  **Ritualistic Banquet Hall**

- A lavish dining area where spectral figures feast. Large tables are set with countless plates of broad beans, pork, barley bread, and oysters. Visitors might be invited to join, but eating the food could have dire consequences. All the food is laced with a narcotic compound, meant to contribute to the experience of the pilgrim visiting the temple.
- Anyone eating the food makes a DC 12 Constitution check. On a success, they gain a temporary boon that grants advantage on saving throws against being frightened and necrotic damage for the next 24 hours. On a failure, they become ill (stomach sickenss), and have disadvantage on the same saving throws and necrotic damage.

##### 2: The Hall of Whispers

 - [ ]  **Philosophical Puzzles**

* The players navigate a hall filled with whispering sands that recount tales and philosophies of death and the desert. Interacting correctly with these tales reveals hidden paths or secret chambers filled with treasure or knowledge.

 - [ ]  **Priestly Parley**

* They encounter priests of the gypsosphinx, engaged in a ritualistic debate. Joining or influencing this debate with insights gained from the Hall of Whispers can earn the priests' respect, who might then offer aid or reveal shortcuts through the temple.

 - [ ]  **The Reflecting Pool**

- A dark chamber with a central pool showing visions of oneâ€™s death. The pool tests the resolve of the priests and visitors, confronting them with their mortality.

##### 3: The Oasis of Decay

 - [ ]  **Deceptive Oasis**

* A seemingly lush oasis in the heart of the temple is revealed to be an illusion covering a pit of quicksand, home to a Sandwyrm. The players must navigate this perilous area, with the lantern possibly revealing the presence of the Sandwyrm.

 - [ ]  **The Undead Mirage**

* The oasis also hides entrances to underground chambers where Accursed Defilers and Anubians dwell. Discovering these chambers can lead to combat or bargaining with the undead, potentially uncovering secrets of the gypsosphinx or treasures it has hoarded.

 - [ ]  **The Arena of Bones**

- Description: A grim coliseum where visitors must fight reanimated skeletons or prove their worth through a necromantic ritual.
- Importance: Represents the physical and magical prowess the gypsosphinx respects and demands from its followers.

##### 4: The Court of Contemplation

 - [ ]  **The Petitioner's Chamber**

* A panel of priests outside of the gypsosphinx's chamber prevent interlopers from gaining access. Players will need to plead their case in order to gain access.

 - [ ]  **The Gypsosphinx's Challenge**

* In a grand court, the players finally come face to face with the gypsosphinx itself, who challenges them not just to combat but to a duel of wits and wills, debating over topics of life, death, and purpose.
* Depending on the players' approach, this could lead to a direct confrontation with the sphinx, supported by its Cactid guardians, or a more nuanced resolution where they satisfy the sphinx's hunger for entertainment and reflection, possibly turning it into an ally or gaining its grudging respect.

##### 5: The Treasure of Knowledge

 - [ ]  **The Sphinx's Hoard**

Beyond the court lies the treasure vault, filled not just with material wealth but ancient knowledge collected by the gypsosphinx. Among these treasures is an item or tome that is key to the players' quest or reveals a new threat looming on the horizon.

 - [ ]  **A New Path**

As they leave, the players find that the temple has shifted, revealing a previously hidden path that leads directly into the heart of the Endwall Mountains. This path could lead to the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon?

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Monsters: Sandwyrm (ToB1, CR 6), Sand Silhouette (ToB1, CR 6), Accursed Defiler (ToB1, CR 4), Anubian (ToB1, CR 2), Cactid (ToB1, CR 3), Death Vulture (ToB2, CR 4) Gypsosphinx (ToB, CR 14)
* Possibly incorporate the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon as a powerful artifact opportunity.
* Just like Reigney's temple was based on the Greek apotropaic temple, this one is based on the Greek necromanteion temple.
* Ritual use of the Necromanteion involved elaborate ceremonies wherein celebrants seeking to speak to the dead would start by gathering in the ziggurat-like temple and consuming a meal of broad beans, pork, barley bread, oysters, and a narcotic compound. Following a cleansing ceremony and the sacrifice of sheep, the faithful would descend through a chthonic series of meandering corridors leaving offerings as they passed through a number of iron gates. The nekromanteia would pose a series of questions and chant prayers and the celebrants would then witness the priest arise from the floor and begin to fly through the temple.
* Gypsosphinx temples are where the sphinx is served by an order of priests who understand its hunger, entertain it with discussions of philosophy, butchery, and gossip, and know when to withdraw and leave their patron to silent contemplation. Such temples are often quite rich, as the gypsosphinx at its heart demands its priests live well, the better to reflect its own importance and status.
* Open with a statue of a Gypsosphinx that presents them a riddle, then comes to life and traps the players when they try to leave (see White Plume Mountain, room 2 and "Escaping the Dungeon").
* Accompanied by flocks of vultures and often served by packs of gnolls, ogres, and hyenas, gypsosphinxes living in deserts, plains, hills, and even mountainous terrain often acquire a large number of followers and would-be helpers. This eventually leads a gypsosphinx to anger, as it requires some solitude and peace, and (depending on her mood) it will either abandon her entourage by casting greater invisibility and flying off, or it will turn them into a hearty meal by casting cloudkill. In either case, the survivors sometimes tell the tale of the creatureâ€™s wrath, discouraging others from following a gypsosphinx in search of wisdom.
