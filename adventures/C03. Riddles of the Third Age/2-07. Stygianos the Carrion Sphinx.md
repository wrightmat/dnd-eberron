### Background and Hook(s)

* The lair of a fallen sphinx, a gypsosphinx (or creature of death and carrion), is hidden in the Endworld Mountains.
* Reigney directs the players toward this general area on a mission to conquer this sphinx (his sibling).
* The players may decide to start with any of the three nearby town scenes below, who will give them some information about the gypsosphinx.

### Characters and Locations

* **Stygianos** (NE male gypsosphinx).
* **High Priest Ixion** (NE male half-elf priest). Chief priest and the primary caretaker of the gypsosphinx. Ixion is an elderly half-elf with sharp, piercing eyes and a commanding presence. His hair is completely white, and his robes are adorned with symbols of the gypsosphinx, skulls, and mystical sigils. He walks with a silver staff topped with a miniature ankh. Ixion serves as the primary guide for visitors, offering cryptic advice, and can initiate them into deeper mysteries of the temple. He also controls access to the most sacred areas of the temple.
* **Maelis, the Keeper of Bones** (NE male elf wizard). The temple's necromancer and caretaker of the Arena of Bones. Maelis is a middle-aged elf with a gaunt face, marked by a life spent among the dead. His hands are always stained with grave dirt, and his robes are simple, practical, and hooded. Maelis has a pragmatic view of death and sees it as an essential aspect of life. He is less philosophical than Ixion and more focused on the practical applications of necromancy. He is curious about the properties of life and death and is constantly experimenting. Maelis can provide insights into necromantic practices, offer quests related to acquiring rare components for rituals, and acts as a judge during combats in the Arena of Bones.
* **Cenara, the Silent Harbinger** (NE female half-elf rogue). Silent sentinel and envoy of the gypsosphinx, responsible for silent vigilance and conveying the will of the sphinx to the priests and visitors. Cenara is a shrouded figure, always seen wearing a long, dark cloak that obscures most of her features. Only her eyes, glowing faintly with a ghostly light, are visible beneath the hood. Cenara communicates without speaking, using gestures or writing in the air with a finger that leaves a trail of phosphorescent light. She embodies the aura of death and mystery, always present yet barely noticeable, her presence felt more as a chilling whisper in the air.

* **[[Karrlakton]]**
* **[[Loom Keep]]**
* **[[Gatherhold]]**
* **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]**
* **Endwall Mountains**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Tracking the Sphinx

 - [ ]  **[[Karrlakton]] or [[Loom Keep]]** (Karrnath)

* Escher in Loom Keep has been entreating the creature to reveal the time and place of his death, hoping to ensure his immortality. He has been bringing payment in the form of human corpses. But the sphinx has yet to reveal its exact location, and he's been leaving the corpse scraps at the foot of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Gatherhold]]** (Talenta Plains)

* The halflings of Gatherhold have seen the sphinx flying overhead at night. They have also found dead dinosaurs across the desert during their hunts. The trail appears to head toward the south end of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]** (Q'barra)

* The people of Wyrmwatch, Hope have benefitted from the nearby sphinx lair, as time doesn't pass normally there. The same people have been running the community for over fifty years, but don't seem to be aware of it because they never leave. They believe the sphinx to be a celestial servant or reflection of the Silver Flame, and they worship it when it flies overhead.
* Most residents know that the sphinx's lair is on the east side of the Endwall Mountains, somewhere north of Wyrmwatch.

##### 2: Finding the Sphinx's Lair

 - [ ]  **Navigating the Endwall Mountains**

* It takes three DC 15 Survival checks in order to find the sphinx's lair, with any failures leading to a random encounter. But for each piece of information obtained from one of the above locations, one necessary Survival check is eliminated, so it's possible to get there without any checks.

`dice: [[2-07. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx#^random-encounters]]`

 - [ ]  **The Entrance Riddle**

* Upon entering the temple, the players are greeted by a large statue of the gypsosphinx, which poses a riddle that hints at themes of death, transformation, and the cycle of life. The correct answer drops a wall of force and grants access into the temple.
* If the players attempt to leave or answer incorrectly, the statue animates and attempts to trap them within the temple's entrance chamber, believing them unworthy. Overcoming this challenge requires clever thinking, possibly convincing the sphinx of their worth through debate or outsmarting it with a trick.
* Once the players answer the riddle correctly, the wall of force moves from the door leading deeper into the temple to the door leading outside - trapping the players here.

>I live where there is light, but I die if it shines on me. What am I?
(A shadow)

##### 3: The Ceremonial Entryway

This temple is primarily a long hallway that descends down into the earth, where the gypsosphinx will be found. Along the way, various rooms tempt the players with trials that may grant them treasure, knowledge, or boons. If players die at any point in this temple, they're magically teleported to the Gypsosphinx's Lair. Any priests found in the temple (save for the named characters above) are adorned the same - non-descript and ragged grey robes, with a large hood that obscures their face.

 - [ ]  **Ritualistic Banquet Hall**
>As you step into a grand dining hall, the rich aroma of a lavish feast fills the air. Ghostly figures, translucent yet vividly detailed, are seated around large tables heaped with plates of broad beans, pork, barley bread, and oysters. At the head of the central table, an imposing figure with snow-white hair and robes decorated with arcane symbols, watches over the feast without partaking, his staff resting against his chair as he observes the spectral diners with a keen, discerning gaze.

- A lavish dining area where spectral figures feast. Large tables are set with countless plates of broad beans, pork, barley bread, and oysters. Visitors might be invited to join, but eating the food could have dire consequences. All the food is laced with a narcotic compound, meant to contribute to the experience of the pilgrim visiting the temple.
- High Priest Ixion is seated at one of the tables with the spectral figures, but doesn't eat. When the players leave the room, he silently follows them. When they reach the Court of Contemplation, he remains there.
- Anyone eating the food makes a DC 12 Constitution check. On a success, they gain a temporary boon that grants advantage on saving throws against being frightened and resistance to necrotic damage for the next 24 hours. On a failure, they become ill (stomach sickness), and have disadvantage on the same saving throws, frightened, and vulnerability to necrotic damage.

>"I am Ixion, the guide of this temple where the veil between life and death thins. Here, seekers once consumed meals to open their minds before descending into the temple's depths to commune with spirits. Have a seat if you wish, and prepare for your journey."

 - [ ]  **Cleansing Chamber**
>As you step into a dimly lit antechamber, a small, ancient basin filled with shimmering water catches your eye. The water emits a soft, ethereal glow, inviting you to cleanse yourself. A large shuttered iron gate stands in front of you.

- A DC 10 Investigation check reveals an engraving on the bowl - "Cleanse yourself in preparation for the trials ahead".
- Characters must undergo a ritual cleansing using sacred waters found at the temple's entrance, involving a DC 12 Wisdom (Religion) check to properly perform the rites, with failure resulting in disadvantage on any future checks in this temple related to rituals or religion. Once everyone has cleansed themselves, the iron gate opens.

 - [ ]  **Sacrificial Altar**
>As you enter a shadow-draped chamber, an open archway in front of you, your eyes are drawn to a dark-clad figure standing silently beside an ancient stone altar. Her eyes glowing faintly beneath the hood of her cloak, watching you with an intensity that feels almost tangible. Before her, on the cold altar, lies a sheep, quietly resting next to a sacrificial dagger.

- Characters must choose whether to partake in the symbolic sacrifice of a sheep or an equivalent offering. Performing the sacrifice requires a DC 14 Constitution (Animal Handling) check to properly conduct the ritual. Success grants a single use boon similar to the Charm of Nine Lives to a single player performing the sacrifice.
- Cenara, the Silent Harbinger, guards this altar, but can only answer player questions with cryptic gestures. She bows deeply if someone performs the sacrifice.

>[!info] Charm of Nine Lives
When you drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once used nine times, the charm goes away.

##### 4: The Hall of Whispers

Each of these is a similar non-descript stone room, with a large iron gate over an arched entrance. Whenever a room is entered, the iron gate shutters, trapping the players inside. The only way out is to leave an offering (anything of value to the player) on a small bowl on the inside of each of the gates. Players can approach them in order as they move down the hallway, or roll a d6 to approach randomly.

 - [ ]  **1. Numbered Golems**
>Five flesh golems are clustered against the north wall. Each has a number on its chest: 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Number 5 says, "One of us does not belong with the others. If you can pick it out, it will serve you, and the others will allow you passage. If you pick the wrong one, we will kill you. You have sixty seconds."

- The correct choice is 9, because it is not a prime number. Give the players an actual 60 seconds to figure it out.
- If the characters give the wrong answer, or try to leave the room by placing an offering in the bowl, roll initiative. The golems lumber forward to confront the intruders, trying to prevent anyone from moving through the gate.
- If the characters answer the riddle correctly, events unfold as promised: the golem numbered 9 becomes an ally of the party, accompanying the characters if they so desire, and the other four golems become inert again.

`encounter: 5: Flesh Golem`

 - [ ]  **2. Priestly Parley**

* The party encounters priests of the gypsosphinx, engaged in a ritualistic debate. Joining or influencing this debate with insights into the nature of life and death can earn the priests' respect, who might then offer aid or reveal shortcuts through the temple.

>As you navigate deeper into the temple's sanctum, the air thickens with the scent of ancient incense, mingling with the resonant tones of a philosophical debate. Ahead, three robed priests stand in a semi-circle, each animated by the fervor of their discourse.
>Priest 1: "Consider then that life is the chaos that dances upon the rigid structures of order. Is it not life's very nature to disrupt, to innovate, to defy the stagnation of the cosmos?"
>Priest 2: "Yet, without the order that death provides, returning all to the dust from whence it came, would life's dance not lose its meaning? Chaos unbound is destruction; order ensures renewal, a chance for life to flourish anew."
>Priest 3: "And so, is not the cycle of reincarnation the perfect embodiment of this balance? Each life is a note in the symphony of the universe, each death a rest between the movements, contributing to the eternal composition."
>As you draw nearer, they notice your presence and pause, their expressions shifting from intense debate to curious inquiry.
>One priest turns to you, addressing you with a measured gaze: "Ah, travelers, you've heard our musings. Tell us, what are your thoughts on the nature of life and death?"

>After considering your response, their faces light up with intrigued appreciation.
>Priest 2: "Ah, a fresh perspective! It seems the tapestry of thought is richer with each new thread."
>Priest 3: "Indeed, the insights from beyond our walls may yet illuminate the mysteries we ponder. Let us reflect on this further."
>Their conversation continues as you walk away.

 - [ ]  **3. The Reflecting Pool**
>The room is shrouded in shadows, with only a faint, eerie light emanating from a central pool. This pool, still and seemingly bottomless, mirrors the ceiling like dark glass, casting no reflection of your own figures. The air is heavy with a sense of foreboding, and a subtle, almost imperceptible hum resonates from the pool.

- A dark chamber with a central pool showing visions of one’s death. The pool tests the resolve of the priests and visitors, confronting them with their mortality.

| dice: 1d10 | Vision of Death                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Lost in a Storm: You see yourself lost at sea during a raging storm, calling for help that never arrives.                 |
| 2          | Battle's End: You are on a bloody battlefield, falling as you make a last heroic stand against a swarm of enemies.        |
| 3          | Betrayal: A close friend stands over you, a look of regret on their face as darkness encloses you.                        |
| 4          | Old Age: You are lying peacefully in your bed, surrounded by aged loved ones who are whispering goodbyes.                 |

| 6          | Falling: A vision of falling from a great height, the ground rushing up to meet you, wind roaring in your ears.           |
| 7          | Poisoned: At a grand feast, you suddenly clutch your throat, your face contorting in agony as the room spins.             |
| 8          | Monster's Feast: Torn apart by a terrifying creature, you face it with defiance in your final moments.                    |
| 9          | Disease: You are bedridden, your body wracked with disease, as you slowly fade away with each shallow breath.             |
| 10         | Sacrifice: You willingly step into the flames, a calm resolve on your face as you sacrifice yourself for a greater cause. |

 - [ ]  **4. Deceptive Oasis**
>As you step into the chamber, the air is fragrant with the fresh scent of blooming flowers and damp earth, and the gentle sound of trickling water soothes your senses. The ground underfoot is soft and sandy, and overhead, light filters through a canopy of lush leaves, casting dappled patterns that dance quietly around you.

* A seemingly lush oasis in the heart of the temple is revealed to be an illusion covering a pit of quicksand, home to a Sandwyrm. The room is 40 feet wide, with the entire space being quicksand, and the central 10 feet being taken up by the Sandwyrm. Initially, the Sandwyrm lies in wait, to Spine Trap any party members who come close. But if the players try to leave the room, the hungry Sandwyrm should move and attack.
* Each round, players must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or lose their footing and fall into the quicksand. Any creature in the quicksand moves toward the center of the pool, where the Sandwyrm resides, at 10 feet per round, while also sinking a number of feet based on the mechanics of quicksand (below). A player already submerged in quicksand does not need to make Dexterity saving throws.
* The quicksand is 15 feet deep, and any player reaching the bottom is teleported magically to the Gypsosphinx's Lair. Any player killed by the Sandwyrm is magically teleported to the Gypsosphinx's Lair.
* If the Sandwyrm is defeated, the quicksand stops moving and becomes a stationary sandy floor.

>As you step forward, the ground beneath your feet shifts unsettlingly, and the verdant paradise begins to shimmer and dissolve before your eyes, revealing a vast expanse of treacherous quicksand, and vultures circling overhead. Just as you realize the illusion, a low, menacing rumble vibrates through the air, and the sand stirs ominously, revealing a series of bone-like spines.

`encounter: 1: Sandwyrm`

>[!info] Quicksand
Any creature entering quicksand sinks 1d4 feet. At the beginning of each turn after sinking into quicksand, the creature sinks another 1d4 feet.
Provided the creature is not completely submerged, they can escape from the quicksand on a successful Strength check. The Strength check has a base DC of 10, then increases by 1 for each foot the creature has sunk.

 - [ ]  **5. The Arena of Bones**
>As you step into the coliseum, a vast circular arena unfurls before you, its air thick with the chill of necromantic energy. In the very center, a foreboding gate pulses with a dark, rhythmic throb, casting unsettling shadows across the stone floor. The oppressive silence is occasionally broken by the soft crunch of bone underfoot, hinting at ancient battles that have stained this ground. A middle-aged elf with a gaunt face, marked by a life spent among the dead, gestures you toward him.

- A grim coliseum where visitors must fight reanimated undead while attempting a ritual to close the gate to Mabar that is their source, all while avoiding bursts of necromantic energy from that negative energy plane. Represents the physical and magical prowess the gypsosphinx respects and demands from its followers The guantlet is overseen by Maelis, the Keeper of Bones. The room is a 50 foot diameter circular chamber, with the gate to Mabar in the center, and enough room outside of that to house the ritual components.
- Waves of undead enemies emerge from a central gate to Mabar. Starting with Skeletons (CR 1/4), then Shadows (CR 1/2), then Specters (CR 1), then Ghasts (CR 2).
- During combat, at Initiative 20, a burst of necromantic energy emerges from the gate to Mabar. Anyone within a 30 feet radius must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 2d6` necrotic damage and suffer disadvantage on their next turn. Characters can use spells or abilities to shield themselves or mitigate the damage.
- Ritual components are hidden in various parts of the coliseum, requiring Intelligence (Investigation) checks (DC 14) to locate (then placed in a random location by the DM), and avoiding the undead monsters to collect. Completing the ritual involves collecting all of the components, and then completing a sequence of an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 16) and a Wisdom (Religion) check (DC 18) to properly channel the energies.
	- **Essence of Shadow** (purple): A small vial containing a swirling dark mist that absorbs light around it.
	- **Crystalized Soul Shard** (red): A glowing crystal that pulses with a faint heartbeat, rumored to hold the soul of a long-forgotten hero.
	- **Banshee's Tear** (blue): A shimmering droplet that remains frozen at all times, encapsulating the essence of a banshee's last cry.
	- **Necromancer's Sigil** (green): An ancient rune inscribed on a stone tablet, pulsating with a dull necrotic energy.
- Upon successful completion of the ritual, instead of ceasing, the energy stabilizes and culminates in the release of a more powerful undead creature.

`encounter: 1d20+2: Skeleton`
`encounter: 1d12+2: Shadow`
`encounter: 1d8+2: Specter`
`encounter: 1d6+2: Ghast`

 - [ ]  **6. The Dust of Ages**
>The floor of this room is covered with a layer of fine gray dust and ash, three inches deep. There are two empty alcoves to the north and south. As you move into the room, your steps send motes of dust and ash swirling into the air, and these clouds form into shapes.
>First, from the ash, a dusty phantom assumes the shape of a woman. Her face is forlorn and tear-streaked. She throws up her hands in despair, rushes into one of the alcoves, and disappears.
>Immediately afterward, two more dusty phantoms emerge - mighty warriors armed with jagged-edged swords and bearing fierce countenances. They move to block the doorway where you entered.

* If the characters approach the phantom guards, they raise their swords threateningly. But they can cause no harm, for they are just images of the long-dead past.
* For as long as the characters remain in the room, other phantoms - in the shapes of priests, sages, and mourning young women - briefly form out of the dust and then dissipate. Moving through any of these phantom forms causes them to collapse.
* Maybe come up with a list/table of interesting phantoms to appear, possibly as allusions to other events in the story?

##### 5: The Court of Contemplation

 - [ ]  **The Petitioner's Chamber**
*If any bowls in previous rooms had been left empty:*
>High Priest Ixion, his voice echoing slightly in the chamber, addresses you with a stark clarity:
>"Before you, six bowls, each a testament to the paths you've walked within these walls. To proceed, fill what is empty with tokens of knowledge or personal sacrifice. The gate opens only when the past is complete."
>He pauses, allowing the weight of his words to settle, then adds simply, "Neglect leaves the way closed. Choose wisely."

*If all bowls in previous rooms were filled:*
>High Priest Ixion nods approvingly as he observes six filled bowls, and speaks with a reserved satisfaction:
>"Each vessel stands testament to your diligence and respect for the paths you've walked. The way forward lies open to you, as promised. Proceed with the reverence due to those who tread close to the veil between life and death."

* A panel of priests outside of the gypsosphinx's chamber prevent interlopers from gaining access. Six bowls in the room represent the same bowls in the previous rooms, with any that were already given offering full with that same offering. The priests require all six bowls to be full before allowing access, so players may return to the previous rooms, or place objects in the bowls here if they choose. Only when all six bowls are full will the iron gate leading deeper into the temple open. Ixion and the other priests never move beyond this room.
* The priests behind Ixion chant as long as the players are in the room. These chants could also be used in other rooms of the temple as needed.

**Chant Prayers**:
>"Hearts bound in mortal coil, release your hold, embrace the soil. Return to earth, to dark rebirth, find peace at last upon this hearth."
>"Through gates of bone and halls of dread, lead us where the living fear to tread. Guide our souls, forever roam, within your halls we find our home."
>"By the breath that withers, by the gaze that binds, unlock the secrets that the darkness finds. Let not our hearts fear the night, for in your truth we find the light."
>"Guide our steps through paths untold, guard our spirits, fierce and bold. In the night where shadows play, lead us where the spirits lay."

##### 6: Gypsosphinx's Lair

 - [ ]  **The Sphinx's Hoard**

- The gypsosphinx's "hoard" contains mostly knowledge of life and death the sphinx's priests have collected, as well as a few random treasures - mostly gems (carnelian, jade, and opal) and trinkets (symbols of death such as ankhs). This hoard is located before the sphinx's lair, as a library-like antechamber, which keeps space between the sphinx and its priests.
- If any players have died while in the temple, they can be found here, unconscious but easily shaken awake.

 - [ ]  **The Gypsosphinx's Challenge**

* In a grand court, the players finally come face to face with the gypsosphinx itself, who challenges them not just to combat but to a duel of wits and wills, debating over topics of life, death, and purpose.
* As they strike the killing blow on the gypsosphinx, it lets out an evil cackle as it falls to its death, and at the same time the players all collapse as well and fall unconscious.
* As they wake, the players find that the temple has shifted, no... actually flipped upside down!

`encounter: 1: Gypsosphinx`

>"If we fight, I will kill you and eat your heart. I have seen it."

##### 7: Conclusion

 - [ ]  **A New Path** (Temple of Mana Incarnate)

- As they make their way back toward the entrance, all of the previous rooms have been replaced with studies and other rooms containing lawful priests in misty blue-green robes (known as Incarnum Hierarchs), who refuse to speak.
	- 6: A large zen sand garden, in which priests can be seen raking the sand and carefully placing rocks. If asked, they say the sand represents purity, and the flow of mana all around us, while the rocks represent aggregations of mana such as people.
	- 5: A huge circular library, surrounded on all sides by books, in which priests read and study quietly (unwilling to speak). Books are split into three sections, with life and order on one side, chaos and death on the other, and the nature of magic (including mana flow and reincarnation) in the center.
	- 4: A beautiful forested park in which priests read quietly on benches.
	- 3: Pool of Pure Sight: A pool that now shows the players anything they ask to see. Anything. Anywhere.
	- 2: Still priests, now adorned differently, and discussing the nature and power of knowledge, secrets, and magic.
	- 1: Decorative blue-green crystal golems adorn the room.
- The previous "Ceremonial Entryway" rooms are now one large room which contains a large misty blue-green gem, which addresses the players when they enter. It tells them they are in the Temple of Mana Incarnate, and that it is an Incarnum (dedicated to law) that can answer any question they may think of.
- Goal here is to give the players any and all additional information they may need to finish the game - how to get to Argonnessen, how to defeat the dragons, what are their motivations, etc. Any important questions not asked by the players by the end could be asked by Valmoc.
- When they leave the temple, the entrance magically distorts, hiding it from those who may seek to find it.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Gypsosphinx temples are where the sphinx is served by an order of priests who understand its hunger, entertain it with discussions of philosophy, butchery, and gossip, and know when to withdraw and leave their patron to silent contemplation. Such temples are often quite rich, as the gypsosphinx at its heart demands its priests live well, the better to reflect its own importance and status.
 - [ ]  The obsidian dragon Arstyvrax once visited the temple to study the necromantic energies here, suggesting a link between his current plot and ancient death magics.
 - [ ]  This temple is said to somehow be in the same location as another hidden ancient temple, known as the Temple of Mana Incarnate. No one here knows exactly how that's the case.
 - [ ]  The ankh seen around the temple is a symbol of death, which is said to be personified as an actual creature who resides somewhere amongst the planes.
 - [ ]  Offerings are valued in the temple, symbolizing the idea that you can't take you possessions with you when you die, and what you do with them is important.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Just like Reigney's temple was based on the Greek apotropaic temple, this one is based on the Greek necromanteion temple.
* The flipped temple is based on the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon, which is a passing reference in the wiki to an old 3.5e book called Magic of Incarnum. The nature of magic in this book is almost exactly as I have described it in my own notes on [[Magic]]. But to avoid confusion with sapphire dragons (and since no one probably knows what a sapphire eidolon even is), I renamed the temple to the Temple of Mana Incarnate, with the priests being Incarnum Hierarchs (and the gem being called Incarnum).
* Ritual use of the Necromanteion involved elaborate ceremonies wherein celebrants seeking to speak to the dead would start by gathering in the ziggurat-like temple and consuming a meal of broad beans, pork, barley bread, oysters, and a narcotic compound. Following a cleansing ceremony and the sacrifice of sheep, the faithful would descend through a chthonic series of meandering corridors leaving offerings as they passed through a number of iron gates. The nekromanteia would pose a series of questions and chant prayers and the celebrants would then witness the priest arise from the floor and begin to fly through the temple.
* Accompanied by flocks of vultures and often served by packs of gnolls, ogres, and hyenas, gypsosphinxes living in deserts, plains, hills, and even mountainous terrain often acquire a large number of followers and would-be helpers. This eventually leads a gypsosphinx to anger, as it requires some solitude and peace, and (depending on her mood) it will either abandon her entourage by casting *greater invisibility* and flying off, or it will turn them into a hearty meal by casting *cloudkill*. In either case, the survivors sometimes tell the tale of the creature’s wrath, discouraging others from following a gypsosphinx in search of wisdom.
