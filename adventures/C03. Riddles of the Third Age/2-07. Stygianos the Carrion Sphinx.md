### Background and Hook(s)

* The lair of a fallen sphinx, a Gypsosphinx (or creature of death and carrion) is hidden in the Endworld Mountains.
* Reigney directs the players toward this general area on a mission to conquer this sphinx (his sibling).
* The players may decide to start with any of the three nearby town scenes below, who will give them some information about the Gypsosphinx.

### Characters and Locations

* **Stygianos** (NE male gypsosphinx).

* **[[Karrlakton]]**
* **[[Loom Keep]]**
* **[[Gatherhold]]**
* **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]**
* **Endwall Mountains**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1. Finding the Sphinx

 - [ ]  **[[Karrlakton]] or [[Loom Keep]]** (Karrnath)

* Escher in Loom Keep has been entreating the creature to reveal the time and place of his death, hoping to ensure his immortality. He has been bringing payment in the form of human corpses. But the sphinx has yet to reveal its exact location, and he's been leaving the corpse scraps at the foot of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Gatherhold]]** (Talenta Plains)

* The halflings of Gatherhold have seen the sphinx flying overhead at night. They have also found dead dinosaurs across the desert during their hunts. The trail appears to head toward the south end of the Endwall Mountains.

 - [ ]  **[[Wyrmwatch, Hope]]** (Q'barra)

* The people of Wyrmwatch, Hope have benefitted from the nearby sphinx lair, as time doesn't pass normally there. The same people have been running the community for over fifty years, but don't seem to be aware of it because they never leave. They believe the sphinx to be a celestial servant or reflection of the Silver Flame, and they worship it when it flies overhead.
* Most residents know that the sphinx's lair is on the east side of the Endwall Mountains, somewhere north of Wyrmwatch.

##### 1: The Sphinx's Welcome

 - [ ]  **Navigating the Endwall Mountains**

* It takes three DC 15 Survival checks in order to find the sphinx's lair, with any failures leading to a random encounter. But for each piece of information obtained from one of the above locations, one necessary Survival check is eliminated, so it's possible to get there without any checks.

 - [ ]  **The Entrance Riddle**

* Upon entering the temple, the players are greeted by a large statue of the gypsosphinx, which poses a riddle that hints at themes of death, transformation, and the cycle of life. The correct answer grants access into the temple.
* If the players attempt to leave or answer incorrectly, the statue animates and attempts to trap them within the temple's entrance chamber, believing them unworthy. Overcoming this challenge requires clever thinking, possibly convincing the sphinx of their worth through debate or outsmarting it with a trick.

##### 2: The Hall of Whispers

 - [ ]  **Philosophical Puzzles**

* The players navigate a hall filled with whispering sands that recount tales and philosophies of death and the desert. Interacting correctly with these tales reveals hidden paths or secret chambers filled with treasure or knowledge.

 - [ ]  **Priestly Parley**

* They encounter priests of the gypsosphinx, engaged in a ritualistic debate. Joining or influencing this debate with insights gained from the Hall of Whispers can earn the priests' respect, who might then offer aid or reveal shortcuts through the temple.

##### 3: The Oasis of Decay

 - [ ]  **Deceptive Oasis**

* A seemingly lush oasis in the heart of the temple is revealed to be an illusion covering a pit of quicksand, home to a Sandwyrm. The players must navigate this perilous area, with the lantern possibly revealing the presence of the Sandwyrm.

 - [ ]  **The Undead Mirage**

* The oasis also hides entrances to underground chambers where Accursed Defilers and Anubians dwell. Discovering these chambers can lead to combat or bargaining with the undead, potentially uncovering secrets of the gypsosphinx or treasures it has hoarded.

##### 4: The Court of Contemplation

 - [ ]  **The Petitioner's Chamber**

* A panel of priests outside of the gypsosphinx's chamber prevent interlopers from gaining access. Players will need to plead their case in order to gain access.

 - [ ]  **The Gypsosphinx's Challenge**

* In a grand court, the players finally come face to face with the gypsosphinx itself, who challenges them not just to combat but to a duel of wits and wills, debating over topics of life, death, and purpose.
* Depending on the players' approach, this could lead to a direct confrontation with the sphinx, supported by its Cactid guardians, or a more nuanced resolution where they satisfy the sphinx's hunger for entertainment and reflection, possibly turning it into an ally or gaining its grudging respect.

##### 5: The Treasure of Knowledge

 - [ ]  **The Sphinx's Hoard**

Beyond the court lies the treasure vault, filled not just with material wealth but ancient knowledge collected by the gypsosphinx. Among these treasures is an item or tome that is key to the players' quest or reveals a new threat looming on the horizon.

 - [ ]  **A New Path**

As they leave, the players find that the temple has shifted, revealing a previously hidden path that leads directly into the heart of the Endwall Mountains. This path could lead to the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon?

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Monsters: Sandwyrm (ToB1, CR 6), Sand Silhouette (ToB1, CR 6), Accursed Defiler (ToB1, CR 4), Anubian (ToB1, CR 2), Cactid (ToB1, CR 3), Death Vulture (ToB2, CR 4) Gypsosphinx (ToB, CR 14)
* Possibly incorporate the Temple of the Sapphire Eidolon as a powerful artifact opportunity.
* Gypsosphinx temples are where the sphinx is served by an order of priests who understand its hunger, entertain it with discussions of philosophy, butchery, and gossip, and know when to withdraw and leave their patron to silent contemplation. Such temples are often quite rich, as the gypsosphinx at its heart demands its priests live well, the better to reflect its own importance and status.
* Open with a statue of a Gypsosphinx that presents them a riddle, then comes to life and traps the players when they try to leave (see White Plume Mountain, room 2 and "Escaping the Dungeon").
* Accompanied by flocks of vultures and often served by packs of gnolls, ogres, and hyenas, gypsosphinxes living in deserts, plains, hills, and even mountainous terrain often acquire a large number of followers and would-be helpers. This eventually leads a gypsosphinx to anger, as it requires some solitude and peace, and (depending on her mood) it will either abandon her entourage by casting greater invisibility and flying off, or it will turn them into a hearty meal by casting cloudkill. In either case, the survivors sometimes tell the tale of the creatureâ€™s wrath, discouraging others from following a gypsosphinx in search of wisdom.
