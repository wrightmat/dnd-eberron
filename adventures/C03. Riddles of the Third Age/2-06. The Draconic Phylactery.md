* **[[Mournland (Cyre)]]**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Veil of Mourning

 - [ ]  **The Dead Grey Mists**

>As you step into the thick, enveloping mist of the Mournland, the air grows cold and heavy, dampening the sounds of your footsteps and cloaking the landscape in a ghostly silence. Suddenly, a shape begins to form within the swirling fog—a great cat, its sleek gray coat barely visible as tendrils of smoke drift off its body, leaving misty whorls in its wake. Its eyes, shifting from dull, pallid orbs to pitch black slits, fixate on you as it pads noiselessly closer. As its body fades in and out of the fog, it curls its lips into a fang-revealing smile and utters in a voice as sinuous as the mist, "Whooo... are... you?"

Entering The Mournland, the party encounters a mysterious Vapor Lynx who patrols the fogs. Its personality is inspired by the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, and should present cryptic statements to the players (using any of the example lines below), attacking at the first opportunity to catch them unawares.

>"Curiouser and curiouser, why do the bold wander where the land itself has lost its way? Beware, for not all who wander are lost—some are just buried beneath their fears."

>"Do circles have ends? If you walk long enough here, you might find where the circle begins, or perhaps, where it breaks."

>"In the Mournland, truths are draped in riddles, and riddles are wrapped in the mist. Can you unravel a truth if you cannot trust your own eyes?"

`encounter: 1: Vapor Lynx`

 - [ ]  **Ghostly Village**

Navigating through a ghostly village, the party encounters spirits unable to pass on, trapped in the moment of the cataclysm. These spirits provide cryptic warnings about Haze-of-Death and the unnatural forces at play in The Mournland.

This abandoned and ruined city, has buildings with windows that reflect the vibrant city it used to be - containing happy families going about their everday activities.

##### 2: Abandoned Laboratory

 - [ ]  **Entering the Laboratory**

The party discovers an abandoned laboratory, its experiments frozen in time. Here, they must solve puzzles related to the magical research that was being conducted, possibly involving the manipulation of living spells or the containment of unnatural phenomena.

 - [ ]  **Sentient Living Spells**

In the laboratory, the party encounters a sentient Living Spell, a remnant of a magical experiment that has gained consciousness. Communicating with or battling this entity reveals clues to Haze-of-Death's location and condition.

##### 3: Remnants of Battles

 - [ ]  **Field of the Corpse Mound**

Crossing what appears to be a battlefield, the party is ambushed by a Corpse Mound, a grotesque amalgamation of fallen soldiers, animated by the land's lingering magic. This encounter emphasizes the horrors of the Day of Mourning and the twisted life it has birthed.

 - [ ]  **Garden of Twisted Metal**

A once-magnificent garden, now a field of petrified and twisted metal trees, symbolizes the war's devastation. Death Butterfly Swarms are all that inhabit the area.
##### 4: Confrontation with Haze-of-Death

 - [ ]  **Battle with Haze-of-Death**

Approaching Haze-of-Death's lair, the party must traverse a landscape scarred by necromantic energy. Haze-of-Death, a once-noble being now twisted by the Mournland, emerges as the final guardian. The battle is challenging, not just physically but emotionally, as Haze-of-Death is both a victim and a monster.

 - [ ]  **Mid-Battle Break**

Mid-battle, the party has the opportunity to reach the remnants of Kazdurakashtan's mind, through a burst of magical energy that emerges from the next room (the phylactery). This offers a chance for the party to save him or at least grant him peace.

##### 5: Revelation of the Phylactery

 - [ ]  **Phylactery Chamber**

Upon defeating or bypassing Haze-of-Death, the party finds the Draconic Phylactery in a chamber that is a nexus of necromantic energy. Interacting with the phylactery grants visions of Arstyvrax's plans, revealing new targets, allies, and the extent of the necromantic dragon's ambition.

 - [ ]  **Visions of Danger**

The resolution involves securing the phylactery. The party must decide how to use its power responsibly, aware of the dangers it poses. They may also discover a method to communicate or negotiate with Arstyvrax, setting the stage for a confrontation or a strategic alliance against a greater threat implied by the phylactery's visions.

* Monsters: Vapor Lynx (ToB1), Corpse Mound (ToB1), Death Butterfly Swarm (ToB1), Living Spells
* Incorporate some localized time travel shenanigans, so the players can maybe see some of the history of Haze-of-Death and/or Arstyvrax? And use this to tie the area to Staff in a fun way?
