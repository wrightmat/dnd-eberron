 - [ ]  **Garden of Twisted Metal**

A once-magnificent garden, now a field of petrified and twisted metal trees, symbolizes the war's devastation. Death Butterfly Swarms are all that inhabit the area.
##### 4: Confrontation with Haze-of-Death

 - [ ]  **Battle with Haze-of-Death**

Approaching Haze-of-Death's lair, the party must traverse a landscape scarred by necromantic energy. Haze-of-Death, a once-noble being now twisted by the Mournland, emerges as the final guardian. The battle is challenging, not just physically but emotionally, as Haze-of-Death is both a victim and a monster.

 - [ ]  **Mid-Battle Break**

Mid-battle, the party has the opportunity to reach the remnants of Kazdurakashtan's mind, through a burst of magical energy that emerges from the next room (the phylactery). This offers a chance for the party to save him or at least grant him peace.

##### 5: Revelation of the Phylactery

The resolution involves securing the phylactery. The party must decide how to use its power responsibly, aware of the dangers it poses.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* [[Kazdurakashtan (Haze-of-Death)]], who was in Cyre on the Day of Mourning and was morphed into a monstrous version of himself.
* Monsters: Vapor Lynx (ToB1), Corpse Mound (ToB1), Death Butterfly Swarm (ToB1), Living Spells
* Incorporate some localized time travel shenanigans, so the players can maybe see some of the history of Haze-of-Death and/or Arstyvrax? And use this to tie the area to Staff in a fun way?
