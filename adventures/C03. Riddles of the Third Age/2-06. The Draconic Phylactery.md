* **[[Mournland (Cyre)]]**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: The Veil of Mourning

 - [ ]  **The Dead Grey Mists**

>As you step into the thick, enveloping mist of the Mournland, the air grows cold and heavy, dampening the sounds of your footsteps and cloaking the landscape in a ghostly silence. Suddenly, a shape begins to form within the swirling fog — a great cat, its sleek gray coat barely visible as tendrils of smoke drift off its body, leaving misty whorls in its wake. Its eyes, shifting from dull, pallid orbs to pitch black slits, fixate on you as it pads noiselessly closer. As its body fades in and out of the fog, it curls its lips into a fang-revealing smile and utters in a voice as sinuous as the mist, "Whooo... are... you?"

Entering The Mournland, the party encounters a mysterious Vapor Lynx who patrols the fogs. Its personality is inspired by the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, and should present cryptic statements to the players (using any of the example lines below), attacking at the first opportunity to catch them unawares.

>"Curiouser and curiouser, why do the bold wander where the land itself has lost its way? Beware, for not all who wander are lost — some are just buried beneath their fears."

>"Do circles have ends? If you walk long enough here, you might find where the circle begins, or perhaps, where it breaks."

>"In the Mournland, truths are draped in riddles, and riddles are wrapped in the mist. Can you unravel a truth if you cannot trust your own eyes?"

`encounter: 1: Vapor Lynx`

##### 2: The Pointcrawl

All scene locations below are keyed to the [[Mournland (Cyre)]] map. 

 - [ ]  **1. Dollen on the River**

A town once stood here, but burned down years ago by an invading army during the Last War. Every building is nothing but a foundation, bricks lay blackened and scattered, and all the fields are torched. That is, except for one cottage near the edge of town, which appears cozy and inviting. A fire is lit in the hearth and smoke is coming out of the chimney. Sounds of music and laughter can be heard and shapes of people dancing can be seen through the curtains.

Inside, the cottage is empty of people, but there is food on the hearth and no matter what the temperature is outside, it is warm and comfortable inside. Regardless of how many characters are present, there are enough spacious rooms and feather beds for everyone to have their own. Unseen Servants provide everything from cooking to turndown service. A DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check suggests a modified Mirage Arcana or Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion is responsible for the cottage. But it takes a DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check to correctly identify that the cottage is itself a ghost. The cottage is extremely shy and doesn’t manifest an avatar, which will communicate directly with the characters, unless they spend at least 3 full days here.

 - [ ]  **2. Swoz**

A camp of a half dozen tents occupied by warforged who are allied with the Lord of Blades. At the center of the camp is a large tent for the enclave’s commander (see below) and a forge which doubles as a center of religious rites related to the Lord of Blades. The camp perimeter is always guarded by four warforged scouts who either ambush the characters, or alert the camp, depending on how strong the adventurers seem. The entire camp is hostile to any non-warforged and will attack in force. Approximately a dozen other warforged live here, a combination of commoners and thugs.

There is also a commander who knows information about strikes happening against humanoids outside the Mournland and the location of one other enclave. As the commander is absolutely loyal to the Lord of Blades getting this information will require magical coercion.

Roll a d4 to determine the enclave's commander and the magic item that they possess:
1. Echo, priest, carrying a Pearl of Power.
2. Jury, veteran, with a Sentinel Shield (19 AC).
3. Safeguard, martial arts adept, with Stone of Good Luck.
4. Ember, mage, with Headband of Intellect (spell DC 15).

 - [ ]  **3. Fort Bright**

In the distance there is a large encampment of twenty tents including a large tent for a commander. Within the camp are four burning cooking fires. Silhouettes of four humanoid figures appear to be standing and sitting around one of the cooking fires watching the roasts. No matter how long the camp is observed, no figures can be seen moving around.

Inside the camp, empty sets of clothes and armor are strewn everywhere as if suddenly abandoned. Inside the tents are weapons and provisions similarly discarded. The four humanoid figures by the fire are empty suits of plate mail which haven't yet toppled over. Upon being touched, the suits crumble to dust.

The commander’s tent contains comfortable cushions and chairs and a table covered with battle maps and miniatures of the surrounding terrain. A cursory inspection of the maps shows that the nearby landscape has been radically altered; hills, trees, and rivers are no longer where they once were. A locked chest contains orders from Metrol, two [[potion of healing]], and a spell scroll of *[[revivify]]* which could not save the inhabitants of the camp.

At night the camp is haunted by 4 specters which don’t communicate and fight until destroyed. The specters won't leave the camp, and even if destroyed, will return each night.

 - [ ]  **4. Eston**

The area within two miles of this site is littered with pieces of clockwork and severed metal-wood limbs characteristic of warforged composite plating. As the characters move toward the enclave they can hear rustling in the woods and the occasional metal-wood animal can be seen in the brush.

Before reaching the enclave, anyone passing through is ambushed by a group of animal-like warforged. Roll on the encounter table. Use the normal statistics for such creatures, except change their type to construct, and they are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage as well as the poisoned condition.

| dice: 1d6 | Encounter                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |

| 5         | `encounter: 2d4: Boar` (warforged)          |
| 6         | `encounter: 15: Lizard` (warforged, swarm)  |
^mournland-eston-encounter

The enclave was once a small research laboratory for House Cannith until it was torched during the Last War. All that remains are the foundations of the building and an irreparably damaged creation forge which lies beneath the rubble. Once per day at noon it sends out glowing mists and produces a highly aggressive animal-like warforged.

Even though it is broken, knowledge of this creation forge’s location would be of great interest to Cannith South. However, the Treaty of Thronehold forbids the creation of new warforged. Instead, the characters might destroy it and claim a bounty of up to 1,000 gp from a fund set up during the Treaty of Thronehold.

 - [ ]  **5. Kalazart**

This small town has been almost entirely converted into a massive hive and its streets are filled with honeycomb. Hundreds of giant worker bees (use the statistics for a giant fly) swarm the hive, while others arrive and leave in small groups, searching for prey. Dozens of giant soldier bees (giant wasps) patrol the hive in groups of 4, and either attack, or seek reinforcements after sizing up intruders. The leader of the hive is a giant queen bee (giant scorpion with 16 Intelligence), who can communicate telepathically in a 500 foot radius.

If the characters fight or sneak through a wave of soldiers, the defenders suddenly depart. After a few moments, the queen bee introduces herself to them telepathically and invites them to dine with her. If they accept, a group of giant courtier bees wearing humanoid suits escorts them to the queen’s chambers. The queen’s intentions are left to the DM.

Opening up a honeycomb requires the use of an action. Roll on the following table to determine its contents. Each magic item can only be encountered once.

| dice: 1d10 | Honeycomb Contents                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-4        | The corpse of an animal, encased in honey.           |
| 5          | The corpse of a humanoid, encased in honey.          |
| 6          | The corpse of a humanoid, wearing Helm of Telepathy. |
| 7          | A Decanter of Endless Water producing water.         |
| 8-9        | A giant bee larva.                                   |
| 10         | Royal jelly (treat as Keoghtom’s Ointment).          |

 - [ ]  **6. Metrol**

The remains of what was once the tracks for a lightning rail. The characters find a line of now inert pyramidal structures leading to an abandoned Lightning Rail Station and continuing off into the distance to both the east and west.

One or more of the stones has been damaged and a lightning quasi-elemental (air elemental whose attacks deal lightning damage) has been released. Despite being set free of its casing, it is still bound to stay within 100 feet of the conductor stones themselves. The elemental has been driven mad by its imprisonment within the stone and the Mournland and attacks anyone that approaches. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check indicates that a Dispel Magic cast on the elemental, or the stone, will disperse it. Also, if the elemental fails a save against a Calm Emotions, or similar spell, it can be reasoned with.

House Orien is willing to pay generously for concrete information on the whereabouts of conductor stones in the Mournland, up to 500 gp per mile of stones.

 - [ ]  **7. Tronish**

Two huge creatures are battling over this region to be their hunting area. One looks humanoid, but has hands where its eyes belong. Its skin is covered in patches of scales, fur, and rock. The other is a quadruped whose skin is covered in scar tissue and knots. It has far too many eyes in too many places.

Left alone, one of the creatures will win in 3 rounds and then immediately turn its assault on the characters. At this point, the creature is injured, but its wounds rapidly begin closing and healing themselves. Treat it as a mammoth with regeneration 5, starting at half health (63 hit points).

 - [ ]  **8. Making**

???

 - [ ]  **9. Broken Tower**

A daelkyr (use the statistics of an ultroloth with at-will confusion if it engages in combat) has broken free of its prison in Khyber. It is turning the area in a few mile radius into its own personal canvas; creating masterpieces of reshaped flesh. Plants, animals, and the ground itself, have all been stretched into grotesque shapes and changed into striking arrays of colors. Pairs of dolgrims patrol the area, but generally avoid conflict and instead lead anyone they encounter back to their master’s base of operations. At the center of the region is a small fort. The daelkyr lives here along with a dozen dolgrim servants and a pair of dolgaunts.

The daelkyr is curious and interested in finding new subjects for its artwork more than anything. They are welcoming and communicate telepathically with the characters offering to transform them into beautiful new forms. They don’t take no for an answer. Anyone who accepts is given a random Boon and gains a minor physical alteration (such as a height, skin, eye, or hair color change). If the daelkyr is threatened, or the characters refuse the invitation, they order the dolgaunts, or a group of four dolgrim, to fight the characters to the death. Afterwards, they continue parleying, unfazed. The daelkyr will fight only to defend themselves and only when all of their minions are dead.

 - [ ]  **10. Greenland**

In a small abandoned town of ten houses lives a close-knit community of two dozen warforged commoners. Not needing food or water, the group lives here in relative safety, self sufficient and separate from the nations of Khorvaire. The community is organized around a forge used for repairing community members. The forge is run by twin warforged gladiators named Hammer and Anvil. They are also the leaders of the enclave. Additionally, a warforged priest of the Becoming God, named the Architect, runs a small shrine and serves as a spiritual leader.

Non-warforged characters are viewed with suspicion. The enclave doesn’t want the outside world to find them. However, they will allow outsiders to stay the night and rest. They are also willing to sell or barter for wooden, leather, and metallic items found in the Player’s Handbook. If the PCs manage to befriend the warforged, they will find them to be quite knowledgeable and talkative about the surrounding terrain including knowledge of a similar warforged enclave within a few dozen miles.

If the characters spend at least a day visiting the enclave, one of the following events occurs. Roll a d6:
1. A warforged named Mason is murdered. Everyone suspects the PCs.
2. Chip, an apprentice wizard, asks to join the PCs to learn more about the world.
3. A holy day is celebrated with lots of incense burned and partying in the streets.
4. Several scavengers return with scrap, with a pack of `encounter: 2d4: Rust Monster` chasing them.
5. A trader from the Lord of Blades Enclave arrives.
6. A rust storm blows through town. Any non-warforged characters, who are immune to the worst effects of the storm, are enlisted to board up the houses.

 - [ ]  **11. Whitehearth**

Four black metal posts, each 50 feet tall, are all that remain of a House Cannith research site. The posts radiate an aura of divination magic. Anyone passing within half a mile of this site cannot properly orient themselves via any means, including using rivers, roads, or other landmarks. A compass or a character with the keen mind feat will get random results each time they are consulted.

Roll a d6 to see who or what is encountered here. They are generally lost and irritable and may attack. After leaving the site, determine randomly which direction the characters travel.
1. No one is currently lost here. Well, except you.
2. Six skeletons from a necromancy unit from Karrnath, which have been trying to return to their encampment for five years, but are too unintelligent to realize they are lost.
3. Lost adventuring party of a spy (Janelle), scout (Markoh), and veteran (Andreas).
4. An oaken bolter which survived the disaster that destroyed the research site.
5. Six reef sharks which are living on land somehow.
6. A near-starving brown bear.

 - [ ]  **12. Barren Keep**

This tower once served as an advance guard tower against invasions of Cyre. It stands in partial disrepair and is covered in a thick layer of ivy. If the ivy is hacked away, vine blights emerge and attack.

`encounter: 1d6: Vine Blight`

The interior of the tower has a few bodies of humans in scale armor wearing the livery of Cyre. They have no discernable wounds. The second floor of the tower contains a pair of dead gnomes and a House Sivis Sending Stone which was used during the war to send warning messages. House Sivis would be willing to pay 1000 gp for the recovery of one of these stones.

 - [ ]  **13. Seaside**

The town of Seaside contains a dozen or so buildings, including a shrine dedicated to the Sovereign Host, a general store, and an inn. The buildings are intact and well-maintained, but the occupants of the town are all undead and are mostly skeletons and zombies. The townsfolk continue to go about their daily business, running the stores, tending their fields, and worshipping at the shrines. The people in the town are extremely friendly and willing to go out of their way to help in any way they can. It’s been months since any traders came through, and they’re excited for news from the outside world.

The townsfolk are completely unaware that they are no longer alive and don’t realize that Cyre is dead. If somehow forced to acknowledge these facts, or to reflect on their memories of the Day of Mourning, they lose their sanity and lash out against anyone alive. If left alone, the town is a perfectly safe place to trade for equipment and provisions and rest up. The Mournland’s effects on rests do not affect Seaside.

Notable NPCs include Jerediah Semet (LN male skeleton), the town’s mayor, an alchemist named Annallisse (N female apprentice mage with the undead type), and Sovereign Anaxander (NG female ghoul), the town’s priest.

 - [ ]  **14. Shaelas Tiraleth**

The characters encounter the remnants of a party of elves from Valenar, who sought to glorify their ancestors by battling the horrors of the Mournland. Their leader is Masheeni (LG female valenar elf gladiator), and she is leading four remaining warriors (N male and female valenar elf tribal warriors) back toward Valenar. All are suffering from two levels of exhaustion. They’ve lost about half of their members, including their priest (whose body they are carrying), but all believe the trip to have been a rousing success. They are willing to trade for any aid they can get:
- They’re willing to purchase services or provisions with the 500 gp they carry.
- They have 3 spell scrolls of *[[greater restoration]]* and a scroll of *[[raise dead]]*, which they would like to use to raise their priest, but none in the group can cast from it.
- They know the location of several interesting ruins in the Mournland, including some “safe” nearby locations where they've killed or driven away all of the nearby monsters.
- Masheeni carries a [[Medallion of Thoughts]] which she would gladly trade for a magical blade.

 - [ ]  **16. Crimson Water**



 - [ ]  **17. Jarp**



 - [ ]  **18. Glass Plateau**



##### 3: The Cavern of Flesh

 - [ ]  **Entering the Laboratory**

The party discovers an abandoned laboratory, its experiments frozen in time. Here, they must solve puzzles related to the magical research that was being conducted, possibly involving the manipulation of living spells or the containment of unnatural phenomena.

 - [ ]  **Sentient Living Spells**

In the laboratory, the party encounters a sentient Living Spell, a remnant of a magical experiment that has gained consciousness. Communicating with or battling this entity reveals clues to Haze-of-Death's location and condition.

##### 4: Confrontation with Haze-of-Death

 - [ ]  **Battle with Haze-of-Death**

Approaching Haze-of-Death's lair, the party must traverse a landscape scarred by necromantic energy. Haze-of-Death, a once-noble being now twisted by the Mournland, emerges as the final guardian. The battle is challenging, not just physically but emotionally, as Haze-of-Death is both a victim and a monster.

 - [ ]  **Mid-Battle Break**

Mid-battle, the party has the opportunity to reach the remnants of Kazdurakashtan's mind, through a burst of magical energy that emerges from the next room (the phylactery). This offers a chance for the party to save him or at least grant him peace.

##### 5: Revelation and Return

 - [ ]  **Phylactery Chamber**

Upon defeating or bypassing Haze-of-Death, the party finds the Draconic Phylactery in a chamber that is a nexus of necromantic energy. Interacting with the phylactery grants visions of Arstyvrax's plans, revealing new targets, allies, and the extent of the necromantic dragon's ambition.

 - [ ]  **Visions of Danger**

The resolution involves securing the phylactery. The party must decide how to use its power responsibly, aware of the dangers it poses. They may also discover a method to communicate or negotiate with Arstyvrax, setting the stage for a confrontation or a strategic alliance against a greater threat implied by the phylactery's visions.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* [[Kazdurakashtan (Haze-of-Death)]], who was in Cyre on the Day of Mourning and was morphed into a monstrous version of himself.
* Monsters: Vapor Lynx (ToB1), Corpse Mound (ToB1), Death Butterfly Swarm (ToB1), Living Spells
* Incorporate some localized time travel shenanigans, so the players can maybe see some of the history of Haze-of-Death and/or Arstyvrax? And use this to tie the area to Staff in a fun way?
