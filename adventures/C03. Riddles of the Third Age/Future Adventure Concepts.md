The idea is to have a second set of adventures after the first prepared Sphinx adventures which are more specifically tailored toward the PCs and their needs and desires, as they prepare to take on the dragons. There should be some turning point before the second chapter - probably the attack on Sharn by the white dragons (where Valmoc should be wounded or even killed). By the end of chapter one, the PCs should have full knowledge of the dragon tribes, the attack on Shae Mordai by the obsidian dragons, and their leader's desire to revive the Overlord Tiamat. With the full breadth of their challenge revealed, they should be encouraged to seek out additonal powerful weapons that will be needed to face the obsidian dragons.

* A temple in the depths of the Moonsword Jungle of Aerenal is rumored to house a lost [[Moonblade]] from one of the ancient elven houses. But this powerful weapon is protected by incredibly strong monsters.
	* Probably need to have the party at at least level 10 before going here, so do primarily CR 8 to 13 monsters.

* Speartip Island?

* The Mystic Glade (see Dragons of Eberron, pg. 90-91)?
