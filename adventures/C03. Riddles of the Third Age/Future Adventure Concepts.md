The idea is to have a second set of adventures after the first prepared Sphinx adventures which are more specifically tailored toward the PCs and their needs and desires, as they prepare to take on the dragons. There should be some turning point before the second chapter - probably the attack on Sharn by the white dragons (where Flamewind is killed). By the end of chapter one, the PCs should have full knowledge of the dragon tribes, the attack on Shae Mordai by the topaz dragons, and their obsidian dragon leader's desire to revive the Overlord Tiamat. With the full breadth of their challenge revealed, they should be encouraged to seek out additional powerful weapons that will be needed to face the dragons.

The second chapter adventures are designed to be longer, and fully follow the Five Room Dungeon format. Each should take two to three sessions, depending on how much the players explore the area surrounding and engage with NPCs. At the end of each adventure, the players will gain a level (starting at level 6 after the Sarlona and Final Lair adventure with the king), resulting in about level 15 at the end. The Ancient Topaz Dragon is CR 20, so should be a great challenge level given all of the magic items and draconic form they have access to.

### Story Beats
Below are some story beats that can still be weaved into the campaign - just need to find good places to do so.

- **Dragon Attack**. At least one more needs to happen to their ship on the way to Adar, probably by the brass dragons. If more story advancement is needed, a second earlier attack could be done, just need to decide by which faction and where.

- **Thronehold Council**. A council held on the subject of the dragons may make sense, but not sure who would organize it. Possibly the gold dragons at Thronehold, but then it would have to be a front (and they would need a motivation to do so) since they're in on it. Inspiration from the Councils of Waterdeep in Tyranny of Dragons (Rise of Tiamat).

- **Return of Prince Lorrister**. Could be interesting to give the players a ride on the Heavenly Fleet's flagship, as a way to see all of Khorvaire and the impact the dragons are having. This could work as a way to get them to Adar if we want to do the Dragon Attack earlier to ramp up the drama.

- Travel to Irian. Should definitely incorporate Irian in a pretty major way, as it connects to all of the characters in some way (Undying for Thana, "the light" for Aither, and a possible new home and/or source of radiance for Verity as an Irian aasimar instead of Syranian). They are also already tied to Lorrister, who is an Irian aasimar.
	- Should tie in Hope and Joy somehow, probably as the primary hook. As Verity would like to help their siblings (get away from their father at least) if possible.
	- Maybe they've been exiled from Syrania as Radiant Idols, and sent to Sharn. Then they left and happened upon Shining Valley in Breland. There they allied with The Haunting Song, who they identified with because they were also considered monsters and didn't believe themselves to be so.
	- Some adventure to find the Irian manifest zone in Shining Valley, navigate/explore Irian, and possibly somehow find Shae Mordai's planar seed and re-connect it to the Material Plane.
	- Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they’re small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they’re to become.  Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.

### Adventure Concepts
Obviously any of these could be done in any order, but they're presented here in rough order of difficulty (with adventures of the same color being roughly the same difficulty).

##### [[2-01. The Storm of Speartip]]
Goal is to elucidate the blue dragons, Order of the Sapphire Scale, and give the party the opportunity to gain an ally. Also where the Dragon Claws are received. Purple difficulty (average CR 5, max CR 8).

##### [[2-02. The Moon Temple]]
Tailored to Thana, where the Moonblade is received. Purple difficulty (average CR 5, max CR 8). The Lantern of Seeking command word for Fey or Plants is found here.

##### [[2-03. Mystic Glade and Vvaraak's Cave]]
Goal is to elucidate the black dragons (and the Order of the Onyx Scale), the dragon plot generally, and possibly give the party an opportunity to gain allies. Blue difficulty (average CR 6, max CR 10). The Lantern of Seeking command word for Aberrations is found here.

##### [[2-04. Echoes of the Celestial Realm]]
Tailored to Verity, where the Platinum Scarf is received. Blue difficulty (average CR 6, max CR 10). The Lantern of Seeking command word for Celestials is found here.

##### [[2-05. Labyrinth of the Lantern's Light]]
This is a way to fully empower the Lantern of Seeking. Possibly also reveal some additional information about the world, and/or give the party the opportunity to gain an ally (the Steel Dragon NPC might be good here). Green difficulty (average CR 7, max CR 12). The Lantern of Seeking command words for Fiends, Elementals or Oozes, and Constructs are all found here.

##### [[2-06. The Draconic Phylactery]]
Probably tailored to Staff. An opportunity to give more information about Arstyvrax and his undead nature, as well as to give them control over his phylactery. Potential to ally with Haze-of-Death as well. Green difficulty (average CR 7, max CR 12).

##### [[2-07. Stygianos the Carrion Sphinx]]
Final challenge in Khorvaire, and fulfillment of the party's promise to Reigney. Could be the location of the Draakhorn? Yellow difficulty (average CR 9, max CR 15).

##### [[2-08. Through the Crystal Library]]
Most tied to Aither's backstory, but mostly a way to get to Argonnessen without being detected. Should also be a fun final challenge for all of the players, and a way to teach a lesson. Red difficulty (average CR 10, max CR 17). The Lantern of Seeking command word for Dragons is found here.

##### [[2-09 Traversing Argonnessen]]
The players emerge from the Crystal Library of Azalakardon in Argonnessen, and must traverse the center of the continent in order to get to Arstyvrax and his topaz dragons. This is run as a point crawl, with five major points (scenes below) and several minor connections that mostly lead to random encounters. Maybe of these involve dragons finding out the players, who should be traipsing across the continent unaccompanied.

##### [[2-10 The Final Battle]]
The final battle will be a multi-phase combat and roleplay encounter of some sort (scenes below), taking place near the Pit of Five Sorrows in Argonnessen.

### Magic Items

##### [[Moonblade (Vestige)]]

Designed for Thana, with a tie in to her family. Most likely, this exact sword belonged to one of her parents and is her right to wield.

##### [[Dragon Claws (Vestige)]]

Designed for Aither. When/if they get the Draakhorn and take on Megazord form, Aither is one of the hands.

##### [[Platinum Scarf (Vestige)]]

Designed for Verity. The radiant damage is a fun play with her fallen status, and the various abilities give her utility.

##### Something for Staff?

??? Need to ask Jolene what her goals are for the character, and how she wants her to grow.

##### [[Draakhorn]]

Final item that allows all of the PCs to use their Dragon Masks to create a larger form to take on the topaz dragons. Need to design mechanics.

##### Topaz Annihilator

This item from Fizban's should be the ultimate weapon that they get from defeating the topaz dragons. Or could give it earlier so they can use it on the final battle if it wouldn't entirely break the battle. Possibly it can't pierce topaz/obsidian dragon scales, since that's what powers it? But could be used against the Aspect of Tiamat?

### DM Notes

* If the players return to Shae Mordai, use the Haugbui (ToB1) as a boss monster.
* Slow Storm (ToB1) is a fun chaos-themed monster that should be used somewhere.
* Void Knight (ToB3) appears at some point as a herald of Mother Night? She sees that the players are amassing power, and taking on the dragons, and isn't happy about it.
