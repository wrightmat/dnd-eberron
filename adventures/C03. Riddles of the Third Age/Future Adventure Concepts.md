The idea is to have a second set of adventures after the first prepared Sphinx adventures which are more specifically tailored toward the PCs and their needs and desires, as they prepare to take on the dragons. There should be some turning point before the second chapter - probably the attack on Sharn by the white dragons (where Flamewind is killed). By the end of chapter one, the PCs should have full knowledge of the dragon tribes, the attack on Shae Mordai by the obsidian dragons, and their leader's desire to revive the Overlord Tiamat. With the full breadth of their challenge revealed, they should be encouraged to seek out additional powerful weapons that will be needed to face the obsidian dragons.

The second chapter adventures are designed to be longer, and fully follow the Five Room Dungeon format. Each should take two to three sessions, depending on how much the players explore the area surrounding and engage with NPCs. At the end of each adventure, the players will gain a level (starting at level 6 after the Sarlona and Final Lair adventure with the king), resulting in about level 15 at the end. The Ancient Topaz Dragon is CR 20, so should be a great challenge level given all of the magic items and draconic form they have access to.

### Adventure Concepts

##### [[2-02. Mystic Glade and Vvaraak's Cave]]

Goal is to elucidate the black dragons, Order of the Onyx Scale, and give the party the opportunity to gain an ally.

##### [[2-03. The Storm of Speartip]]

Goal is to elucidate the blue dragons, Order of the Sapphire Scale, and give the party the opportunity to gain an ally.

##### [[2-04. The Legacy of the Moonblade]]

Tailored to Thana, where the Moonblade is received.

##### [[2-05. Echoes of the Celestial Realm]]

Tailored to Verity, where the Platinum Scarf is received.

##### [[2-06. The Draconic Phylactery]]

An opportunity to give more information about Arstyvrax and his undead nature, as well as to give them control over his phylactery. Potential to ally with Haze-of-Death as well.

##### Labyrinth of the Seeker

* An adventure should make heavy use of the Lantern of Seeking. Possibly embed several of the creature types as encounters in the dungeon, with the ability to bypass encounters and find multiple routes by using the lantern. Possibly a labyrinth with a Millitaur (ToB1).

##### The Crystal Library of Azalakardon

* Settings: Adar, The Tapestry of Argonnessen
* The Tapestry was conceived by a group of younger dragons 4000 years ago, who wanted to bring dragons of different colors together to exchange new ideas about religion, the Draconic Prophecy, and philosophy. These dragons were ignored by older dragons, until they successfully predicted the emergence of dragonmarks among humanoids. The Conclave then provided the Tapestry of Thought as a territory for these younger dragons to experiment and continue their work. Eventually the Conclave allowed these dragons to act outside of Argonnessen, resulting in the formation of the Chamber.
* Could be interesting if an extension of Crystal Library is actually found somewhere else, and the players can navigate it and emerge at the main Crystal Library in Argonnessen as a way to sneak onto the continent. Kind of like the Sanctuary intro of Zeda: A Link to the Past. Probably in Adar, amongst the blue dragons there (Aither's monastery head could send a letter as a hook).
* Monsters: Ink Devils (ToB1), Wind Dragon, Young? (ToB1), Library Automaton (ToB1), Paper Drake (ToB1), Repository (ToB2)

##### The Vast

* Final adventure where the players confront the obsidian dragons and try to prevent their ritual to release Tiamat.
* BBEG: Ancient Topaz Dragon (CR 20) used for [[Arstyvrax]].
* Monsters: Gem Stalker (FtoD), Andrenjinyi (ToB1), Haugbui (ToB1)

### Magic Items

##### [[Moonblade]]

Best for Thana, with some tie in to her family (as a +2 weapon). Most likely, this exact sword belonged to one of her parents and is her right to wield.

##### [[Dragon Claws]]

Best for Aither. When/if they get the Draakhorn and take on Megazord form, Aither is one of the hands.

##### [[Platinum Scarf]]

Best for Verity? The radiant damage could be a fun play with her fallen status.

##### [[Draakhorn]]

Final item that allows all of the PCs to use their Dragon Masks to create a larger form to take on the obsidian dragons.

##### Obsidian Annihilator

This re-branded Topaz Annihilator from Fizban's should be the ultimate weapon that they get from defeating the obsidian dragons. Or could give it earlier so they can use it on the final battle if it wouldn't entirely break the battle. Possibly it can't pierce obsidian dragon scales, since that's what powers it?

### DM Notes

* Use a Hoard Golem (ToB1, FToD) somewhere in an abandoned dragon lair with an unprotected hoard.
* If the players return to Shae Mordai, use the Haugbui (ToB1) as a boss monster.
* Slow Storm (ToB1) is a fun chaos-themed monster that should be used somewhere.
