The idea is to have a second set of adventures after the first prepared Sphinx adventures which are more specifically tailored toward the PCs and their needs and desires, as they prepare to take on the dragons. There should be some turning point before the second chapter - probably the attack on Sharn by the white dragons (where Valmoc should be wounded or even killed). By the end of chapter one, the PCs should have full knowledge of the dragon tribes, the attack on Shae Mordai by the obsidian dragons, and their leader's desire to revive the Overlord Tiamat. With the full breadth of their challenge revealed, they should be encouraged to seek out additional powerful weapons that will be needed to face the obsidian dragons.

### Adventure Concepts

* **Moonsword Jungle**
	* A temple in the depths of the Moonsword Jungle of Aerenal is rumored to house a lost [[Moonblade]] from one of the ancient elven houses. But this powerful weapon is protected by incredibly strong monsters.
	* Probably need to have the party at at least level 10 before going here, so do primarily CR 8 to 13 monsters.
	* Thana's uncle could be there when they arrive, and test the players in combat to ensure they're ready to enter.
	* I think the moonblade belonged to Thana's parents at one point, was held here for safe keeping, and was never able to be passed down to Thana due to their death. Then her parents could communicate to her through the blade in dream sequences.
	* Monsters: Possessed Pillar (ToB1), Young Moonstone Dragon (FToD), Lunarchidna (ToB2), Lunarian (ToB2), Moonkite (ToB2), Living Moonbeam?

* **The Mystic Glade** (see Dragons of Eberron, pg. 90-91) and **Vvaraak's Cave**
	* Former home of the black dragon Vvaraak, and now the central base of the Order of the Onyx Scale (Dragon Orcs) and the black dragon Moarâ€™donn as their leader.
	* Known as the Scaled Apostate, Vvaraak was the dragon who taught the orcs the traditions of the Gatekeepers some sixteen thousand years ago. Vvaraak died long ago, but her lair reportedly contains many mystical secrets relating to the Draconic Prophecy. The location of the cave was lost during the war against the daelkyr, and it is one of the mysteries of the Marches. Should it ever be found, the Gatekeepers would be greatly offended if outsiders despoiled this most holy site.
	* Monsters: Mavka (ToB1), Miremal (ToB1), Moss Lurker (ToB1), Swamp Naga (ToB2), Quickserpent (ToB2)

* **Speartip Island**
	* The original landing site of Lhazaar when she arrived in Khorvaire, and now a site of interest for the blue dragons and their leader Kalryni.
	* Enraged at the loss of a wyrmling, Kalryni is causing lightning storms to destroy coastal settlements near Speartip Island and refuses to stop until someone delivers the adventurer responsible.
	* This adventurer is Horget Black, the former High Prince (and therefore rival of Ryger), who actually found the wyrmling already wounded (after he fell from the sky onto his ship) and tried (but failed) to nurse it back to health, due to his being an incorporeal ghost. He has a ghost ship that is now stuck in the storm and unable to leave.
	* The players will need to find the ghost ship, and then return to Kalryni with Horget Black to explain what happened.
	* Monsters: Ravenala (ToB1), Morphoi (ToB1), Shimmer Seal (ToB2)

* **The Plane of Syrania**
	* Something to do with Verity's father?
	* Probably use the planar gate above Arcanix to get there, that way we can bring back elderly Windsor and Astra as well!

* **The Mournland**
	* Bring in Haze-of-Death (Kazdurakashtan), who was in Cyre on the Day of Mourning and was morphed into a monstrous version of himself.

	* Monsters: Vapor Lynx (ToB1), Corpse Mound (ToB1), Death Butterfly Swarm (ToB1), Living Spells

* **The Crystal Library of Azalakardon** (Adara, The Tapestry of Argonnessen)
	* The Tapestry was conceived by a group of younger dragons 4000 years ago, who wanted to bring dragons of different colors together to exchange new ideas about religion, the Draconic Prophecy, and philosophy. These dragons were ignored by older dragons, until they successfully predicted the emergence of dragonmarks among humanoids. The Conclave then provided the Tapestry of Thought as a territory for these younger dragons to experiment and continue their work. Eventually the Conclave allowed these dragons to act outside of Argonnessen, resulting in the formation of the Chamber.
	* Could be interesting if an extension of Crystal Library is actually found somewhere else, and the players can navigate it and emerge at the main Crystal Library in Argonnessen as a way to sneak onto the continent. Kind of like the Sanctuary intro of Zedal: A Link to the Past. Probably in Adar, amongst the blue dragons there (Aither's monastery head could send a letter as a hook).'
	* Monsters: Ink Devils (ToB1), Wind Dragon, Young? (ToB1), Library Automaton (ToB1), Paper Drake (ToB1), Repository (ToB2)

* **The Vast**
	* Final adventure where the players confront the obsidian dragons and try to prevent their ritual to release Tiamat.
	* Monsters: Gem Stalker (FtoD), Andrenjinyi (ToB1), Haugbui (ToB1)

### DM Notes

* Use a Hoard Golem (ToB1, FToD) somewhere in an abandoned dragon lair with an unprotected hoard.
* If the players return to Shae Mordai, use the Haugbui (ToB1) as a boss monster.
* Slow Storm (ToB1) is a fun chaose-themed monster that should be used somewhere.
