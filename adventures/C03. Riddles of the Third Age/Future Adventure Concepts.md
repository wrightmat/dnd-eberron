The idea is to have a second set of adventures after the first prepared Sphinx adventures which are more specifically tailored toward the PCs and their needs and desires, as they prepare to take on the dragons. There should be some turning point before the second chapter - probably the attack on Sharn by the white dragons (where Valmoc should be wounded or even killed). By the end of chapter one, the PCs should have full knowledge of the dragon tribes, the attack on Shae Mordai by the obsidian dragons, and their leader's desire to revive the Overlord Tiamat. With the full breadth of their challenge revealed, they should be encouraged to seek out additional powerful weapons that will be needed to face the obsidian dragons.

* Moonsword Jungle
	* A temple in the depths of the Moonsword Jungle of Aerenal is rumored to house a lost [[Moonblade]] from one of the ancient elven houses. But this powerful weapon is protected by incredibly strong monsters.
	* Probably need to have the party at at least level 10 before going here, so do primarily CR 8 to 13 monsters.

* Speartip Island
	* The original landing site of Lhazaar when she arrived in Khorvaire, and now a site of interest for the blue dragons and their leader Kalryni.
	* Somehow include Horget Black, the former High Prince (and therefore rival of Ryger). Possibly he's settled on the island, or has a ghost ship that is tethered to the region because of his failures.

* The Mystic Glade (see Dragons of Eberron, pg. 90-91) and Vvaraak's Cave
	* Former home of the black dragon Vvaraak, and now the central base of the Order of the Onyx Scale (Dragon Orcs) and the black dragon Moarâ€™donn as their leader.
	* Known as the Scaled Apostate, Vvaraak was the dragon who taught the orcs the traditions of the Gatekeepers some sixteen thousand years ago. Vvaraak died long ago, but her lair reportedly contains many mystical secrets relating to the Draconic Prophecy. The location of the cave was lost during the war against the daelkyr, and it is one of the mysteries of the Marches. Should it ever be found, the Gatekeepers would be greatly offended if outsiders despoiled this most holy site

* The Mournland
	* Bring in Haze-of-Death (Kazdurakashtan), who was in Cyre on the Day of Mourning and was morphed into a monstrous version of himself.

* The Vast
	* Final adventure where the players confront the obsidian dragons and try to prevent their ritual to release Tiamat.
