### Background and Hook(s)

* Tahorep informs the players that Shae Mordai was an important elven city, and that many of the elves who survived and fled likely landed in Valenar.

### Characters and Locations

* **Valgutanu** (Equisphinx)
* **Shan Kaelan**. The lord of Taer Valior.
* **[[Gunnora]]**. Owner of the Elven Arms armory.

* **Taer Valior**
* **Blade Desert**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Taer Zanathar** (nearby city)

* Medium-sized fort city with basic shops, armorers, and weapon smiths (plus a newly opened Copper Dragon Inn).

* **Lord's Manor**. Home of the lord of the fortress, Shan Kaelan.
* **Copper Dragon Inn**. Opened a few years ago, when it was converted from an old run-down local inn. A troupe of dragonborn bards, calling themselves the Brass Bards, began performing here several months ago.
* **Elven Arms**: A armory run by a half-elf named [[Gunnora]], which serves as the primary shop for weapons and armor, as well as the blacksmithy.

 - [ ]  **Approaching Blade Coliseum** (Blade Desert)

>An ancient but once grand coliseum stands as a testament to the courage and valor of ancient warriors. Massive sandstone walls rise high above, adorned with faded murals depicting epic battles and tales of triumph. Torch sconces line the walls, casting flickering shadows that dance across the ground.

* Inside the coliseum, the arena is quartered into four sections. The final section contains a staircase that leads to an underground chamber serving as the sphinx's lair.

 - [ ]  **Pillars of Peril**

>As you enter the open space, your gaze is drawn upward to the towering stone pillars that stretch into the bright sky above. Their imposing presence dwarfs you, instilling a sense of awe and insignificance in the face of their immense strength and endurance.

* Each pillar can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. A successful DC 10 Investigation check (made with disadvantage from the ground) reveals ropes that connect the pillars to each other and to the far wall.
* Immediately after the players arrive, a group (one for each member of the party minus one, or 1d6) of insectoid monsters emerge from the ground - roll initiative! Roll a d6 on each of the Kruthik's turns - on an even number it uses its Multiattack, and on an odd number it takes its action to burrow through the nearest pillar with a PC on/near it (weakening the pillar and increasing the DC of any pillar-related checks by one).

   `encounter: 1d6: Adult Kruthik`

* To escape completely, players must get up a 50 foot tall pillar and then climb across two ropes to get to the next chamber (add one more if they climb up the nearest pillar, and subtract one if they climb up the furthest pillar). Each of these is a DC 12 Athletics or Acrobatics check, where the PC falls to the ground on a failure, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage.

 - [ ]  **Pit of Bravery**: Taming the Elemental Flame

>Just as you climb down into the next chamber, your senses are overwhelmed by the sight and heat of an uncontrolled flame that immediately flares up. Its raging inferno is quickly filling the room, blocking your path forward, while braziers dot the walls, casting flickering shadows across the fiery chaos.

* PCs must subdue or harness the flame's power to advance. They can use spells, skills, or magical items to pacify the flame or redirect its energy into braziers. Players may use various spells (like Control Flames, Create Water) or skills (like Arcana or Persuasion) to control the elemental flame. Failure might result in taking fire damage or triggering the flame to spread.

 - [ ]  **Gates of Valor**

>Before you stand two colossal gates, their sheer size blocking the path forward. In between them lies a deep, 15-foot wide pit, its depths hidden in darkness. If there is a way to lift the gates, it is not immediately apparent.

* This chamber is composed of a series of two massive gates blocking the path forward. To proceed, players must succeed in a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to lift them or search for the gate's hidden mechanism with a DC 15 Investigation check. In between the two gates is a large 15 foot wide pit, which may be traversed by creating a magical bridge of some sort of by jumping across (long jump distance equal to Strength score).
* Collapsing Floor Trap. Pressure plates hidden beneath the floor trigger if the gate is lifted without checking for traps. A DC 12 Perception check will reveal the trap. This trap requires a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to leap clear of the collapsing floor, with failure resulting in falling into the pit and taking bludgeoning damage from the impact.
* The pit is 40 feet deep, so falling in results in `dice: 4d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of Courage**

>As you enter the chamber, you are greeted by an array of floating mirrors, their surfaces shimmering with an ethereal glow. The room itself is cavernous, with shorter stone pillars rising up from the sandy floor, directing the eye toward a staircase down. The air is dry and dusty, carrying with it the faint scent of ancient sandstone and desert winds.

* This chamber contains a number of floating mirrors equal to the number of members in the party. Each contains a Mirror Wraith that's revealed when any player looks into a mirror, reflecting back a distorted version of themselves that then emerges from the mirror and attacks.

> As you gaze into the mirror, the reflection begins to ripple and distort. Suddenly, an ominous figure emerges from within, its features mirroring your own, but twisted with a malevolent aura. The air grows colder as the Mirror Wraith steps through, ready to confront you with your deepest fears.

   `encounter: 4: Mirror Wraith`

 - [ ]  **Weight and Switch**

>As you descend into this chamber, you are greeted by a sight of grandeur and awe. The chamber is adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of heroic triumph and valor, illuminated by the soft glow of ancient torches. At the center of the chamber, atop a raised plinth, rests a magnificent Green Dragon Mask, its emerald hues shimmering in the dim light. Nearby, a small pedestal holds a humble-looking stone idol, its surface worn and weathered by the passage of time.

* An inscription etched into the pedestal hints at its purpose: "To claim the mask, exchange the old for the new, and courage shall guide you."
* The mask plinth is trapped, and the mask can only be removed if replaced by something of a similar weight (the stone idol). A DC 12 Strength (Sleight of Hand) check is needed to successfully swap the idol with the mask. Failure to perform the swap, or failure on the check, results in a large bolt firing from one of the wall carvings, causing `dice: 2d10` piercing damage to the target. A DC 12 Perception check reveals the presence of a pressure plate under the dragon mask.
* The stone idol is a worn but still regal looking sphinx-like creature. It actually depicts Reigney, the king of the sphinxes, but the players would have no way of knowing this (any History checks performed with disadvantage).

 - [ ]  **Lair of the Fearless Guardian**

>You descend into a large chamber with an elevated platform, where a large creature bearing the head of a horse, body of a lion, wings of an eagle stands fearlessly.

* Valgutanu should fill in some of the lore about the dragons, alluding to that fact that their increased prevalence across Khorvaire may not be a good thing.

>"To conquer fear is to embrace the truest form of strength. Stand resolute, and let courage be your guiding light. Your strength has been tested, and you have been found worthy. I am at your service," the sphinx says, while bowing deeply.
