### Background and Hook(s)

* Tahorep informs the players that Shae Mordai was an important elven city, and that many of the elves who survived and fled likely landed in Valenar.

### Characters and Locations

* **Valgutanu** (Equisphinx)
* **Shan Kaelan**. The lord of Taer Valior.
* **[[Gunnora]]**. Owner of the Elven Arms armory.

* **Taer Valior**
* **Blade Desert**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Taer Zanathar** (nearby city)

* Medium-sized fort city with basic shops, armorers, and weapon smiths (plus a newly opened Copper Dragon Inn).

* **Lord's Manor**. Home of the lord of the fortress, Shan Kaelan.
* **Copper Dragon Inn**. Opened a few years ago, when it was converted from an old run-down local inn. A troupe of dragonborn bards, calling themselves the Brass Bards, began performing here several months ago.
* **Elven Arms**: A armory run by a half-elf named [[Gunnora]], which serves as the primary shop for weapons and armor, as well as the blacksmithy.

 - [ ]  **Approaching Blade Coliseum** (Blade Desert)

* Inside the coliseum, the arena is quartered into four sections. The final section contains a staircase that leads to an underground chamber serving as the Sphinx's lair.

>An ancient but once grand coliseum stands as a testament to the courage and valor of ancient warriors. Massive sandstone walls rise high above, adorned with faded murals depicting epic battles and tales of triumph. Torch sconces line the walls, casting flickering shadows that dance across the ground.

 - [ ]  **Pillars of Peril**

* As the players enter the coliseum, they see an open space dominated only by towering stone pillars. Each pillar can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. A successful DC 10 Investigation check (made with disadvantage from the ground) reveals ropes that connect the pillars to each other and to the far wall. Immediately after the players arrive, a group (one for each member of the party minus one, or 1d6) of insectoid monsters enters the chamber - roll initiative! Roll a d6 on each of the Kruthik's turns - on an even number it uses its Multiattack, and on an odd number it takes its action to burrow through the nearest pillar with a PC on/near it (weakening the pillar and increasing the DC of any pillar-related checks by one).

   `encounter: 1d6: Adult Kruthik`

* To escape completely, players must get up a 50 foot tall pillar and then climb across two ropes to get to the next chamber (add one more if they climb up the nearest pillar, and subtract one if they climb up the furthest pillar). Each of these is a DC 12 Athletics or Acrobatics check, where the PC falls to the ground on a failure, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage.

 - [ ]  **Pit of Bravery**: Taming the Elemental Flame

* This chamber is filled with an uncontrolled elemental flame. Players must subdue or harness the flame's power to advance. They can use spells, skills, or magical items to pacify the flame or redirect its energy into braziers. Players may use various spells (like Control Flames, Create Water) or skills (like Arcana or Persuasion) to control the elemental flame. Failure might result in taking fire damage or triggering the flame to spread.

 - [ ]  **Gates of Valor**

* This chamber is composed of a series of two massive gates blocking the path forward. To proceed, players must succeed in a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to lift them or search for the gate's hidden mechanism with a DC 15 Investigation check. In between the two gates is a large 15 foot pit, which may be traversed by creating a magical bridge of some sort of by jumping across (long jump distance equal to Strength score).

 - [ ]  **Chamber of Courage**

* This chamber contains a number of floating mirrors equal to the number of members in the party. Each contains a Mirror Wraith that's revealed when any player looks into a mirror, reflecting back a distorted version of themselves that then emerges from the mirror and attacks.

   `encounter: 4: Mirror Wraith`

> As you gaze into the mirror, the reflection begins to ripple and distort. Suddenly, an ominous figure emerges from within, its features mirroring your own, but twisted with a malevolent aura. The air grows colder as the Mirror Wraith steps through, ready to confront you with your deepest fears.

 - [ ]  **Lair of the Fearless Guardian**

>You descend into a large chamber with an elevated platform, where a large creature bearing the head of a horse, body of a lion, wings of an eagle stands fearlessly.

* Valrok should reward the PCs with the Green [[Dragon Mask]], and fill in some of the lore about the dragons, alluding to that fact that their increased prevalence across Khorvaire may not be a good thing.

>"To conquer fear is to embrace the truest form of strength. Stand resolute, and let courage be your guiding light. Your strength has been tested, and you have been found worthy. I am at your service," the sphinx says, while bowing deeply.

### Secrets and Clues

 - [x]  Several elves who barely escaped Shae Mordai alive are certain that the attack was performed by Obsidian dragons. But no one has seen any Obsidian dragons since.
 - [ ]  Several years ago, a single ship of bronze dragonborn landed in the port city of Pylas Maradal. Rumor is they've been working with House Lyrandar to build more ships.
 - [ ]  Several months ago, a traveling comedy troupe of brass dragonborn, known as the Brass Bards, began to perform at the newly opened Copper Dragon Inn. Rumor is they originated from Zilargo.
 - [x]  The capital city of Aerenal, Shae Cairdal, has been putting out calls for help to any elves, as strange spectral creatures have been emerging from the nearby Moonblade Jungle.
