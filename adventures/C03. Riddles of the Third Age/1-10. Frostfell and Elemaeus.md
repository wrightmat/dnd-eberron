### Background and Hook(s)

* The Map of Sphinx Sightings has a few visible markings indicating sightings in the area.
* 

### Characters and Locations

* **Elemaeus** (Leucosphinx)

* **Icewhite Island**. The largest of the "children islands" in the southern section of Frostfell, and home of the Dragon Giants (Order of the Ivory Scale).
* **Icerazer**. A city of spires that sits atop of glacial formation, elevated to protect it from the dangerous creatures that roam the Frostfell.

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **Navigating Icewhite Island**

* This scene is handled in 10 minute "dungeon" rounds, where each player gets an (optional) turn each round. Marching order can be declared, or initialtive rolled, and that order used throughout this scene.
* Starting out the scene, and at the top of each hour (six rounds, can optionally use a clock), a new roll against the Extreme Cold conditions is made (unless the cold is negated in some way).
> [!info]- Extreme Cold
>Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
* Each round, roll on the random table to determine what the PCs encounter during the next 10 minutes, then go through the regular turn order.
* In a TPK situation (such as if everyone succumbs to the Extreme Cold), the PCs wake up in Icerazer (see below).
* The PCs may find the sphinx's lair either by random roll, using their action to search for it, asking during a social encounter, or possibly being directed by someone in Icerazer. If searching (using their action or after being direction), they'll need to succeed on a DC 12 Survival check (at advantage if using the Lantern of Seeking) to actually find it (with a failure resulting in a new round starting with a random roll on the table).
* **Dark Gift of Winter.** Dral Khatuur teaches you to embrace the killing cold. Whenever you would take cold damage, you instead gain that many temporary hit points.

 - [ ]  **Icerazer** (nearby town)

* **Order of the Ivory Scale**. A subset of frost giants still revere and worship the dragons, specifically a white dragon who once lived nearby named Kazdurakashtan. He went missing and presumed dead several generations ago (about a hundred years), but the Order still adheres to his teachings of persistence in the face of adversity.
* **Temple of Dral Khatuur**. Dral Khatuur, called the Heart of Winter and the Killing Cold, is one of the fiendish Overlords that ruled Eberron during the Age of Demons. She has dominion over cold and winter. The frost giants here revere her.
* **Thrym Hound Stable**. Some thrym hounds live wild, whereas others serve frost giants as steeds and hunting companions, such as those housed in Icerazer. These hounds have their sharp, spiny fur trimmed in order to make room for a saddle, but even frost giants need to be careful where to put their hands. A thrym hound is the size of an elephant, standing ten feet high at the shoulder and weighing more than 6 tons.
>_This wolf-like creature has a pelt of jagged ice crystals instead of fur. It stands as tall as a house, glaring with baleful white eyes._

 - [ ]  **Elmaeus' Lair Entrance**

>As you approach the frozen cavern's entrance, a towering door looms before you, encased in a thick layer of ice. The cold air bites at your skin, and the eerie silence of the frozen landscape fills you with a sense of foreboding. Only the faintest glimmer of light pierces through the frost-covered doorway, hinting at the chilling challenges that lie beyond. Metal plates decorate either side of the door.

* The large door to the lair is frozen over. Two metallic plate switches can be seen on either side of the door. If both switches are pressed at the same time by different PCs, while they're holding hands to complete the circuit, an electrical surge pulses through the door and shatters the ice. A DC 10 Constitution saving throw is needed to resist the extreme cold of the metal plates.
* Alternatively, a player may decide to cast a fire spell of some sort to melt the door. In this case, they're hit by a blast of cold air as they cast the spell, requiring a DC 10 Concentration saving throw.
* Checks against Extreme Cold are generally not required while within the lair (past this room, which is because of the Frostfire Forge found later, but the PCs would not know this).

 - [ ]  -

* Holding breath underwater. Maybe a series or levers or switches under water? Or even better, the room floods immediately after entering so all of the players are challenged.

 - [ ]  **Frostfire Forge**

* Deep within the cavern, the players discover a forge filed with blue flames, radiating intense heat amid the icy environment. A powerful elemental guardian stands watch over the forge, ready to challenge any intruders.
* PCs must make a check against Extreme Heat in this room.


 - [ ]  -

* Athletics (Con) checks to race against someone/something? And/or low oxygen environment that requires CON checks for breathing?

 - [ ]  **Glacial Sanctuary**

* At the heart of the cavern lies a serene glacial sanctuary, where a mystical artifact rests atop an icy pedestal. The aura of the artifact radiates with both cold and power, beckoning the players closer.
* Anyone succeeding on a DC 12 Perception check notices that the artifact is a White [[Dragon Mask]].
* To claim the artifact, players must endure the numbing cold of the mask's Cold Breath, which exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Resilient Guardian**

* Elemaeus should...?

| dice: 1d20 | Encounter |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | `encounter: 1: Coldlight Walker` |
| 2 | `encounter: 1d3: Snowy Owlbear` |
| 3 | `encounter: 1d3: Snow Golem` |
| 4 | `encounter: 1d8: Ice Mephits` |
| 5 | `encounter: 1d20: Icewind Kobold` (swarm) |
| 6 | **Blinding Snow.** Gusts of wind throw blistering blasts of snow at the party. PCs must make a saving throw against Extreme Cold, with a failure resulting in blindness. The blindness lasts until the character finishes a short rest. |
| 7 | **Thin Ice.** Patches of ice are covered in snow and are difficult to avoid. Each PC must attempt a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, with anyone failing plunging into the ice-cold water below and making a new Extreme Cold roll. If more than half the party fails, the party is delayed and they lose an entire round (no actions, start with a new Extreme Cold roll). |
| 8 | **Razor Ice.** Thin sharp blades of ice whip past on the wind. Their abrupt appearance makes it impossible for the party to avoid them. Make a +5 attack roll against each character. On a hit, a character takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage. |
| 9-10 | **White Out.** The snow has become so thick and constant that it is difficult to maintain the party's path. The group must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check. If more than half the party fails, they lose an entire round (no actions, start with a new Extreme Cold roll). |
| 11-12 | **Altar to Dral Khatuur.** A pillar made of ice holds atop it an orb of what appears to be blue fire. An inscription on the pillar, written in Giant, asks the reader to "Touch the Orb and embrace the Dark Gift of Winter". Anyone touching the orb gains the Dark Gift of Winter for 28 days. |
| 13 | **[[Avarice]].** A social encounter where the PCs meet a cruel tiefling who attempts to steal any of their magic items, and then flee (but can be found again later in Icerazer). Roll a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (+3) for each player, contested be their passive Perception. Any players failing lose an item they're carrying without noticing. |
| 14-15 | **Glacier Dwarf Settlement.** The PCs come upon a small settlement of `dice: 1d6`glacier dwarves. Roll on the Initial Attitude to determine how the dwarves regard them. If friendly, they may teach the players about the Frostfell or direct them wherever they would like to go (resulting in them finding that location on their next turn without randomly rolling). |
| 16 | **Risia Manifest Zone.** The PCs find themselves on the outskirts of a manifest zone to Risia, the plane of ice. A Rejkar (basically a giant white ram) can be seen in the distance. Players making a successful DC 12 Intelligent (Arcana) check will know the nature of this manifest zone, and that proceeding further would result in them being in Risia instead of the Frostfell. |
| 17 | **Tialusk Sighting.** The PCs spot a Tialusk (a huge six-legged mammoth roaming the island in search of its lichen food) in the distance. |
| 18-19 | **Icerazer.** See below. |
| 20 | **Elemaeus' Lair Entrance.** See below. |
