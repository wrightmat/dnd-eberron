 #adventure [[Thrane]]

### Background and Hook(s)

* Flamewind directs the players to where sightings have been reported in Thrane, specifically she thinks somewhere near Athandra.

### Characters and Locations

* **Theme**: Riddles
* **Description**: A traditional Egypt-inspired temple to introduce the concept of the sphinxes.
* **Item(s)**: [[Orb of Dragonkind]], [[Map of Sphinx Sightings]]
* **Sphinx**: Tahorep (Androsphinx)
	* **Personality:** Wise and somewhat aloof, Tahorep values intellect and seeks to guide mortals through their journey, though his pride can sometimes lead to cryptic or enigmatic responses.
	- **Dialogue:** Tahorep imparts cryptic wisdom about the balance between law and chaos, warning the players of the dangers posed by the dragons' chaotic influence. He also entrusts them with the Orb of Dragonkind, a glowing orb that reveals hidden truths about the dragons' plans and their influence in the world.

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ] **Athandra** (nearby town)

* Has only basic services, such as a small shop and inn, a temple, and is known for a special store called the Everlight Emporium.

* **Everlight Emporium**. The shopkeeper, a human man named Erasmus Everlight, is a different age every time the players enter the shop, but Erasmus himself doesn't seem to notice. He carries with him, and can be convinced to sell, an ancient lantern that he claims can be used to seek out magical creatures ([[Lantern of Seeking]], with a yellow gem already in place so it can be used to find sphinxes, costing 250gp).
* **Temple of the Silver Flame**. A traditional Silver Flame temple with a statue being taken down outside (formerly of the Keeper of the Flame, who just died). Inside, which is draped in black curtains, is a priest named Father Gregori who runs the temple.

 - [ ]  **Finding the temple**

* Two successful DC 14 Survival or Arcana checks, made with advantage if using the lantern, must be made to find the temple. Failure results in the party getting lost, running into a group of dust mephits (one per party member), and ending up back in Athandra.

 - [ ]  **Approaching the temple**

>Ahead, the landscape gradually transforms, betraying signs of an ancient civilization frozen in time. Massive sandstone pillars, weathered by the passage of countless ages, rise like silent sentinels, adorned with intricate hieroglyphs that tell tales of forgotten epochs. The very air seems to thicken with an enigmatic aura, carrying the whispers of bygone eras.
>The entrance to an underground temple stands before you, a colossal stone archway covered with ornate carvings of celestial creatures and inscriptions in an ancient script that seems to beckon to the curious and the brave.
>As you draw nearer, the heat of the sun begins to wane, replaced by a cool, almost mystical breeze that carries hints of sandalwood and myrrh. The entrance, flanked by twin statues of sphinxes carved from solid granite, exudes an air of imposing grandeur.
>The rhythmic echoes of your footsteps on the sun-baked earth are soon engulfed by the solemn silence that envelops this sacred place. In the distance, the flickering light of torches illuminates the dim passage beyond, hinting at untold secrets and challenges waiting to be uncovered beneath the sands of time.

 - [ ]  **Entrance Hall**

>You enter a grand entrance hall with towering columns and intricate hieroglyphics on the walls, depicting the history of Thrane. A massive stone door on the far side of the room appears to have text written above it.

- **Riddle 1 (Entrance Riddle):** "I am a mystery that cannot be unraveled, a secret that cannot be revealed. What am I?" (Answer: a riddle). Answering the riddle correctly opens the door, leading onward.

 - [ ]  **Hall of Trials**

>You walk through a series of interconnected chambers with intricate murals depicting ancient sphinxes bestowing wisdom upon mortals. There are three doorways, each leading to a different room to the east, west, and north.

- **Combat Encounter:** The east and west rooms each contain two animated stone statues that come to life, wielding ancient weapons, representing a trial by combat to test the players' prowess. The room to the north continues on. If at least one statue is defeated, it drops the [[Orb of Dragonkind]].

  `encounter: 2: Clockwork Stone Defender`

 - [ ]  **Chamber of Reflection**

>You come upon a serene room with a reflective pool at the center, surrounded by intricately designed radial pools that seem to reflect different versions of reality. The air is filled with a calming, mysterious aura. A stone pedestal near the pool appears to have writing on it.

- **Puzzle:** As the players step into the chamber, a set of riddles appear on a stone pedestal near the pool, with corresponding symbols etched into the pools around the room. The riddles read:
    - Riddle 1: "I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?" (Map)
    - Riddle 2: "The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?" (Footprints)
    - Riddle 3: "I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch will soon turn red. What am I?" (Fire)

- **Mechanics:** Each radial pool has a specific symbol etched into it, corresponding to a potential answer for each riddle. When the players correctly answer a riddle, the corresponding symbol lights up in the pool. However, if they answer incorrectly, a surge of magical energy is released, dealing 1d10 force damage. The pool's reflections change to provide hints or clues when the players are stuck, guiding them toward the correct answers.

The players must solve all three riddles correctly to unlock the hidden doorway, allowing them to proceed deeper into the lair.

 - [ ]  **Library of Ages**

>You discover a vast chamber filled with shelves of ancient tomes and scrolls, containing knowledge untold. The room is dimly lit, and the air is heavy with the scent of ancient parchment. A large stone door has something written above it.

- **Riddle 2 (Library Door Riddle):** "I am a silent guardian, full of stories untold. Those who seek my knowledge must decipher the ancient code. What am I?" (Answer: an ancient tome)
- The books contain knowledge about the history of Eberron and the enigmatic sphinxes. Any Intelligence check made to learn about any of these subjects gets a +2 bonus.

 - [ ]  **Chamber of the Wise Guardian**

>You come upon a large chamber with an elevated platform, where a large male sphinx is perched. The creature has a regal demeanor, adorned with ancient symbols of wisdom and power, bearing a full lion's mane the wings of a mighty eagle.

* Tahorep should give the players the [[Map of Sphinx Sightings]] (a map of known sphinx sightings across Khorvaire). He can also give basic information about the [[Orb of Dragonkind]], if it was found.

### Secrets and Clues

 - [ ]  The Orb of Dragonkind is a powerful artifact tied to the dragons, but can be dangerous for non-dragons to wield.
 - [ ]  The map of sphinx sightings has a secret - it contains other information hidden from view, only visible to those who wield a special artifact.
