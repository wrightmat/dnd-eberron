### Background and Hook(s)

* The Tapestry was conceived by a group of younger dragons 4000 years ago, who wanted to bring dragons of different colors together to exchange new ideas about religion, the Draconic Prophecy, and philosophy. These dragons were ignored by older dragons, until they successfully predicted the emergence of dragonmarks among humanoids. The Conclave then provided the Tapestry of Thought as a territory for these younger dragons to experiment and continue their work. Eventually the Conclave allowed these dragons to act outside of Argonnessen, resulting in the formation of the Chamber.
* The blue dragon Azalakardon was one of the greatest students of the Prophecy, but he grew paranoid and reclusive. Tales say he unearthed knowledge that slowly drove him mad. Whatever the truth, Azalakardon is long gone. His library, said to be one of the greatest repositories of both arcane and Prophecy lore, lies hidden by epic magic, waiting to be rediscovered.

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Hidden Entrance

 - [ ]  **Discovery**

The players discover the hidden extension of the Crystal Library near Aither's monastery. An ancient guardian, a Library Automaton, initially bars their way, programmed to test the worthiness of those who seek to enter.

 - [ ]  **Challenge**

To gain entry, the players must either decipher a series of arcane runes that act as a lock (a puzzle that requires knowledge of magical lore) or prove their worth in a skirmish with the Automaton, showcasing their strength and determination.

##### 2: The Labyrinth of Lore

 - [ ]  **The Labyrinth**

Inside, the library is a maze of crystal corridors filled with Ink Devils and Paper Drakes, mischievous creatures that rearrange the paths and rooms to confuse intruders.

 - [ ]  **The Archives**

Aither and/or recognizes some of the library's layout from her studies and leads the group to a secluded archive. Here, they must solve a puzzle involving ancient tomes that reveal the secret path to Argonnessen, while also learning valuable information about their final destination and the enemies they will face.

##### 3: The Gale Halls

 - [ ]  **Wind's Whispers**

As they navigate deeper, they encounter halls guarded by the essence of a Wind Dragon, creating powerful gusts that threaten to push them back or separate them.

 - [ ]  **The Repository**

In these halls lies a Repository, a sentient library entity that offers knowledge in exchange for memories or secrets. Dealing with the Repository can provide shortcuts or aid in their journey but at a potentially steep price.

##### 4: The Chamber of Echoes

 - [ ]  **Confrontation**

Reaching the heart of the library, they face the chief librarian â€” a transformed Repository that has absorbed too much forbidden knowledge and seeks to prevent anyone from reaching Argonnessen.

 - [ ]  **Resolution**

The battle tests not just their combat prowess but their ability to use the environment to their advantage, manipulating the crystal structures to create reflections and illusions that confuse the Repository.

##### 5: The Portal to Argonnessen

 - [ ]  **The Portal**

With the Repository defeated, the true heart of the library reveals itself: a crystal portal that leads directly to Argonnessen. This portal, powered by the library's vast knowledge, requires them to contribute a piece of their own lore to activate.

 - [ ]  **Revelation**

As they step through the portal, they find themselves not just in another location but in a time slightly ahead of when they left, providing them with unexpected insights into their enemy's movements. They also realize the library has chosen them as its new guardians, linking their fates to its vast, magical network and setting up future adventures tied to the defense and exploration of its knowledge.
