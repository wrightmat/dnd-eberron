### Background and Hook(s)

* The Tapestry was conceived by a group of younger dragons 4,000 years ago, who wanted to bring dragons of different colors together to exchange new ideas about religion, the Draconic Prophecy, and philosophy. These dragons were ignored by older dragons, until they successfully predicted the emergence of dragonmarks among humanoids. The Conclave then provided the Tapestry of Thought as a territory for these younger dragons to experiment and continue their work. Eventually the Conclave allowed these dragons to act outside of Argonnessen, resulting in the formation of the Chamber.
* The blue dragon Azalakardon was one of the greatest students of the Prophecy, but he grew paranoid and reclusive. Tales say he unearthed knowledge that slowly drove him mad. Whatever the truth, Azalakardon is long gone. His library, said to be one of the greatest repositories of both arcane and Prophecy lore, lies hidden by epic magic, waiting to be rediscovered.
* The head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, sends a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.

### Characters and Locations

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Hidden Entrance

 - [ ]  **Gaining Access**

- When the players arrive in Adar, the Unity Games are underway. Anyone at Aither's monastery (Kasshta Keep) would be aware of the strange happenings with the blue dragons, and assume the cause is powerful magic emanating from a nearby mountain. But unfortunately for the players, no one is allowed to access the former monastery, except those competing in the final event of the Unity Games, which takes place in the area. So the players will likely have to enter the games in order to get where they need to go.
- The Unity Games is composed of a bracket system of three rounds, with only the final two champions facing off in the final event. Contenders can choose their events, and those with the most number of points at the end of each round move on. Random NPCs compose any slots not taken up by players, and their points should be randomly determined by a roll of `dice:1d6+4` (or by rolls during the event if facing off against a PC).

 - [ ]  **The Monastic Tunnel**

- The newly unearthed tunnel by the monks of Shalquar monastery. Ancient, worn, and partially collapsed, signs of recent excavation are evident. Navigating through unstable sections requires careful movement or risk causing a collapse.
- Seemingly random vibrations shake this 100 foot long tunnel as the players move through it. Have PCs roll initiative when they enter the tunnel. At initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the tunnel shakes, rocks fall where the characters are located, and each player must make a DC 12 Dexterity save to avoid falling prone.

 - [ ]  **The Guardian**

- The players discover the hidden entrance of the Crystal Library at the end of the tunnel. When they get to within 30 feet of the entrance, they can clearly see its guardian.
- An ancient guardian, a Young Wind Dragon, initially bars the way, protecting the ancient home of his ancestor. It opens up combat using its last lair action (a torrent of wind).

`encounter: 1: Young Wind Dragon`

**Lair Actions**. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.
- Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.
- Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.
- A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.

 - [ ]  **The Codex Gate**

- The entrance to the Crystal Library of Azalakardon is sealed by a large door known as the Codex Gate. This door is covered with panels that resemble the pages of a massive book. The door does not have a conventional handle or keyhole but is instead unlocked by arranging the panels to form a coherent narrative.
- If players fail in the arrangement, symbols glow red briefly, and the panels shuffle randomly, requiring the players to start over. If they fail multiple times, a protective charm triggers, releasing a minor arcane shock (dealing `dice:1d12` lightning damage) to discourage brute force attempts.
	- Panel A: "Born from storms of thought, a guardian of deep knowledge emerged, his scales an endless azure."
	- Panel B: "He shaped fate with whispers, a master of destinies, guiding the wills of many."
	- Panel C: "Dark visions clouded his sky, doubts where once there was certainty."
	- Panel D: "He retreated to a fortress of books, his voice lost in the silence of isolation."
	- Panel E: "He vanished, leaving behind mysteries in a sanctum of abandoned echoes."
* **Hints**. Symbols in Draconic can be found with a successful DC 12 Investigation check, revealing hints about the order (such as the first saying "storm", etc).

##### 2: The Labyrinth of Lore

 - [ ]  **The Stacks**

- Inside, the library is a maze of corridors filled with books and populated with Ink Devils and Paper Drakes, mischievous creatures that rearrange the paths and rooms to confuse intruders. Interestingly, if any of the books are opened, they are totally blank. These books are actually decoys, and the entire chamber is a guise to keep interlopers out of the true Crystal Library.
- In order to navigate the stacks, players will need to succeed in a series of three successful Intelligence (Survival) checks, with the DC starting at 12 and increasing by 2 for each subsequent check.
- On a first failure, an Ink Devil confronts the party, handing them a random tome. If the book is opened, a *[[glyph of warding]]* goes off, and the Ink Devil attacks.
- On a second failure, the players find themselves in a corridor lined with folded paper on bookshelves that are actually paper drakes.

`encounter: 1: Ink Devil`
`encounter: 1d4+1: Paper Drake`

 - [ ]  **The Archives**

- After navigating their way through the stacks, the players find themselves in a study room, but they immediately notice that they're all alone. On a single table in the room is a glowing book, which when touched or opened sends the player to their own specific mental challenge, guided by an individual that's important to them. The intent is to provide a test which reinforces the idea of "strategy beats strength". Cut between scenes/players as needed to keep things interested (definitely switching if a scene resets).

>You find yourself in a dreamlike monastery courtyard, filled with floating lanterns that emit a gentle, soothing light. The air is serene, and moving gently. Standing in front of you is a figure you immediately recognize, your once mentor Chanaakar, the former Speaker of the Word. He bows to you, signaling the start of your training session.
* **Aither**
	* **Guide**: Chanaakar, the former Speaker of the Word (and Aither's original mentor).
	* Challenge: Bō staff training (two handed, 1d8 bludgeoning damage), during which any strikes against Chanaakar return twice the bludgeoning damage to Aither on a return hit (any non-retaliatory strikes made by him deal the maximum 8 bludgeoning damage). The idea is to use strategy to escape the reach of Chanaakar to a glowing book on the ground in the distance (120 feet away, discovered with a DC 12 Perception/Investigation check). If reduced to zero hit points, Aither wakes back up on the floor of the ring and starts the challenge over. Chanaaker should continue to strike at Aither and progress through the dialog below as the scene progresses, beginning with the first line immediately after Aither comes to standing in the arena.
	* "Do you know why we use the staff, Aither? It is merely an extension of one’s limbs. At times we must make ourselves larger in order to take on those more powerful than ourselves. The staff is an extension of your will, not merely a weapon. Its power lies not in brute force, but in the precision of its movement and the wisdom of its wielder." Chanaaker moves and spins his staff through the air skillfully, and strikes you across the mid-section, sending a sharp pain through your abdomen.
	* "Strength alone is like a river that rages uncontrolled. It may be mighty, but it is also blind. Strategy is the guiding hand that shapes the flow, turning raw power into a focused stream."
	* "Remember your forms, postulant. Some emphasize control and agility, allowing you to move swiftly and accurately, making every strike precise. A well-executed form is like a dance, each movement flowing seamlessly into the next. Others rely on raw force to overpower an opponent. While strength can break through barriers, it often lacks the finesse and adaptability of dexterity."
	* "In battle, the mind must be like still water — clear and reflective. Only then can you see the true path. Reacting without thought is the folly of the strong; anticipating with wisdom is the art of the strategist. Strength can break walls, but strategy can move mountains. Remember this, Aither: The wise warrior knows when to strike, but more importantly, they know when not to."
	* If at this point Aither hasn't discovered the book, then Chanaakar bows to her again, signaling the end of their training, and walks away without another word. Aither then sees the book in the distance, and can approach it unopposed.

>Cold, damp air envelops you. Dim light from ethereal torches flickers along the walls, casting long, dancing shadows. Rows of stone sarcophagi, etched with ancient elven runes, stretch into the darkness. You recognize this place — the sacred catacombs of the Undying Court in Shae Mordai, where your ancestors, including your beloved Mee-maw, rest in eternal vigil. Then, from the shadows, that exact familiar figure steps forward.
* **Thana**.
	* **Guide**: Mee-maw, Thana's grandmother.
	* Thana must navigate the catacombs, avoiding unnecessary combat and using the environment and her clerical powers strategically to reach a sacred tomb at the center. Inside the sacred tomb is a glowing book, which can be discovered with a DC 12 Perception/Investigation check. She may use Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid detection by the undead (DC 15), Wisdom (Perception) checks to find and utilize natural cover or hidden pathways (DC 13), or use Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave or Turn Undead strategically to clear safe paths without engaging in direct combat.
	* Start this by rolling initiative. On each monster's turn, it rolls a Perception check, compared to Thana's Stealth (passive Stealth if not rolled). On a success, the monster moves toward Thana at their full speed, and may attack if able. If at any time Thana is reduced to zero hit points, she wakes up in a sarcophagus, and a new Specter is added where her corpse fell.
		* `encounter: 1: Wraith, 2: Specter`
		* `encounter: 1: Will-o-wisp`
	* "Do not confront the shadows head-on, Thana. Use your surroundings. A single beam of light can pierce the deepest darkness if aimed true."
	* "Thana, do you remember the evenings we spent in the garden, trying to catch fireflies? The Will-o-wisps are much like them. Patience and observation were your best tools then, and they will serve you well now."
	* "Think back to when we played hide and seek among the old trees of Shae Mordai. You learned that finding the best hiding spots meant thinking several steps ahead, predicting where I would look. Use that same foresight now. Anticipate your enemies' moves and plan your actions wisely."
	* "Strength alone cannot fell darkness. Observe patterns, and weaknesses. A well-timed evasion can save you more surely than any shield."
	* "Thana, you've always had a strong heart, but it's your mind that sets you apart. Remember when you helped me tend to the sick, carefully choosing herbs to heal rather than just trying to soothe the pain? Strategy, not brute force, is what heals and protects. Carry that lesson with you, my dear."

* **Verity**.
	* **Guide**: Linaria, Verity's mother.
	* Verity must avoid a spectral angel who stands between her and a central pedestal which houses two artifacts. She may do this by using illusion magic to disguise herself, or another creative solution. The central pedestal is shielded in such a way that she has to use something like mage hand to grab the artifact she chooses.
	* Once an artifact is chosen, either of chaos or order, the room changes and presents a new unique challenge depending on the choice - but eventually leading to a glowing book.
	* "Do you remember the day you sought to save me? You faced a choice then, as you do now. Consider not just the immediate gain, but the ripples of your actions. True strategy lies in foresight and wisdom."

* **Staff**. Incorporate Library Automatons as a fun roleplaying challenge related to her past as a librarian?

##### 3: The Crystal Library

 - [ ]  **Draconic Sphere**

- The party re-converges in a central room housing a massive, magical globe showing draconic ley lines and power nexuses.
- The room features maps data stored within spellshards that can be used to update or manipulate the globe. Players may use the spellshards to piece together a strategic map for navigating dragon territories and eventually facing off with the dragons.

 - [ ]  **Repository of Knowledge**

- This is the true heart of the Crystal Library, an expansive chamber with racks upon racks of delicate spellshards, which contain any information about dragons that they could hope to know. Any Intelligence checks made to gather information about dragons gain a +2 bonus.

##### 4: The Chamber of Echoes

 - [ ]  **Confrontation**

- Reaching the heart of the library, they face the chief librarian — a transformed Repository that has absorbed too much forbidden knowledge and seeks to prevent anyone from reaching Argonnessen.
- The battle tests not just their combat prowess but their ability to use the environment to their advantage, manipulating the crystal structures to create reflections and illusions that confuse the Repository.

`encounter: 1: Repository, 4: Library Automaton`

 - [ ]  **Azalakardon's Vault**

- Contains scribbled notes and scrolls from Azalakardon, showing his descent into madness.
- Players must piece together Azalakardon’s research without succumbing to the madness themselves (Wisdom saves required).

##### 5: The Portal to Argonnessen

 - [ ]  **The Portal**

- With the Repository defeated, the true destination of the library reveals itself: a crystal portal that leads directly to Argonnessen. This portal, powered by the library's vast knowledge, requires them to contribute a piece of their own lore to activate.

 - [ ]  **Revelation**

As they step through the portal, they find themselves not just in another location but in a time slightly ahead of when they left, providing them with unexpected insights into their enemy's movements. They also realize the library has chosen them as its new guardians, linking their fates to its vast, magical network and setting up future adventures tied to the defense and exploration of its knowledge.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  It seems the attack on the Shalquar monastery by the topaz dragons was an attempt to destroy a little-known access to Argonnessen, through an ancient structure known as the The Crystal Library of Azalakardon. The monks had recently unearthed a tunnel connecting to it, and word must have gotten to the dragons somehow.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Monsters: Ink Devils (ToB1, CR 2), Wind Dragon, Young? (ToB1), Library Automaton (ToB1, CR 1/2), Paper Drake (ToB1, CR 2), Repository (ToB2)
* Theme: "Strategy beats strength every time"
* Possibly use that as a chance for players to gather secrets against the dragons? See what the secret mechanics from Vecna: Eve of Ruin are, and see if they're useful here.
	* A character can magically spend a secret like currency, revealing it to gain a momentary boon. To do this, the character must use an action to whisper the secret into the wind. The secret is then gone from the minds of every character in the party. When a character spends a secret, every character in the party gains advantage on d20 rolls for 1 minute.
* Separate the players at the mid-point and funnel them into their own challenges (see NADDPOD C3 Ep. 57: Cold Hard Truths) that fit their story and reflect the theme of the importance of strategy in the upcoming fight.
* "Eladrin-Giant-Dragon Chess" as one example:
	* https://kemono.su/patreon/user/11040805/post/102090591 (image shows player pieces moved inward one row)
	* Red = Dragons, Blue = Eladrin (Emily), Green = Giants (Murph)
	* Each player has four pieces, and each piece has 8 hp. On your turn, your pieces can move twice, or move and attack. You can attack another piece in an adjacent block. The giants do 1d8 damage. The eladrin do 1d6, but they have a special ability - they can jump over other pieces (fey step). The dragons are agents of chaos, they will automatically attack whatever piece(s) they are closest to - they do 1d10 damage and have 12 hp. Attacks automatically hit, it's just a matter of doing enough damage. You win when your opponent loses all of their pieces. The dragons do not have to be killed.
	* Board is composed of 2 cols x 12 rows, with player pieces starting on the far ends and the dragon pieces in the middle (two spaces between the player pieces and the dragon pieces). Losing a piece on the board causes the player to lose 1/4 of their HP.
* The blue dragon Azalakardon was a brilliant prophet and one of the most strident voices promoting the Chamber’s active role in directing the path of the Prophecy. Then something happened — some claim he received a prophetic vision that he couldn’t accept, and it broke him inside. He became paranoid and reclusive, and one day he simply disappeared. Divination has produced no results, but it’s well known that his private sanctum is shielded with epic-level magics. Many say that his sanctum includes thousands of spellshard journals — the greatest collection of information on the Prophecy ever assembled, including the secret that drove him mad. By now Azalakardon must be dead of old age, but his library has never been found. What traps guard this trove of knowledge?
