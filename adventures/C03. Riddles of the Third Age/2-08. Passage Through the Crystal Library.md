### Background and Hook(s)

* The Tapestry was conceived by a group of younger dragons 4,000 years ago, who wanted to bring dragons of different colors together to exchange new ideas about religion, the Draconic Prophecy, and philosophy. These dragons were ignored by older dragons, until they successfully predicted the emergence of dragonmarks among humanoids. The Conclave then provided the Tapestry of Thought as a territory for these younger dragons to experiment and continue their work. Eventually the Conclave allowed these dragons to act outside of Argonnessen, resulting in the formation of the Chamber.
* The blue dragon Azalakardon was one of the greatest students of the Prophecy, but he grew paranoid and reclusive. Tales say he unearthed knowledge that slowly drove him mad. Whatever the truth, Azalakardon is long gone. His library, said to be one of the greatest repositories of both arcane and Prophecy lore, lies hidden by epic magic, waiting to be rediscovered.
* The head of Aither's monastery, Kaelen, sends a letter asking her to return to the monastery to investigate strange happenings among the blue dragons of Adar.

### Characters and Locations

* **Vorel’arux, The Tapestry, [[Argonnessen]]**

### Scenes and Situations

##### 1: Hidden Entrance

 - [ ]  **Gaining Access**

- When the players arrive in Adar, the Unity Games are underway. Anyone at Aither's monastery (Kasshta Keep) would be aware of the strange happenings with the blue dragons, and assume the cause is powerful magic emanating from a nearby mountain. But unfortunately for the players, no one is allowed to access the former monastery, except those competing in the final event of the Unity Games, which takes place in the area. So the players will likely have to enter the games in order to get where they need to go.
- The Unity Games is composed of a bracket system of three rounds, with only the final two champions facing off in the final event. Contenders can choose their events, and those with the most number of points at the end of each round move on. Random NPCs compose any slots not taken up by players, and their points should be randomly determined by a roll of `dice:1d6+4` (or by rolls during the event if facing off against a PC).

 - [ ]  **The Monastic Tunnel**

- The newly unearthed tunnel by the monks of Shalquar monastery. Ancient, worn, and partially collapsed, signs of recent excavation are evident. Navigating through unstable sections requires careful movement or risk causing a collapse.

 - [ ]  **The Guardian**

- The players discover the hidden entrance of the Crystal Library near the former Shalquar monastery, likely accessed by participating in the Unity Games, but possibly by another means.
- An ancient guardian, a Young Wind Dragon, initially bars the way, protecting the ancient home of his ancestor.



##### 2: The Labyrinth of Lore

 - [ ]  **The Labyrinth**

- Inside, the library is a maze of corridors filled with books and populated with Ink Devils and Paper Drakes, mischievous creatures that rearrange the paths and rooms to confuse intruders. Interestingly, if any of the books are opened, they are totally blank. These books are actually decoys, and the entire chamber is trap to keep interlopers out of the true Crystal Library.

 - [ ]  **The Archives**

Aither and/or Staff recognizes some of the library's layout from her studies and leads the group to a secluded archive. Here, they must solve a puzzle involving ancient tomes that reveal the secret path to Argonnessen, while also learning valuable information about their final destination and the enemies they will face.

Split the party into their own challenges?

 - [ ]  **The Draconic Sphere**

- The party re-converges in a central room housing a massive, magical globe showing draconic ley lines and power nexuses.
- The room features maps data stored within spellshards that can be used to update or manipulate the globe. Players may use the spellshards to piece together a strategic map for navigating dragon territories and eventually facing off with the dragons.

##### 3: The Gale Halls

 - [ ]  **Wind's Whispers**

- As they navigate deeper, they encounter halls that become more crystalline and are guarded by a Wind Dragon, creating powerful gusts that threaten to push them back or separate them.

 - [ ]  **The Repository**

- This is the true heart of the Crystal Library, an expansive chamber with racks upon racks of delicate spellshards, which contain any information about dragons that they could hope to know. Any Intelligence checks made to gather information about dragons gain a +2 bonus.
- In these halls lies a Repository, a sentient library entity that offers knowledge in exchange for memories or secrets. Dealing with the Repository can provide shortcuts or aid in their journey but at a potentially steep price.

##### 4: The Chamber of Echoes

 - [ ]  **Confrontation**

Reaching the heart of the library, they face the chief librarian — a transformed Repository that has absorbed too much forbidden knowledge and seeks to prevent anyone from reaching Argonnessen.

 - [ ]  **Resolution**

The battle tests not just their combat prowess but their ability to use the environment to their advantage, manipulating the crystal structures to create reflections and illusions that confuse the Repository.

 - [ ]  **Azalakardon's Vault**

- Description: Contains scribbled notes and scrolls from Azalakardon, showing his descent into madness.
- Challenge: Players must piece together Azalakardon’s research without succumbing to the madness themselves (Wisdom saves required).

##### 5: The Portal to Argonnessen

 - [ ]  **The Portal**

With the Repository defeated, the true heart of the library reveals itself: a crystal portal that leads directly to Argonnessen. This portal, powered by the library's vast knowledge, requires them to contribute a piece of their own lore to activate.

 - [ ]  **Revelation**

As they step through the portal, they find themselves not just in another location but in a time slightly ahead of when they left, providing them with unexpected insights into their enemy's movements. They also realize the library has chosen them as its new guardians, linking their fates to its vast, magical network and setting up future adventures tied to the defense and exploration of its knowledge.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  It seems the attack on the Shalquar monastery by the topaz dragons was an attempt to destroy a little-known access to Argonnessen, through an ancient structure known as the The Crystal Library of Azalakardon. The monks had recently unearthed a tunnel connecting to it, and word must have gotten to the dragons somehow.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Monsters: Ink Devils (ToB1, CR 2), Wind Dragon, Young? (ToB1), Library Automaton (ToB1, CR 1/2), Paper Drake (ToB1, CR 2), Repository (ToB2)
* Theme: "Strategy beats strength every time"
* Possibly use that as a chance for players to gather secrets against the dragons? See what the secret mechanics from Vecna: Eve of Ruin are, and see if they're useful here.
* Separate the players at the mid-point and funnel them into their own challenges (see NADDPOD C3 Ep. 57: Cold Hard Truths) that fit their story and reflect the theme of the importance of strategy in the upcoming fight.
* "Eladrin-Giant-Dragon Chess" as one example:
	* https://kemono.su/patreon/user/11040805/post/102090591 (image shows player pieces moved inward one row)
	* Red = Dragons, Blue = Eladrin (Emily), Green = Giants (Murph)
	* Each player has four pieces, and each piece has 8 hp. On your turn, your pieces can move twice, or move and attack. You can attack another piece in an adjacent block. The giants do 1d8 damage. The eladrin do 1d6, but they have a special ability - they can jump over other pieces (fey step). The dragons are agents of chaos, they will automatically attack whatever piece(s) they are closest to - they do 1d10 damage and have 12 hp. Attacks automatically hit, it's just a matter of doing enough damage. You win when your opponent loses all of their pieces. The dragons do not have to be killed.
	* Board is composed of 2 cols x 12 rows, with player pieces starting on the far ends and the dragon pieces in the middle (two spaces between the player pieces and the dragon pieces). Losing a piece on the board causes the player to lose 1/4 of their HP.
* The blue dragon Azalakardon was a brilliant prophet and one of the most strident voices promoting the Chamber’s active role in directing the path of the Prophecy. Then something happened — some claim he received a prophetic vision that he couldn’t accept, and it broke him inside. He became paranoid and reclusive, and one day he simply disappeared. Divination has produced no results, but it’s well known that his private sanctum is shielded with epic-level magics. Many say that his sanctum includes thousands of spellshard journals — the greatest collection of information on the Prophecy ever assembled, including the secret that drove him mad. By now Azalakardon must be dead of old age, but his library has never been found. What traps guard this trove of knowledge?
