### Background and Hook(s)

* The players emerge from the Crystal Library of Azalakardon in Argonnessen, and must traverse the center of the continent in order to get to Arstyvrax and his topaz dragons.
* This is run as a point crawl, with five major points (scenes below) and several minor connections that mostly lead to random encounters. Maybe of these involve dragons finding out the players, who should be traipsing across the continent unaccompanied.

### Characters and Locations

* 

* **[[Vorel’arux]] (The Tapestry, [[Argonnessen]])**
* **[[Io'lokar]] (The Vast, [[Argonnessen]])**
* **The Tapestry**
* **The Vast**

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **[[Vorel’Arux]]**

* The players emerge from the Library into a long-forgotten storm sewer that runs under the city of Vorel'arux. Ironically, the long lost Crystal Library of Azalakardon was literally under the dragons' feet the whole time! As the last player emerges, the door to the library (a non-descript stone wall-like structure) closes on its own.
* The sewer snakes under the entire city, allowing the players to access all major locations. But it doesn't go outside of the city, and the players will need to navigate the perimeter wall in order to get outside. Players would also need to emerge from the sewer in order to interact with anything they can see from within the sewers (such as the scrying Fountain).

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Some challenge(s) here, when the PCs emerge from the Crystal Library at Vorel’arux in the Tapestry. A unique challenge in the Tapestry (where non-dragons would be mostly ignored or treated as pets or pests) as well as The Vast (where there are fewer dragons of more different types, and non-dragons are entirely ignored), as the players traverse Argonnessen to get to the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Use the Talons of Tiamat as a foil to the players while here, possibly secretly hunting them from the shadows.
* There should be some information given out here about the Light of Siberys and their existing work to protect the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Probably run these areas as a point crawl. Possible encounters (more in Dragons of Eberron, page 63):
	* A non-dragon of some sort running away from somewhere. He's fleeing from a dragon master, who was keeping him captive.
	* Someone should try to take their Orb of Dragonkind
	* A dragon who discovers them while traveling. They must explain themselves and why they're here, or get eaten.
