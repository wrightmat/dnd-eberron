### Background and Hook(s)

* The players emerge from the Crystal Library of Azalakardon in Argonnessen, and must traverse the center of the continent in order to get to Arstyvrax and his topaz dragons.
* This is run as a point crawl, with five major points (scenes below) and several minor connections that mostly lead to random encounters. Maybe of these involve dragons finding out the players, who should be traipsing across the continent unaccompanied.

### Characters and Locations

* **Valthyrian the Watchful** (male mercury dragon). Valthyrian is an imposing adult mercury dragon with scales that glint like polished metal in the sunlight. His eyes are a deep orange, and they flit around constantly keeping awareness of his surroundings. His wings are broad and powerful, and his sleek and serpentine body ends with a whip-like tail. Valthyrian is known for his vigilance and unwavering sense of duty.
* **Thyrlossia the Veiled** (female iron dragon). Thyrlossia is a graceful adult iron dragon with shimmering scales with silver highlights. Her eyes are a bright silver, almost reflective, and her presence exudes an imposing aura. Her wings are sleek and agile, allowing her to maneuver effortlessly through the skies. Thyrlossia is known for her calm demeanor and her strategic mind. She is a patient observer, preferring to analyze situations thoroughly before taking action. She is compassionate and empathetic, often taking time to understand the needs and concerns of the inhabitants of Vorel’Arux. However, she is also a fierce protector, unyielding when the city’s safety is at stake.
* **Anthissalara the Seer** (female blue dragon). Anthissalara is an imposing ancient blue dragon with scales that shimmer like sapphires. Her eyes are a striking electric blue, glowing with arcane power. Her horns curve elegantly back from her head, and her wings are adorned with intricate patterns that seem to shift and change with her movements. She has a regal bearing, and her presence commands respect and attention. Anthissalara is known for her sharp intellect and her keen insight into the Draconic Prophecy. She is highly analytical and strategic, often seeing patterns and connections that others miss. Despite her formidable power, she prefers to operate from the shadows, using her abilities to observe and manipulate events from afar. She values knowledge and information above all else and is often more interested in the big picture than in individual details.
* **Skribble** (male kobold scholar). A small, wiry kobold with reddish-brown scales and bright, curious eyes. He wears a set of well-worn but meticulously maintained robes adorned with pockets and pouches filled with quills, scrolls, and small magical trinkets. His tail is often seen twitching with excitement, especially when discussing subjects of knowledge and lore. Despite his small stature, he has a commanding presence in the Archives due to his vast knowledge and quick wit.

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  **[[Vorel’Arux]]**

* The players emerge from the Library into a long-forgotten storm sewer that runs under the city of Vorel'arux. Ironically, the long lost Crystal Library of Azalakardon was literally under the dragons' feet the whole time! As the last player emerges, the door to the library (a non-descript stone wall-like structure) closes on its own.
* The sewer snakes under the entire city, allowing the players to access all major locations. But it doesn't go outside of the city, and the players will need to navigate the perimeter wall in order to get outside on their own. Players would also need to emerge from the sewer in order to interact with anything they can see from within the sewers (such as the below locations where interesting things are happening, or any of the other locations listed in the location page):
	* **The Fountain**. An Ancient Blue Dragon, Anthissalara the Seer, is scrying on other dragons across Argonnessen using the waters of The Fountain. It should be clear to the players that any location in Argonnessen can be seen from this pool of water. They can also observe from a distance that something is going on at the Pit of Five Sorrows, where topaz dragons can be seen gathering.
	* **Archives**. The sewers end abruptly at a wall similar to the one the party emerged from when leaving the Library. Those observing the wall see a kobold open it up, look around, and return inside. This same event occurs every hour, and the players may interact with the kobold (Skribble) if they choose, even possibly convincing him to let them inside. In that case, he might agree to help the players gather any information they may need. For every hour spent in the Archives, roll a d20 to determine if the patrol dragons check in - with them appearing on a 18+ (and this number decreasing by one for every additional hour spend in the Archives).
* Two dragons patrol the city - Valthyrian the Watchful and Thyrlossia the Veiled. Any time the players exit the sewers, they must roll a group Stealth check against the dragons' Passive Perception scores (22 and 20, respectively). If discovered, the patrolling dragons will warn the players only once, telling them to leave the city immediately. If discovered a second time, the party will be picked up by the dragons and flown out of the city, then dropped just outside of the wall (taking 7d6 bludgeoning damage from the 70 foot fall).

 - [ ]  **Gix'kuhri**

* This river divides Vorel'Arux from The Tapestry, and serves as a barrier for the players. At its narrowest, near Vorel'Arux, the river is several miles across. The players may choose to create a boat of some sort, use magic creatively, or simply try to traverse on foot.
* The players must each make a Strength check (DC 15) to attempt to cross the waters safely on foot. This check is made with disadvantage if the character is unable to stand in the water or has just been thrown into it. If a character fails this check, it is immediately pulled a number of feet downstream equal to the check's DC. If it collides with a rock or other hard object, the character takes (DC-10)d6 bludgeoning damage (minimum of 1d6). The character makes this check again at the start of each of its turns, getting pulled further downstream each time it fails.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Some challenge(s) here, when the PCs emerge from the Crystal Library at Vorel’arux in the Tapestry. A unique challenge in the Tapestry (where non-dragons would be mostly ignored or treated as pets or pests) as well as The Vast (where there are fewer dragons of more different types, and non-dragons are entirely ignored), as the players traverse Argonnessen to get to the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Use the Talons of Tiamat as a foil to the players while here, possibly secretly hunting them from the shadows.
* There should be some information given out here about the Light of Siberys and their existing work to protect the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Probably run these areas as a point crawl. Possible encounters (more in Dragons of Eberron, page 63):
	* A non-dragon of some sort running away from somewhere. He's fleeing from a dragon master, who was keeping him captive.
	* Someone should try to take their Orb of Dragonkind
	* A dragon who discovers them while traveling. They must explain themselves and why they're here, or get eaten.
