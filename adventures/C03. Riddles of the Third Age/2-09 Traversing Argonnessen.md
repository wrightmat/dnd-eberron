### DM Notes and Random Tables

* Some challenge(s) here, when the PCs emerge from the Crystal Library at Vorel’arux in the Tapestry. A unique challenge in the Tapestry (where non-dragons would be mostly ignored or treated as pets or pests) as well as The Vast (where there are fewer dragons of more different types, and non-dragons are entirely ignored), as the players traverse Argonnessen to get to the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* There should be some information given out here about the Light of Siberys and their existing work to protect the Pit of Five Sorrows.
* Probably run these areas as a point crawl. Possible encounters (more in Dragons of Eberron, page 63):
	* A non-dragon of some sort running away from somewhere. He's fleeing from a dragon master, who was keeping him captive.
	* Someone should try to take their Orb of Dragonkind
	* A dragon who discovers them while traveling. They must explain themselves and why they're here, or get eaten.
