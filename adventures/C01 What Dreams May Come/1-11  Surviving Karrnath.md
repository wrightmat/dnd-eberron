 #adventure #completed [[Karrnath]]

### Background and Hook(s)

Options to get in to Karrnath:

- By water, there aren’t any port towns or anything, but the party could manage to drop anchor on the coast near the Karrn Bay.
    - Would need to traverse the Icewood, and then search out Lakeside.
- By airship, Rekkenmark and Korth have confirmed docks (but Karrlakton and Atur could as well).
    - Would need to travel across Karrnath to the Icetop Mountains, and then search out Lakeside.
- There’s no option to get there via lightning rail unless the players are somehow able to coordinate rebuilding of the conductor stones connecting Thaliost and Rekkenmark (or the stones that the Tarnished Templar was laying that would go between Flamekeep and Tanar Rath).
- The only option via road is from Vathirond, and through the Mournland. This would be by far the most dangerous option.

Once there, if the players travel east of the Ashen Spires (anything past the major cities), use the table below for random encounters during travel. Any encounter with a hostile attitude immediately attacks the party.

| Attitude Roll | Initial Attitude |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| 4 or lower    | Hostile          |
| 5-8           | Indifferent      |
| 9 or higher   | Friendly         |

| d100 | Encounter | Attitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-15 | Two soldiers ride up, asking for identification papers (see The Royal Swords) |  |
| 16-20 | The partially eaten carcass of a mammoth, from which 1d4 weeks of rations can be harvested |  |
| 20-25 | A blizzard that reduces visibility to 5 feet for 1d6 hours |  |
| 26-32 | 1d4 + 3 trappers passing by (use the Scout stat block) | 2d6 + 3 |
| 33-40 | 1 polar bear | 1d12 |

**The Royal Swords**

No hazards or poor roads exist to hamper travel throughout Karrnath. There are, however, the Karrnath Royal Swords. This internal national guard patrols the roads and borders of the kingdom, and woe to the traveler whose identification papers aren't in order or who angers or annoys the Royal Swords in any way. They are quick to arrest or perform corporal or capital punishment in the name of the crown (the nation is still under martial law, after all), and they suffer no backtalk or aggravation from those they stop to question along the roads.

If the players obtained counterfeit papers from somewhere, like from the Midwife in Korth, they can get by the soldiers with a DC 10 Deception check (or they discover that the papers are counterfeit). If the players don’t have papers, or the papers are discovered as counterfeit, then the Captain of the Swords offers them a way out of the “delicate situation” they find themselves in. Some sort of cultists have been gathering in Lakeside for some unknown purpose; she wants the heroes to find out what the cultists are up to and either stop them (if the threat is imminent) or return with news of their plans. If the adventurers refuse, the captain promises to send them to Fort Zombie, where the Captain of Corpses can always use a few more recruits.
