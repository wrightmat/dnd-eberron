### Player-Facing Information



### Introduction and Session Zero

Each player should create a character that has a unique tie to magic. Encourage players to use concepts they may not have had a chance to up to this point - like dragonmarks, or magic specific to Eberron.

Go over the Strixhaven-specific mechanics, including relationships and exams.

### DM Notes

* Main concept is the nature of [[Magic]], and its power in the world, using Buddhist/Jainist ideals.
* Use the [[Path of Light]] as the primary organization to drive the story. Turns out their views of magic have been right all along!
* Malakar has the goal to essentially collect all the Mana for himself, turning himself into a god (the first true god of Eberron, higher than the Sovereigns). He's using forbidden blood magic to further his goal, and the Strixhaven Snarl as a conduit to channel the mana. The dragons despise blood magic (especially since it uses dragon blood), and its use was the reason why they destroyed the giants of Xen'drik (who were beginning to practice blood magic).

#### Act One

* Start out in Strixhaven, which is located in The Vast in Argonnessen, and has been teaching dragons and exceptional non-dragons in secrets for a long time. Each player should have some significant tie to magic - so discourage full martial classes like fighters and barbarians, but if used then the PC should think about where their power comes from, and how they want to grow their power as part of their character arc.
	* Could be fun to have different lectures that outline how each of the classes manipulate Mana to create magical effects.
* At Strixhaven, give each PC/Student a real planner/calendar, with all of the major school events, weekly class schedules, Eberron holidays, interesting facts, etc.
* Fang Crater: Use "Trail of Destruction" from Tales from the Radiant Citadel. This setting would probably be most worth exploring if a player belongs to Lorehold, or could be used as a Practicum for an archeology/volcanology class.

* The assault on Strixhaven became the perfect misdirection for Malakar's true goals. During the ensuing chaos, he entered the Biblioplex and descended into the Hall of Oracles to harness the power of the Strixhaven Snarl, a maelstrom of power left behind from the creation of the world. The party likely tries to intervene (or if not then one of the professors can), but are transported away the instant they get close to the Snarl. They land somewhere in Khorvaire, accompanied by a professor (and/or other NPCs) who was trying to help, and who can direct them to the other magical schools of Eberron so they can learn more about the nature of magic and how to take on the BBEG.

#### Act Two

* None of the PCs can use any magical spells, until they investigate and address that school of magic (in the appropriate adventure, as outlined below).
* As the story progresses, evidence of magic drain across Eberron should become apparent. As a wide magic world, this may be subtle at first, but maybe basic spells like *[[prestidigitation]]*, that's used everywhere for lots of things, stop working.
* Should try to do some sort of progression based on the different schools of magic (sort of like previously done with the skills), probably in Act 2. This should tie in various magical masters and schools across Eberron. Basically the BBEG has been trying to wipe out the different schools of magic by eliminating any master of that school (usually by going back in time and eliminating them from the timeline), or disrupting the education of it through the major academic organization. But expand this a bit to include additional magic to get to a "Baker's Dozen" - the eight standard 5e schools, plus psionics and artifice for Eberron, and the three for the BBEG and his lieutenants (chronomancy, dunamancy, and blood magic - which is the "minus one" in the Baker's Dozen).
	* Heavy use of Living Spells as monsters in each of the "magic type" inspired areas.
	* Possibly have the hooks related to tracking down other NPCs (preferably friends, related to each school) from Strixhaven who have also gone missing?
	* Blackroot (Droaam) - Transmutation
		* Mordain the Fleshweaver
		* Still navigate the Forest of Flesh, but they get to where the Tower is supposed to be, it's not there and is instead replaced by a menhir with a spell carved on it. If read aloud, it teleports the PCs back in time to 797 YK, when Mordain was excoriated from House Phiarlan. The adventure is to play out the events that took place, while stopping the BBEG from interfering (but need to figure out how to make it interesting, and still have player agency).
		* Temporal Beasts: Facing mutated creatures from different timelines.
		* Alchemical Hazards: Navigating through dangerous transmuted environments.
		* Transformation Puzzles: Solving puzzles that require changing the forms of objects or themselves.
	* Korranberg and Pylas Pyrial (Zilargo) - Illusion
		* Adapt Candlekeep, as needed, for Korranberg itself.
		* Pylas Pyrial should be the location they need to find, and the "dungeon" for this magic school. Possibly something to do with the Prince of Frost? Incorporate Ihan de Rhaan from C01.
		* https://www.worldanvil.com/w/eberjon-clarkjo03/a/pylas-pyrial-settlement
		* Temporal Illusions: Distinguishing between real and time-shifted illusions.
		* False Realities: Navigating through altered historical events.
	* Morgrave (Breland) - Abjuration
		* Protective Barriers: Navigating through layers of magical barriers within the sanctum.
		* Guardian Constructs: Battling constructs enhanced with abjuration spells like Shield and Warding Bond.
		* Counterspell Duels: Engaging in duels where counterspells and dispels are crucial to victory.
	* Rekkenmark (Karrnath) - Evocation
		* ???
	* Atur (Karrnath) - Necromancy
		* Almost certainly something to do with Kaius III, and the reveal that he's a vampire. Or maybe that was stopped somehow, and the current version isn't a vampire?
		* Temporal Undead: Battling undead that phase in and out of time.
		* Death Traps: Navigating through crypts filled with necromantic traps and curses.
	* University of Wynarn (Aundair) - Enchantment
		* Mind-Controlled Agents: Battling charmed figures from different timelines.
		* Disenchantment Ritual: Performing a ritual to break charms without affecting the timeline.
		* Persuasion Duels: Engaging in social challenges to outwit and break enchantments.
	* Arcanix (Aundair) - Divination
		* The BBEG has used a powerful spell to corrupt the Eye of Siberys, causing it to generate false and misleading prophecies, thereby disrupting divination practices across Eberron.
		* The players travel back to the moment when the BBEG corrupted the Eye of Siberys and prevent the disruption.
		* Detective Work: Using spells like Detect Magic, Detect Good and Evil, and Detect Poison and Disease to uncover hidden dangers and clues left by the BBEG.
		* Corrupted Prophecies: Interpreting and rectifying corrupted prophecies that the Eye now produces, which lead the players into traps or false leads.
		* Astral Projections: Entering the Astral Plane to retrieve a lost prophecy fragment hidden by the BBEG.
		* Time Scrying: Using scrying spells to locate the BBEG and track his movements through different points in time.
	* Greenheart (Eldeen Reaches) - Conjuration
		* Oalian, the ancient awakened oak druid. Is maybe corrupted, and the dungeon is Great Deku Tree style? Or is missing entirely and they go back in time.
		* Summoned Creatures: Battling creatures conjured by the BBEG to guard the corruption.
		* Ritual of Restoration: Performing a complex ritual to heal or restore Oalian.
	* Mournland? - Artifice
		* Lord of Blades?
		* Restore tool proficiencies rather than a spell school?
	* Adar (Sarlona) - Psionics
		* Mind Battles: Engaging in psionic duels within the mindscape.

#### Act Three

- Strixhaven - Wild Magic, Dunamancy (Chronurgy, Graviturgy), and Hemomancy (dragon blood magic in Eberron, which Malakar practices). So maybe a couple of lieutenants that the PCs have to take on before the BBEG?
	* Wild Magic - maybe include a short planar jaunt through manifest zones spread around northern Argonnessen, as the players hunt down the BBEG's second lieutenant? Definitely use the Wild Mange as an enemy.
	* Dunamancy - this is the BBEG's first lieutenant, who has been corrupting time and wiping out schools of magic. Maybe some final time-hopping adventure, where we can visit various times/locations such as the Last War and other important events.
	* Hemomancy - final BBEG battle.
