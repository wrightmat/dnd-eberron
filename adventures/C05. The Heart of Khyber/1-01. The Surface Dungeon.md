### Background and Hook(s)

* The beginning of the campaign will focus on the cave dungeon that the PCs initially inhabit. They will believe that this is the full extent of the campaign, with time spend performing jobs such as lighting torches and training minions. The primarily goal is to protect the treasure they have collected from invading heroes.

### Characters and Locations

* **Gulp, the Gelatinous** (sentient gelatinous cube quartermaster). Gulp is a _remarkably_ intelligent gelatinous cube that somehow developed sentience (and a quirky personality) after absorbing an ancient artifact in the deepest recesses of the dungeon centuries ago. Instead of devouring adventurers like his non-sentient cousins, Gulp took an interest in dungeon management, finding satisfaction in the meticulous organization and deployment of traps, supplies, and creature comforts. He takes his role as the dungeon quartermaster very seriously and _adores_ the PCs as if they were his favorite coworkers. Though he can only communicate telepathically (no vocal cords, after all), his "voice" is surprisingly cheerful, upbeat, and filled with a unique brand of wobbly optimism. His gelatinous nature means he constantly shifts between bubbly excitement and quivering nervousness. Gulp is a shimmering, semi-transparent cube of goo, about 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall, with various dungeon supplies suspended within him. You might see torches, bear traps, a toolbox, or a random coil of rope slowly floating inside his body as he shifts about the dungeon. Those needing supplies simple reach in and take them, hoping their arms don't burn off in the process.
* **Zurk, the Friendly Mimic** (mimic, usually disguised as a treasure chest). Surprisingly chatty and sociable, Zurk is a mimic who refuses to attack anyone. Instead of ambushing adventurers, he wants to befriend them. He loves hearing stories about treasure and heroes but doesn’t want to harm them — he just wants to hang out. His dream is to one day leave the dungeon and open up a "non-lethal" mimic-themed restaurant where the furniture is made up of his mimic cousins (who are also pacifists). Zurk is always accidentally terrifying, forgetting that his "natural form" as a giant maw filled with teeth is horrifying to others. He tries his best to put people at ease, but when he morphs into a chest with a creepy tongue sticking out, it’s less than charming.
- **Marga, the Meddling Medusa** (female medusa). Marga is a motherly figure who takes an active interest in everyone’s personal affairs, to the point of being nosy. Instead of petrifying adventurers, she prefers to give them unsolicited life advice. She’s a matchmaker, self-proclaimed life coach, and loves meddling in the relationships of dungeon inhabitants. She spends most of her time decorating the dungeon with plants (that her snake hair tends to accidentally eat). Marga’s attempts to offer advice are often hilariously off-base, and she frequently uses her petrifying gaze to "freeze" people in awkward situations so she can better lecture them on their life choices ("There, dear, now you can't run off while I'm talking to you."). Thankfully, she knows how to reverse the effect.
- **Snivel, the "Dungeon Supervisor"** (male goblin). Snivel is a small, cowardly goblin who somehow believes he’s the "Dungeon Supervisor," even though no one appointed him to the position. He’s constantly trying to manage the other creatures of the dungeon, bossing around monsters much larger and scarier than he is, though they rarely listen. Snivel loves bureaucracy, frequently stopping by to check up on the PCs and ensure they’re "on schedule" with their torch-lighting and trap-setting duties. Despite his delusions of grandeur, Snivel is incredibly skittish and will flee at the first sign of danger. He’s fond of carrying around a clipboard and attempting to give "performance reviews" to dungeon creatures — though no one cares. He also has an obsession with charts and graphs, believing they can solve all problems. His presence is both annoying and oddly charming, as he’s terrible at his self-proclaimed job but tries so hard.
- **Vesper, the Pensive Vampire Spawn** (female vampire spawn). Vesper is a vampire spawn who is going through an existential crisis. Instead of reveling in her vampiric nature, she feels deeply conflicted about it, constantly pondering the morality of feeding on others and whether her existence is inherently evil. She reads a lot of self-help books and is prone to long, melancholic speeches about the burden of immortality. She’s more of a sulky goth than a traditional terrifying vampire. Vesper drinks "vegan blood alternatives" (bloodroot juice, synthetic blood concoctions) to avoid feeding on sentient beings, though she secretly despises them. She’s often found dramatically sighing or staring out of dungeon windows (if there are any), contemplating the meaning of eternity.
- **Grothok, "The Bickering Bugbear"** (male bugbear). Grothok is a brutish bugbear who absolutely loves to fight — but the problem is, he has a big mouth and is constantly arguing with his own weapons. He believes each weapon has a distinct personality, and he holds long, heated debates with them about strategy, timing, and who gets the "kill shot." His favorite weapon, a massive spiked club named "Clobber," is his most trusted companion, but even Clobber "talks back" in Grothok's head. Grothok’s tendency to argue with his weapons often gets in the way of actually fighting. He might be in the middle of a battle with intruders, only to stop and berate Clobber for not being heavy enough to crush someone properly. "Come on, Clobber, you call that a hit? I’ve seen toothpicks do more damage! Step it up!"
- **Ulgax, the Fire-Breathing Kobold** (male kobold). Ulgax has an unhealthy obsession with dragons and has done everything in his power to make himself more "dragon-like," despite only being a kobold. He’s managed to learn a rudimentary form of fire-breathing (which is more of a smoky cough than a proper flame) and insists on being treated as "Ulgax the Mighty Dragon." Ulgax is constantly trying to prove himself and believes he’s destined for greatness, even though he’s comically weak compared to real dragons. Despite his small size and limited power, Ulgax is overly dramatic and has a flair for theatrical entrances. He demands that people acknowledge his "draconic majesty" and will breathe a pathetic puff of smoke at anyone who disagrees. He also wears an oversized dragon-skin cloak, which only emphasizes how tiny he is. Ulgax can be found in the deeper parts of the dungeon, setting small, fire-themed traps or trying to prove his "dragonhood" by roasting small critters. He’ll attack anyone who mocks him or refuses to acknowledge his draconic status, but his attacks are more flashy than effective.
- **Xarlash, the Sadistic** (male nothic). Xarlash is a twisted and sadistic creature who loves torturing adventurers with psychic torment. He revels in their pain and is constantly probing their minds to dig up their darkest secrets and insecurities, which he then taunts them with. He’s gleeful about making others suffer and has a deeply unsettling giggle that echoes through the dungeon corridors. Xarlash likes to play psychological games with his victims before attacking, planting seeds of doubt and paranoia in their minds by revealing hidden thoughts or embarrassing memories. "Oh, I see someone’s afraid of the dark. How interesting. Does it remind you of that time you got lost as a child? Oh yes, I know all about that."
- **Kragath, the Gnoll "Tactician"** (male gnoll). Kragath is a gnoll who fancies himself a military genius, though his idea of "strategy" is simply "charge and kill everything." He loves battle and relishes the chaos, but he’s always trying to describe his actions in flowery terms, using military jargon he barely understands. He believes he’s leading a well-disciplined army, when in reality, his band of gnolls is just as wild and bloodthirsty as he is. Kragath constantly shouts "tactical commands" that make no sense in the heat of battle, like "Form the flanking wedge! Execute the pincer move!" — even though his gnolls just charge blindly. If things go wrong, he’ll blame his underlings rather than his own lack of planning, and if he’s winning, he’ll brag about his "brilliant strategies" endlessly.
- **Thrastrix, the Beholderkin** (non-binary spectator). Thrastrix is a Spectator, a lesser beholder who is just as arrogant as their larger cousins. They're obsessed with "maintaining order" in the dungeon and sees themself as the ultimate overseer. Thrastrix is a control freak who wants everything to be just so, and they lashes out at anyone who disrupts the "balance" of their domain — whether it’s adventurers causing chaos or a trap malfunctioning. Thrastrix believes they are destined to become a full-fledged beholder, so is constantly giving grandiose speeches about their future power and control.

* **The Great Hall** (Entrance and Gathering Area). A grand chamber with high ceilings and flickering torches, lined with crumbling stone statues of previous dungeon bosses. This is the main entry point for heroes foolish enough to invade, often featuring traps and defenses to slow down attackers. Long, dark banners hang from the ceiling, emblazoned with the symbol of the dungeon master.
	* 1/6 chance that Grothok the Bugbear patrols the Great Hall, ready to "welcome" any intruders with his constant weapon-bickering.
	* 2/6 chance that Snivel the Goblin Dungeon Supervisor is found near the entrance, clipboard in hand, scurrying about to "ensure everything is in working order" (though it usually isn’t).
* **Morgra’s Kitchen** (The Hag’s Hearth). A large, filthy kitchen filled with bubbling cauldrons, strange glowing herbs, and an oven that radiates unsettling heat. Shelves are lined with jars of pickled adventurer parts and mystical ingredients. A crude dining table in the center features a variety of strange utensils, and Morgra the Hag can be heard humming eerie lullabies as she stirs her stews.
	* 5/6 chance that Morgra the Hungry Hag is found in her kitchen, experimenting with her latest "recipe" or preparing the next unfortunate hero for a hearty stew.
	* 2/6 chance that Ulgax the Kobold has dropped by to share his culinary "dragon wisdom," though Morgra finds him irritating.
* **Torture Chamber** (Xarlash’s Lair). A dark, cold room with iron chains dangling from the ceiling, broken weapons and bones scattered across the floor, and a faint, eerie glow from the runes inscribed on the walls. The torture implements are rusty and aged, but the psychological terror of the place is far more horrifying than the physical.
	* Xarlash the Nothic is always here, tormenting prisoners or intruders with his twisted psychic games. The room’s atmosphere is thick with paranoia and dread, and he delights in teasing the PCs with unsettling insights into their thoughts and fears.
* **The Treasure Vault**. A cavernous room filled with piles of ill-gotten treasure — coins, gems, and magical artifacts. Much of the treasure is cursed or rigged with traps, making it perilous to touch. The air smells faintly of sulfur, and the room is lit by a dim, magical glow from enchanted jewels embedded in the walls.
	* 4/6 chance that Ulgax the Fire-Breathing Kobold guards this vault, convinced that the treasure is his personal dragon hoard. He struts around, trying to look menacing and occasionally "breathing fire" (though it’s mostly smoke). He attacks anyone who threatens his "dragon wealth" but can be flattered into letting players get away with small bits.
	* 2/6 chance that Zurk the Friendly Mimic is pretending to be a treasure chest here, "guarding" the treasure and waiting for someone to chat with him.
* **The Armory**. A cluttered, dimly-lit room filled with racks of rusted weapons, half-finished traps, and piles of old dungeon supplies. Blueprints for complex traps are scattered around, though most of them are poorly drawn or incomplete. A workbench sits in the middle of the room, with tools and parts scattered about haphazardly.
	* 4/6 chance that Grothok the Bugbear is here, sharpening or polishing his weapons while arguing with them.
* The Blood Pits (Gnoll Barracks). A grimy, battle-scarred room filled with crude gnoll-made bedding and weapon racks. The walls are scratched with crude battle drawings, and the floor is sticky with old blood. The smell of wet fur and decay fills the air, and the constant sound of gnoll cackling echoes off the walls.
	* Kragath the Gnoll Tactician always commands his pack from here, barking orders and preparing for raids. His underlings are rowdy and chaotic, but Kragath insists they’re the most "elite fighting force" in the dungeon, despite their complete lack of discipline. They’ll readily attack intruders, with Kragath loudly proclaiming his “genius strategies” in between swings.
