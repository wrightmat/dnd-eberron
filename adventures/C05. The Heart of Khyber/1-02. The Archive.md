### Scenes and Situations

#### Auditorium

- A LARGE ROOM EMPTY OF BOOKSHELVES, SEMI-CIRCULAR IN SHAPE. In the middle of the flat side, there is a small stage with a desk and behind it a large blackboard. Around this in half-circles are rings of benches, each row a few feet higher than the one in front.

#### Boiler Room

- A ROOM DEVOID OF BOOKSHELVES. Against one wall, a huge black-iron furnace, over which a tank of water boils. Large pipes channel the steam elsewhere in the Library.
	- If the boiler itself is broken (which will take some skilled sabotage, or 20 damage in one go), it ruptures and bursts, dealing 4D6 damage to all in the room.
	- Steam vents on the front of the boiler or the pipes that snake away from it can be damaged or released: the blast of steam that issues deals D6 damage. Save vs Dragon Breath for half damage. Damage to the steam pipes has a similar result.

#### Calculation Engine

- THE SHELVES GIVE WAY TO A HUGE MACHINE MADE OF CLOCKWORK AND STEAM PUMPS. Incredibly complex, the machine hisses, creaks, clicks, and turns.
	- There is a terminal in the front-centre of the Calculation Engine. Tiles that can be pushed, marked with letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, and punctuation. Above the tiles, there is a slot from which emerges a long ribbon of paper that winds down into a pile on the floor, like ticker-tape. A mechanical pen writes onto the paper ribbon as it’s extruded.

> [!info] Calculation Engine
> It is, effectively, a mechanical computer, using gears and valves rather than electrical components. It is only one part of a much greater whole that lies in a huge network spread throughout the library.

- Pushing a tile results in a series of clicks, and new wheels within the machine starting to turn. You can type things into the engine using these tiles.
	- Anything the players type in is put into the Calculation Engine. The output will be written on the paper ribbon, extruded out into the pile. The players can read the response, which will vary depending on what input they used.
	- If the players input a fact that is known to be true (which is to say, correctly recorded as factual in any book anywhere in the world), the response is: "Data Confirmed"
	- If the players input a fact that is known to be false (which is to say, correctly refuted in any book anywhere in the world), the response is: "Data Contradictory"
	- If the players input a question that has an answer in any book anywhere in the world, the machine responds by naming the closest book which contains an answer.
		- They get +1 Progress if the question asked is related to the information they are looking for.
		- This +1 Progress applies for each related question they ask, each getting the response of a new book, until they have a list of 6 books (a total of +6 Progress). After this, the Calculation Engine begins to repeat the same books.
	- If the players input a question to which no answer is recorded in any book anywhere in the world, the response is: "Data Not Found".
	- If the players input anything which is neither a stated fact nor a question, the response is: "Unknown Input. RECALIBRATING"
- The Calculation Engine is attended to by `dice:1d4` Grey Order Librarians at all times. If they are slain or removed, more will arrive within a turn.

#### Catalogue of Contents

- CHAINED ONTO A LECTERN, A SINGLE HUGE CATALOGUE WITH PAGES THE SIZE OF A HUMAN TORSO, BOUND IN BLACK LEATHER. The catalogue lists what books are stored nearby, and where. The instructions and directions given are confusing to follow; the PCs can get a picture of what’s nearby but actually tracking things down will be difficult.
- Consulting it for a turn allows one of the following benefits:
	- Increase the party’s Progress Score by 5. This benefit can be gained only once for each piece of information sought.
	- Roll a random Extraordinary Book. The next time the party discovers an Extraordinary Book, this will be with it. Subsequent rolls determine the book after that, and so on. Once the party rolls the same Extraordinary Book a second time, that is all that can be found.

CHAINED LECTERN

- AN ORNATE LECTERN, RAISED ON A SLIGHT PLATFORM. On it, open, is a large book. Each corner of the book’s cover is fastened to the lectern, and the lectern is bolted to the floor. When nobody is observing it, it gives a soft creak or gentle rattle, as if straining against restraints.
- Roll on the Extraordinary Books Table for what the book on the lectern is. This version, however, is dangerous. Reading it results in paper-cuts as the pages twist awkwardly beneath your fingers, dealing 1 damage for each turn spent reading.
- If two corners of the book are unfastened (perhaps in order to remove it), the book animates and rips itself free of its bindings.
