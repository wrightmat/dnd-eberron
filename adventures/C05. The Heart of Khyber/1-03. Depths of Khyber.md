### DM Notes and Random Tables

- For the previous The Archive adventure, the players likely start at Level 3 and advance to somewhere in the Tier 2 (Levels 5-10) range by the end, depending on how much they explore and how many encounters they have. For the Khyber adventures, it's probably best for them to be as close to Level 10 as possible to make for interesting challenges. This campaign is likely to end at/before Level 15.
