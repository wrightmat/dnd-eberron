### Background and Hook(s)

* The Depths of Khyber are large and varied. This adventure is designed to outline the basic structure that will be used for all Khyber adventures, the specifics of which are covered in the next several adventures. Random tables below can be used to structure the adventures between the three different "levels" of Khyber - the Shadow Demiplanes, the Prison Demiplanes, and the Heart Demiplanes.
* The demiplanes of Khyber are somewhat like the layers of other planes. Each demiplane has limited space, though it could be as small as a house or as large as a nation. Its borders might be defined by impassable physical barriers or walls of force, or the pocket of space could wrap around — if you walk far enough in one direction, you’ll find you’ve looped back to where you began.

### Characters and Locations

* **Tzocar, the Whispering Skull** (LE male demilich). Once an ancient and powerful necromancer, Tzocar transcended mortality, achieving demilichdom after centuries of study and dark rituals. His goal was to unravel the secrets of death itself, a pursuit that rendered him something between an oracle and a tyrant. Tzocar is a master of manipulation, possessing a dry and cutting wit, a keen intelligence, and an endless well of condescension for those who serve him. His tone is typically mocking, as if he’s speaking to children who can barely grasp the vast truths he has uncovered. However, he is quick to turn to threats if he feels his authority is being questioned. Tzocar prides himself on being the ultimate architect of the dungeon, believing his intelligence and knowledge are the foundation upon which all others must stand.

* **Heart Demiplanes**. 
* **Prison Demiplanes**. 
* **Shadow Demiplanes**.

### DM Notes and Random Tables

- For the previous The Archive adventure, the players likely start at Level 3 and advance to somewhere in the Tier 2 (Levels 5-10) range by the end, depending on how much they explore and how many encounters they have. For the Khyber adventures, it's probably best for them to be as close to Level 10 as possible to make for interesting challenges. This campaign is likely to end at/before Level 15.
