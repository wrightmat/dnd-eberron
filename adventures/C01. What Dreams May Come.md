### Outline

#### Chapter 1: Arend the Alchemist

* The adventures of Chapter 1 revolve around the players' backstories and exploring the various areas of Eberron, and serves as an introductory chapter.
* After meeting in Delethorn, the group bands together to address an issue that's been brought to their attention by the mayor. Investigating a newly opened factory leads them to discover undead workers that are shipping food out to somewhere. Eventually, a found map leads to more locations across the continent, and experienced dreams give more visceral details.
* Each player is tied to a marker on the map, which related to their story in some way and houses a bad guy that's designed to be a foil to their class.
* After finding and addressing the problems at the "Flame" (Onme), "Water" (Windsor), "Triangles" (Bystan), and "Runestone" (Astra) markers, the party's attention is drawn to one final marker on the map - a crown over the country of Karrnath.
* Arriving in Karrnath, after a brief distraction in the Madwood where they met a new warforged friend, the group entered the alchemy shop that seemed to be the only building of interest. Inside they eventually met a maddened scientist with a strange dragonmark, who they managed to take out. They learned from the materials around his lab that he had apparently sent all the "bad guys" they had already taken care of to rather materials and people to rebuild his war-torn country.

#### Chapter 2: The Shardjammer

* The adventures of Chapter 2 revolve around The Mournland and the building of Eberron's first spelljamming (shardjamming) ship.
* After a brief murder mystery aboard the Orien Express, the group landed in Gatherhold and made their way into The Mournland.
* Months of traveling The Mournland, hex crawl style, eventually led them to Making where they discovered a secret underground laboratory that used to belong to House Cannith. Inside where the plans for a prototype they were working on - designed to generate sufficient thrust to leave Eberron's atmosphere (but which overloaded and caused the devastation of The Mourning)!
* A few stops in Zilargo eventually led the group to Sharn, where they spent several days exploring and learning more about Windsor's life (and parents). Side quests ensued, but eventually plans were made to gather all the parts needed to make a ship.
* Khyber dragonshards were obtained from Blackroot in the Shadow Marches by descending deep into the earth and dealing with cultists of the daelkyr. Then a lovely Forest of Flesh was found on their way back.
* Soarwood was gathered from Aerenal, after sailing the Thunder Sea on the Golden Dragon and definitely not being prisoners.
* A large Siberys dragonshard was found on Xen'drik in the heart of an ancient colossus of the Giants. It was pried from the construct after defeating an actual Giant inside of her dream realm. After discovering an ancient Giant and Quori ruin and learning more about their warforged friend, the group left the continent of Xen'drik.
* Elementals were obtained from the islands of Lorghalen, after recruiting the help of a gnome stonesinger named Rida.
* While the ship was being built in Trolanport, we montaged ahead about six months for each of our party members (Lunar Interlude). Everyone reconvened in Sharn for the wedding of Cecilia and Locke, and they then traveled to Zilargo to leave Eberron for the first time!

#### Chapter 3: The Planes

* The adventures of Chapter 3 revolve around exploration of the planes of Eberron.
* The "inner" planes (Kythri, Lamannia, Syrania, Fernia, Risia, Daanvi) are all watched over by the Sovereign Host and Dark Six, as the "Three Faces" aspects (except for Kythri, which is The Traveler alone). These gods reside on these planes in some form, since they aren't really present on Eberron and are only worshipped as abstract concepts (just as the planes represent abstract concepts).
* The "outer" planes (Xoriat, Irian, Thelanis, Mabar, Dolurrh, Shavarath, Dal Quor) are all watched over by the Endless and their mother, Entropy (or Mother Void). These planes were claimed by Entropy and her children soon after creation, in an act of defiance against the Progenitor Dragons (who brought order to Entropy's world and trapped her within a small pocket of The Outer Darkness). The Endless are not gods, as they don't require worship in order to exist, and will just always exist.
* The BBEG of the chapter is Entropy, but her children are doing much of her bidding. Her intent is to bring as much chaos to Eberron as possible, essentially a trickster god who is sure that as disorder reins, her domain will slowly expand and spread once again. The current plan is to bring about the Third Age of Eberron much sooner than would naturally happen, knowing that the arrogance of the dragons who reign over that age will eventually be enough to release the Daughter of Khyber (Tiamat) and destroy the entire realm.
	* Delirium is uninvolved in the Turning of the Age this time around. She doesn't understand why her mother doesn't want her wandering the Maze like she normally would. But she's a kid, and mostly listens.
	* Desire is mostly uninterested in their Mother's machinations, but their rivalry with their older sibling Dream means they may be willing to divulge information about him and his plane. They don't know anything about the Turning of the Age plan, but they do know about their mother and where she resides, as well as information about their other siblings. They also have a good relationship with their sister Despair.
	* Destiny is completely against his mother's plan, as it goes against the natural order of things in order to speed up the Turning of the Age. So he's unwilling to get involved in the plan in any way, including giving the players information. He's also against Dal Quor since it's at the center of the plans, and will actively work against anyone tied to the plane - which is why he dislikes Astra so much (The Book card from the Cards of Chaos).
	* Despair doesn't care much for her mother or her plans, but she does suspect that successful execution of the plan could make for a more desperate Eberron, which intrigues her. So she won't work against her mother, but she's also uninterested in helping her brother Dream.
	* Death is completely disconnected from the plan, choosing instead to focus only on her job.
	* Destruction has retreated into solace on his own plane, focusing on his art, and unfamiliar with what is going on.
	* Dream is the primary driver behind the plan. He was talked into opening a portal to Eberron's past and changing things by his Mother- even though he knew deep down that it wouldn't really change anything (or get Nada back). The portal was really just some part of Mother Void's plan, that Dream doesn't know the details of. He does know she revels in chaos though.
