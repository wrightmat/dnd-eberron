>Our time here is magic! It's the only space you have to realize whatever it is that is beautiful, whatever is true, whatever is great, whatever is potential, whatever is rare, whatever is unique... - Ben Okri

### Theme(s)

* Magic, Power, and Life

### DM Notes

* Main concept is the nature of [[Magic]], and its power in the world, using Buddhist/Jainist ideals.
* Use the [[Path of Light]] as the primary organization to drive the story. Turns out their views of magic have been right all along. Maybe a member of their order is the BBEG?
* Whoever the BBEG is, his goal is to essentially collect all the Mana for himself, turning himself into a god (the first true god of Eberron, higher than the Sovereigns).
* Should start the players out in Arcanix (or another University, or even a newly established school in Argonnessen, actually founded by Chamber dragons), and maybe even run a Strixhaven-like chapter to start the story (beginning with meeting on the first day of classes in their first year). Each player should have some significant tie to magic - so discourage full martial classes like fighters and barbarians, but if used then the PC should think about where their power comes from, and how they want to grow their power as part of their character arc.
	* Could be fun to have different lectures that outline how each of the classes manipulate Mana to create magical effects.

* The assault on Strixhaven became the perfect misdirection for the BBEG's true goals. During the ensuing chaos, he entered the Biblioplex and descended into the Hall of Oracles to harness the power of the Strixhaven Snarl, a maelstrom of power left behind from the creation of the world. The party likely tries to intervene (or if not then one of the professors can), but are transported away the instant they get close to the Snarl. They land somewhere in Khorvaire, accompanied by a professor who was trying to help, and who can direct them to the other magical schools of Eberron so they can learn more about the nature of magic and how to take on the BBEG.

* As the story progresses, evidence of magic drain across Eberron should become apparent. As a wide magic world, this may be subtle at first, but maybe basic spells like *[[prestidigitation]]*, that's used everywhere for lots of things, stop working.
* Should try to do some sort of progression based on the different schools of magic (sort of like previously done with the skills), probably in Act 2. This should tie in various magical schools across Eberron.
	* Arcanix (Aundair) - Transmutation
	* Korranberg (Zilargo) - Illusion
		* Adapt Candlekeep, as needed
	* Adar (Sarlona) - Enchantment
	* Morgrave (Breland) - Evocation
	* Rekkenmark (Karrnath) - Abjuration
	* Atur (Karrnath) - Necromancy
	* University of Wynarn (Aundair) - Divination
	* Strixhaven - Conjuration
* At Strixhaven, give each PC/Student a real planner/calendar, with all of the major school events, weekly class schedules, Eberron holidays, interesting facts, etc.
