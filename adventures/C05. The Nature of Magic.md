### Theme(s)

* Magic, Power, and Life

### DM Notes

* Main concept is the nature of [[Magic]], and its power in the world, using Buddhist/Jainist ideals.
* Use the [[Path of Light]] as the primary organization to drive the story. Turns out their views of magic have been right all along. Maybe a member of their order is the BBEG?
* Whoever the BBEG is, his goal is to essentially collect all the Mana for himself, turning himself into a god (the first true god of Eberron, higher than the Sovereigns).
* Should start the players out in Arcanix (or another University), and maybe even run a Strixhaven-like chapter to start the story (beginning with meeting on the first day of classes in their first year). Each player should have some significant tie to magic - so discourage full martial classes like fighters and barbarians, but if used then the PC should think about where their power comes from, and how they want to grow their power as part of their character arc.
	* Could be fun to have different lectures that outline how each of the classes manipulate Mana to create magical effects.

* As the story progresses, evidence of magic drain across Eberron should become apparent. As a wide magic world, this may be subtle at first, but maybe basic spells like *[[prestidigitation]]*, that's used everywhere for lots of things, stop working.
* Should try to do some sort of progression based on the different schools of magic (sort of like previously done with the skills), probably in Act 2.
* At Arcanix, give each PC/Student a real planner/calendar, with all of the major school events, weekly class schedules, Eberron holidays, interesting facts, etc.
