### Stories

**Alchemist's Fire**. "Procured from a dwarf alchemist known for her explosive temper and even more explosive concoctions. She aimed to mimic the fiery breath of a dragon, and though she never saw a dragon herself, she certainly got close with this."

**Bag of Holding**. "Crafted by dwarven artificers deep in the Mror Holds, this bag is said to hold the entirety of a clan's treasure during a great siege. It's not just spacious; it's a symbol of dwarven resilience and ingenuity."

**Potion of Healing**. "This particular batch was blessed by priests of the Sovereign Host in a ceremony honoring Boldrei, symbolizing the hearth and home. Dwarves believe that the strength of a community, much like the toughness of their kin, is key to overcoming adversity."

**Cloak of Protection**. "Woven by the Silverbeard Clan, known for their weavers who imbue their cloths with protective spells. It's said that wearing one of these cloaks is like being watched over by the spirit of a stalwart dwarf ancestor."

**Immovable Rod**. "Invented by a curious dwarf tinkerer who was fascinated by the idea of creating an unmovable object. It's rumored he tested it by trying to stop a charging bullette. The rod didn't budge, though he spent a month recovering."

**Driftglobe**. "Recovered from a dragon's hoard, this globe still carries the enchantment of its draconic previous owner, designed to light the depths of its lair. Now, it serves as a beacon for adventurers delving into the darkness of the world."

**Flame Tongue**. "This blade was forged in the breath of a red dragon by a legendary dwarven smith as part of a pact between the dragon and the dwarf's clan. The dragon provided fire, and in return, the clan crafted a hoard of weapons, with this sword as the centerpiece."

**Dust of Dryness**. "A marvel of dwarven engineering intended for mining operations where water threatened to flood the tunnels. Just a pinch can dry an area instantly, making it invaluable for excavating ancient ruins or navigating through the treacherous terrains of the Mror Holds."

**Elixir of Health**. "Brewed by a renowned dwarf herbalist who spent decades studying the regenerative properties of plants found in dragon territories. Her goal was to create an elixir that mimicked a dragon's vitality, appealing to both dwarves and dragon scholars alike."

**Decanter of Endless Water**. "Originally owned by a dwarven clan settled in a desert region, this decanter was their lifeline, creating water to sustain their underground city. Legends say it was a gift from a water elemental grateful for the clan's protection from a fire giant incursion."
