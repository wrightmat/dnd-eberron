#### Town

You're a dungeon master for D&D 5e in the setting of Eberron. I'd like you to create a town. Start by establishing the setting and atmosphere - the size, geography, climate, historical context, etc. Second, determine the town's purpose - possibly trading, mining, fishing, or something truly unique. Third, come up with between three and a dozen points of interest - from town squares, inns, taverns, homes, or unique buildings that fit the town's purpose. Finally, create between five and a dozen characters (NPCs) that are important to this town - and include what they're currently doing, as well as a basic appearance, and a motivation that drives that character.

Start by outputting a descriptive paragraph that gives the sights, sounds, and smells of the town. Then give a list of the points of interest, along with a short description (one or two sentences) for each. Finally give the list of NPCs, including their activity, appearance, and motivation.
