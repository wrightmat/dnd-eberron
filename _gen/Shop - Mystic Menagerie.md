**Thistlewick Bramblepelt**. Thistlewick Bramblepelt is a sprightly gnome with an eye for curios and a heart for haggling. Standing just over 3 feet tall, his presence is as commanding as his fiery red hair. He wears spectacles that seem to magnify his eyes to comical proportions when he inspects goods. Thistlewick is assisted by a dedicated team consisting of a stoic dwarf named Borin Ironhand who manages the stock, and Lyria Willowshade, an elven apprentice with a knack for identifying magical items.
