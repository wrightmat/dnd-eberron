Long before anyone had dreamed of the Unity of Riedra, the Empire of Nulakesh was the most powerful force in Sarlona. Beginning as a single city-state, its legions conquered and assimilated the people of the surrounding region, incorporating them into its war machine. At its height, the Empire of Nulakesh dominated much of what's now Pyrine and Dor Maleer. The empire waxed and waned many times; its current borders reflect the lands it held when the Inspired rebellion finally wiped out the Imperial line at the end of the First Sundering.

Nulakesh was at a low point when the First Sundering began. The Dreaming Dark began by firing up the people’s imperial spirit, giving the emperor and warlords dreams of regaining their past glories. The Sundering lasted for generations, and the resurgent Nulakesh was just the beginning of their plans. It became a tool they used to cripple surrounding nations — the force that fiercely battled the foul serpent-people of Khalesh and brought righteous fury to Ohr Kaluun. Along the way, the quori encouraged the emperors to indulge in ever-greater acts of cruel tyranny, and to work with their Daanvian devils (who were acting independently, with no idea of the role they were playing in the quori’s greater schemes). Even
the stoic Nulakeshi had a breaking point… but as they grew close to it, the first Inspired rose up, promising to overthrow the tyrants — whom they revealed to be working with devils! — and to lead the people on the true path of righteousness, cleansing all the foulness from Sarlona.

### At A Glance

* Population: 1,100,000 (93% humans, 3% Chosen/Inspired, 2% changelings, 2% other)
* Environments: Temperate and cold plains, forests, and mountains
* Major Settlements: Dul Natath, Dar Terash, Dul Zerath, Dar Darath, Dar Reth
* Planar Elements: Nulakesh is strongly influenced by Daanvi and Shavarath, causing the Nulakeshi to be driven by war and order. This drives deep martial instincts and an innate aptitude for martial discipline… a legacy that also lingers in Karrnath today. Nulakesh has many manifest zones tied to Shavarath. These were the foundations of most of the ancient city-states, and still are today; Nulakesh provides the bulk of the soldiers of the Harmonious Shield, and even Nulakeshi peasants engage in regular martial drills. However, the region also has wild zones, and these have been a danger throughout its history.  The region’s Daanvian zones are less dramatic, but they are largely tied to the oppressive layers of Daanvi. The ancient capital of the empire, the city of Nulakar, was built in a zone tied to Daanvi’s Iron Ward. There are only a few wild zones tied to Dolurrh in Nulakesh, but they are noteworthy. The Imperial Crypt, the royal necropolis, had curious powers of resurrection.
