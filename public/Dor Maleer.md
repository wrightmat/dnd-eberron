Dor Maleer is a region of harsh plains, cold deserts, and mountains. Its barren land is only slightly more hospitable than the Tashana Tundra that lies to the north. In the days before the First Sundering, the northern mountains were the domain of the Doriak dwarves, while the plains were claimed by the Hual Maleer, a loose federation of human and shifter clans.

Dor Maleer was never a strongly united nation. The first step for the Dreaming Dark was to drive a wedge between the Hual Maleer, causing tensions between clans and between human and shifter. Inspired champions arose within the clans, uniting them and spreading the word of the Path of Unity. The psychic Doriak proved resistant to the manipulations of the Dreaming Dark, but the quori amplified fear and conflict between them and the people of the lowlands. As the Unity of Riedra emerged, the first true Inspired offered peace to the Doriak, and paid them handsomely for their aid in creating the hanbalani and other elements of Riedran infrastructure. But once the dwarves had served their purpose, Riedra turned on them, launching a brutal preemptive strike. The Doriak survivors were driven from their mountain home and into the Tashana Tundra.

Since the Second Sundering, the Doriak have started to return to Dor Maleer, re-establishing former settlements that were nothing but ruins during the Unity.

### At A Glance

* Population: 380,000 (73% humans, 15% shifters, 4% changelings, 3% ogres/ogre mages, 3% dwarves, 2% other)
* Environments: Cold deserts, mountains, and plains
* Major Settlements: Dar Vuleer
* Planar Elements: Dor Maleer contains multiple wild zones and manifest zones tied to Lamannia, showcasing the versatility of that plane. Lamannia embodies the power of nature, and that includes deadly storms, frigid tundras, raging volcanoes, and more. The plains of Dor Maleer are broken up by regions of environmental extremes at odds with the surroundings. Wild zones could cause endless hurricanes, with free-roaming air elementals howling with the winds. There are vast pools of lava in the Maleeri plains, and fire elementals occasionally emerge to scorch the soil. There are also a few wild zones where the environment is more welcoming — a stretch of dense forest, an imposasibly verdant valley. Maleeri hunters forage and hunt in these regions, but attempting to settle them is unwise, as disease and megafauna are common. The mountains of Dor Maleer contain wild zones tied to Risia and Dolurrh.

### Religion and Culture

The Frostblade (Paqaa) Mountains were once the home of the Doriak dwarves, a dwarf culture that produces mountain, hill, and gray dwarves. The Doriak duergar are thought to be a mutation resulting from generations dwelling in the radius of the Dolurrh wild zones, and they have an unusually strong bond to Dolurrh. This often results in a dampened emotional affect; though they aren’t paralyzed by the infamous ennui of Dolurrh, the Doriak are somber by nature.

Doriak duergar hear the whispers of spirits, both the voices of their own ancestors and of others who have died in the places they pass through. These voices usually form an incomprehensible chorus. However, some Doriak duergar hone their skills and become mediums. All duergar can
learn to channel this babel, harnessing this choir of excess thought as pure psionic power; it’s by channeling this power that a duergar can hide from the perceptions of others or temporarily expand their mass. Doriak champions learn to wield this power to produce devastating effects. In the days before the First Sundering, the Doriak pioneered the development of psionic tools and channeling devices; the hanbalani monoliths that ensure Inspired dominance over Riedra are based on Doriak techniques.

### Art and Architecture

This harsh frontier region can’t support the civic infrastructure that is common throughout the rest of Riedra. As such, there is only a single bastion city: Dar Vuleer, a port on Lake Kelneluun. This city is in a Lamannia manifest zone that allows limited agriculture and exceptional fishing. The fortress of Kintarn Malin coordinates the defense of the northeastern border and also serves as a training center for the shifters of the Taskaan Legion. Beyond this, Maleeri villages are smaller and more loosely structured than their southern counterparts.
