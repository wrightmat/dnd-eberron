##### Sphinx Sightings on the Rise

The number of citizen sightings of mysterious creatures known as sphinxes have been on the rise over the last several months. While these sightings have been reported to various authorities all over Khorvaire, the sighting being reports to The Trust and to the Chronicle have centered primarily on the Shimmerwood Forest in the south of Zilargo. No one has reported direct interaction with any of these creatures, and no one knows why they have been seen more recently. The Trust has of course made no comment, but this reporter suspects that they and others may be looking into these sightings already, or will be soon.
