The island kingdom of Ohr Kaluun may be the most infamous nation in the history of Khorvaire. Its lords were ruthless in their pursuit of supernatural power, committing countless atrocities in their quest for mystical might. It’s thought that the first changelings were created in Ohr Kaluun, and spread to Khorvaire in a wave of refugees. Likewise, refugees from Ohr Kaluun are believed to be the ancestors of the humans found in the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes.

The people of Sarlona always feared and hated Ohr Kaluun, and Pyrine, Nulakesh, and Khalesh had clashed with the island in the past. Fear of Ohr Kaluun was a common thread the quori used in stirring up conflict across Sarlona; on the island itself, it was easy to amplify the existing paranoia and feuds of the Shadow Lords until it reached a breaking point. The Shadow Lords had weakened one another long before they were destroyed by the combined forces of Nulakesh and Corvagura, united by their Inspired champions.

As with Khalesh, the Inspired were ruthless in their cleansing of Ohr Kaluun during the Age of the Dreaming Dark. The vast majority of its people were simply slain. The war mazes were nearly impossible to destroy, but were blocked off and shunned.

Ohr Kaluun is sparsely populated today; aside from Dar Kel, its legitimate inhabitants are mainly dedicated to fishing, and they avoid the inland ruins. However, as an area shunned by most, it’s a haven for smugglers (including the faction known as the Dream Merchants) and renegades.

### At A Glance

* Population: 72,000 (67% humans, 12% skulks, 8% changelings, 5% shifters, 5% dwarves, 2% ogres/ogre mages, 1% other)
* Environments: Temperate plains and hills
* Major Settlements: Dar Kel
* Planar Elements: The influences of Xoriat, Mabar, and Kythri permeate the islands of Ohr Kaluun, even beyond their manifest zones and wild zones; the islands also hold lesser manifest zones tied to other planes. These powerful forces shaped the psyche of the Kaluunite people. Mabar wiped away empathy, driving people to be cruel and predatory. Kythri drove constant change, a quest for innovation and endless emerging factions. And Xoriat inspired the Kaluunites to pursue strange and terrible visions, to attempt things no mundane mind would consider.

### Religion and Culture

Throughout most of its history, Ohr Kaluun was ruled by an alliance of Shadow Lords. In theory, these were hereditary bloodlines, but in practice, the title was held by whoever could claim power and hold on to it, and feuds and uprisings were common. Ohr Kaluun is well known for its war mazes, vast labyrinths that served as both fortresses and cities. Each Shadow Lord dwelled at the heart of a great maze, pursuing their own paths to power and scheming against their rivals. Each lord generally followed a different path to power, and a maze would be devoted to a particular sinister patron, whether that was a member of the Dark Six, an overlord, or an archfiend from one of the planes. While there were a few Kaluunite lords known to have actually been loved by their people, the influences of Mabar and Xoriat drove the Kaluunites to horrific excess and cruelty. If you're ever looking for an image of a classically evil cult, for people willfully embracing the service of fiends or performing vile sacrifices, there are surely tales of Ohr Kaluun that serve that need.

### Art and Architecture

Every war maze was built within a manifest zone, and the influence of each zone colored the practices and achievements of its inhabitants. Evidence suggests that both the skulks and the changelings were created in Ohr Kaluun, using magebreeding techniques that surely drew on the power of Kythri. The influence of Xoriat led them to pursue paths of magic no rational mind would conceive of. Thus, while Ohr Kaluun was known for its warlocks, the Kaluunites dealt with many different patrons; one maze might use the Fiend patron to reflect bargains with native fiends, another would use the Great Old One to reflect dealing with Xoriat, while another might use the Hexblade to reflect bargains with the Dark Powers of Mabar. The priests of Ohr Kaluun revered the Dark Six, but different mazes had their own unique pairings, names, and interpretations of the Six.

A critical aspect of this chaotic history is that almost any mystical approach could be found in a Kaluunite war maze. We’ve never mentioned Ohr Kaluun as working with the daelkyr or symbionts — but there certainly could have been a Shadow Lord who bargained with Belashyrra. Necromancy wasn’t a widespread practice in Ohr Kaluun, but adventurers could be drawn into a war maze whose lord dealt with the Bone King of Mabar, and whose mummy still rules over the deadly tomb.

### Development

* During the Quiet Year, Ohr Kaluun discovered an infernal engine, which started gaining power unexpectedly, then disappeared (taking several researchers with it). Laterm a body of one of the researchers was found on an entirely different island. Even later, the engine itself appeared in Pyrine, only to disappear once more with a couple more people.
* Near the end of the Quiet Year, Ohr Kaluun had a revolution where the aristocracy was killed and the people took power. Then they almost immediately instated a king.
