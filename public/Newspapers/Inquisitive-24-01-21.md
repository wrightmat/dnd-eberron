#### Keeper of the Flame Jaela Daran Dead

The Church of the Silver Flame has recently publicized the death of their Keeper of the Flame, Jaela Daran, who was 64 years old. The Keeper actually passed away on 2 Zarantyr, according to the Church, but the statement was only released last week. The release of the statement coincided with the draping in black of all Church of the Silver Flame temples, as is the Church's tradition. Representatives of the Council of Cardinals have stated that the selection process for a new Keeper of the Flame may begin as early as next week, but were unable to comment on details of the process.
