Originally an NPC played by [[Kerrie Heath]] during [[3-03. The Orphanage Flashback]]

Gunnora was raised in an orphanage in Daskaran with several other orphans, where she had an adventure with a tiger at a young age. This led her to become interested in fighting, and she would often be found in the courtyard outside of the orphanage playing with a wooden sword that she had fashioned. But eventually she aged out of the system, and had nowhere to go. Given her half-elf heritage, she decided to venture to the newly founded land of the elf warlords - Valenar.

Little did Gunnora know about the dangers that lied between her former home of Thrane and her destination of Valenar - the dead-grey mists of the Mournland. When she arrived in the town of Vathirond, she came face-to-face with the wall of mist, as well as the monstrous creatures that occasionally emerged from it. She spent years in Vathirond, dealing with whatever wandered out of the mists, and slowly learning more about the mysterious Mournland - eventually becoming a bit of a folk hero among the few people who still resided there.

After the many years of training, Gunnora decided it was time to finally step through the mists. She spent what felt like decades (but was more likely mere months) wandering the expansive wasteland, happening upon various features such as the Glass Plateau and the Crimson Waters. One day, while facing off against a large group of hideously deformed monsters that were clearly too much for her, she was saved by a large mechanical man, who later introduced himself as the Lord of Blades. Gunnora resided in the warforged camp for several years, where she learned many advanced fighting techniques from the Lord of Blades, and become quite close with him (even learning of his true identity as Aeren d'Cannith) - becoming an honorary member of "The Blades". But eventually she decided it was time to continue her original journey to find a home among her people, and The Blades accompanied her to the eastern border of the Mournland.

Gunnora first found herself in Taer Valior, where she met Shan Kaelan - the lord of the fortress, and a hardened leader interested in the Mournland. They become close as Gunnora told Shan all about her travels and training in the mists.

Gunnora is a Champion Fighter / Artificer (1 level), two weapon fighting style, who dual wields a scimitar and shortsword, and likes to cast Booming Blade when attacking.
