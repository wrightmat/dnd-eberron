Staff (full name Staffanie) works at the arcane university where her parents teach - but she's a clerk (copies scrolls and such). She goes out adventuring in her free time.

One day on the job, Staff found a slip of paper with a call to adventure in a book about sphinxes. She talked an old flame into teleporting her to  Sharn.

Her parents are Wanda (Wand) and Roderick (Rod).
