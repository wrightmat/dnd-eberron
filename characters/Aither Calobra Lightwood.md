### Backstory

Aither follows the Path of Light (which is now more dedicated to healing and spreading the light), and is a refugee from the former Unity of Riedra. She now resides in the largest monastery in Kasshta, traveling to other places as needed. She spends her day making rounds through the sick, healing them. Aither considers the monastery her family, as well as all other genasi.

On a pilgrimage to another monastery to help the people there, Aither witnessed a black dragon drain the life from every monk in the monastery with a single breath weapon attack. While burying the bodies, she found a coin on one of the them, with Morgrave University on one side and "City of Towers" on the other. After returning to her monastery and telling her monastery leader about the attack, she set off for Sharn on a ship chartered by the monastery.

### Motivation and Goal(s)

Heal people and spread the light, while fulfilling the task of investigating the topaz dragon attack.

Also would like to lean hard into the concept of a dragon monk!
