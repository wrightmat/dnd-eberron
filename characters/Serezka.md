The primary technology stealing sect in [[Shardspace]] is led by a woman named Serezka who has a very loyal crew due to her ability and brutality. The sect is sometimes called The Whisperers, due to their taking up residence in the fabled githyanki hall known as Susurrus, or the Palace of Whispers.
