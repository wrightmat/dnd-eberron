The primary technology stealing sect is led by a woman named Serezka (inspired by Seska from ST: Voyager) who has a very loyal crew due to her ability and brutality. The sect is sometimes called The Whisperers, due to their taking up residence in the fabled githyanki hall known as Susurrus, or the Palace of Whispers.
