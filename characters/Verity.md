Verity's father (Aeon, an angel of Syrania) and mother (Linaria, a human) met because their father admired how devoted their mother was to the Sovereigns. Verity grew up as the eldest among their siblings (all aasimar) and took the role as the shining example for them to follow. In Verity's early adulthood, their mother became ill and would likely die soon. On their next visit to Syrania to see their father, someone from the Immeasurable Market told her that they had the cure for their mother at the cost of another's soul. Desperate to save a member of their family, they stole the cure to deliver it to their mother. They confessed to how they got it, and pleaded for their mother to tell no one. Her mother refused the cure entirely and did not hide Verity's theft, resulting in their fall.

Verity is from Dar Ilash in Pyrine. They serve as a guide to tourists of the area, who gives historical background and religious information (for a price).

They found a call to adventure at Morgrave University on one of the many temple bulletin boards, and chartered a room on a ship to get to Khorvaire.

### Family

Aeon is cold and distant, and basically uncaring about mortals.

Siblings (Joy and Honor) are still in Pyrine.

### Motivation and Goal(s)

Moral redemption for their past and present. Also acceptance from others (and to an extent from themself) in that she can be herself and still be accepted.

Wants to lean into illusion magic to solve problems and use of their Actor feat to appear like others.
