### Backstory

Verity is from Dar Ilash in Pyrine. They serve as a guide to tourists of the area, who gives historical background and religious information (for a price). 

They found a call to adventure at Morgrave University on one of the many temple bulletin boards, and chartered a room on a ship to get to Khorvaire.
