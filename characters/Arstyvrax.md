The practice of necromancy is forbidden among the dragons of Argonnessen, but Arstyvrax is one of this land’s foremost practitioners of the dark art. He is the leader of the Shadowmasters — a cabal of a dozen necromancer dragons who share lore and maintain secret libraries scattered across the Vast.

Like most Argonnessen dragons, the Shadowmasters share a steadfast enmity for the Undying Court of Aerenal. Unlike their so-called elders in the Conclave, however, these dragon necromancers believe that understanding the power of The Shadow is the only way to ultimately prevail against the Aereni and their undying lords. What not even the other Shadowmasters suspect is that Arstyvrax has a very different purpose to his studies. He is secretly a vampiric dragon who seeks to advance his power even further by taking on the Sovereign Archetype of The Shadow.

Arstyvrax joined the ranks of the undead some two hundred years past, becoming the first and only Obsidian Gem Dragon (with all of his followers being Topaz Gem Dragons). Already an initiate into the necromantic arts, he was doing fieldwork in Xen’drik (in the Obsidian City) when he fell to a vampiric greatwyrm’s assault.

#### History

* Arstyvrax began as a teacher of necromancy magic at Strixhaven (the premiere magic school in Argonnessen), in the Witherbloom school, as a young topaz dragon. As he advanced through his years of teaching, he eventually joined a top secret cabal known as the Shadowmasters that was starting up at the school.
* After many decades, he eventually ascended to become Dean of the Vein at Witherbloom. Using that promotion as a launching point, he established a campaign to become leader of the Shadowmasters, and won.
* The selection ceremony for the Loredrake of the Shadowmasters involves creation of a soulshard by the members of the cabal, which is then used as a symbolic focus of the ceremony and then removed and hidden away by another dragon. The intent being that even if their leader were killed, they would rise again in another location far from danger. Arstyvrax's was entrusted to an academic white dragon known as Kazdurakashtan, who was departing for an exploratory expedition to the Frostfell.
* Unfortunately, news of the Shadowmasters cabal at Strixhaven eventually got out, and the administration of the school shut it down and fired the leader as retaliation. Now without a purpose in life, Arstyvrax decided to embark on his own exploratory expedition to the rumored source of the necromantic magic he had studied his entire life - the continent of Xen'drik where the Umbragen drow once flourished. But when he arrived, he found nothing but a small settlement of Sulatar drow, and a nearby cave. When he entered the cave, he was immediately and brutally attacked by an ancient greatwyrm, but instead of dying, he awoke changed. He had become more vampiric in nature, and had changed into a dark obsidian.
* Arstyvrax attempted to return to Argonnessen but was initially shunned by anyone he knew. Because of this, he became reclusive for some time. One night, when he was staring out at the stars alone, the sky became pitch black - all the stars, moons, and the ring enveloped by some kind of impossibly black cloud. The cloud then coalesced, moving nearer to him, and began speaking. The cloud was an entity known as Mother Void, who had a proposition for the dragon - to reclaim what the dragons deserved, and gain power for himself in the process. She encouraged him to attack Shae Mordai, the seat of the Undying Court which his order already hated. With her power behind him, and the support of the other topaz dragons, he couldn't fail. And all of that magic from the souls of the undying should be channeled into an effort to return the Queen of Dragons, Tiamat, to her throne. When Tiamat ruled once more, Arstyvrax would be elevated to the station he deserved - to become the Sovereign Archetype dragon known as The Shadow.

#### Loredrake

Magic flows through every dragon’s blood. The loredrake devotes their life to harnessing this power and understanding the mysteries of magic. The most accomplished priests of the Dragon Gods and students of the draconic Prophecy are typically loredrakes, and it is the dragons of this path that uncovered the greatest mysteries of arcane magic. Most dragons have great respect for loredrakes, but not all loredrakes are noble creatures. Darkness abides in magic along with light, and a loredrake must decide whether he answers the call of the Shadow.
**Sovereigns**: Aureon, The Shadow.
