Stat block: [[creatures/Arstyvrax|Arstyvrax]]

The practice of necromancy is forbidden among the dragons of Argonnessen, but Arstyvrax is one of this land’s foremost practitioners of the dark art. He is the  leader of the Shadowmasters — a cabal of a dozen necromancer dragons who share lore and maintain secret libraries scattered across the Vast.

Like most Argonnessen dragons, the Shadowmasters share a steadfast enmity for the Undying Court of Aerenal. Unlike their so-called elders in the Conclave, however, these dragon necromancers believe that understanding the power of The Shadow is the only way to ultimately prevail against the Aereni and their undying lords. What not even the other Shadowmasters suspect is that Arstyvrax has a very different purpose to his studies. He is secretly a vampiric dragon who has ties to the Blood of Vol, and seeks to advance his power even further by taking on the Sovereign Archetype of the Loredrake and ascending to The Shadow.

Arstyvrax joined the ranks of the undead some two hundred years past, becoming the first and only Obsidian Gem Dragon (with all of his followers being Topaz Gem Dragons). Already an initiate into the necromantic arts, he was doing fieldwork in Xen’drik (in the Obsidian City) when he fell to a vampiric wyrm’s assault. That foul undead was the servant of a Blood of Vol high priest operating secretly out of Stormreach. In his tortured mental state, Arstyvrax quickly latched onto the teachings of the cult as a means to accept and justify his horrid transformation.

#### Loredrake

Magic flows through every dragon’s blood. The loredrake devotes their life to harnessing this power and understanding the mysteries of magic. The most accomplished priests of the Dragon Gods and students of the draconic Prophecy are typically loredrakes, and it is the dragons of this path that uncovered the greatest mysteries of arcane magic. Most dragons have great respect for loredrakes, but not all loredrakes are noble creatures. Darkness abides in magic along with light, and a loredrake must decide whether he answers the call of the Shadow.
