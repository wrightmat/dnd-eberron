Corrine ir'Wynarn is the current empress of the Aundair. She is the youngest daughter of the late Aurala ir'Wynarn. When Corrine came into power, she removed the title queen and turned it into empress as a decree. She deemed that their nation was strong and proud enough to be considered an empire. Corrine now resides at the palace in the Royal Court of Fairhold, or simply Fairhold, in the city of Fairhaven in Aundair (although she often returns to the Eldeen Reaches for business).

* Aurala ir'Wynarn died unexpectedly while attending a public event in Fairhaven.
* Corrine, who had moved to the Eldeen Reaches after graduating from Arcanix, returned to Aundair accompanied by a new man (who is actually a green dragon in disguise, which she knows but others don't, see "Kaereth" below).
* Secretly when she was in the Eldeen Reaches she started working with the green dragons to further their goals in exchange for their help to take over Aundair when the opportunity arose. This opportunity presented itself when her mother died unexpectedly.
* She and the green dragons now intend to take out the gold dragons of Thrane and expand the nation of Aundair back into their ancestral territory of the Eldeen Reaches as well as the territory of Thrane.
* Corinne is a dragonmarked heir with the House Vadalis Mark of Handling (which she inherited from her father), which she usually hides under a lace glove (since it's on her hand). She actually used the name Vadalis until she returned to Aundair when she took back her mother's name. Unlike her mother, she doesn't hide her favoritism toward House Vadalis.

**Kaerethalyn AKA “Kaereth”** (male green dragon disguised as a human). Kaereth appears as a tall, lean human with sharp, angular features and striking green eyes that seem almost unnatural in their brightness. He keeps his dark hair swept back, adding to his air of polished, understated elegance. His attire is often subtly regal, favoring deep green and dark brown robes that allude to his true nature without giving it away. His voice is smooth and calculated, each word chosen with care, exuding a sense of intellect and mystery. In his human guise, Kaereth is soft-spoken but commands a magnetic presence, marked by a penetrating gaze that seems to see through deception and into one’s true motives. He has a natural affinity for the political and social games of court life and frequently advises Corrine on matters of subtle influence and persuasion. Kaereth is a master of misdirection, skilled in guiding people to act in ways that align with his goals while making them believe it was their own idea. As a green dragon, Kaerethalyn embodies cunning and ambition. His alliance with Corrine is driven by his desire to create a domain of control over both humans and dragons, one that he hopes will flourish under the return of Tiamat. Although loyal to Corrine’s ambitions, Kaerethalyn ultimately views her as a means to achieve his own greater vision—a region under his own influence where he can reign as a hidden power, controlling both mortals and dragons alike.
