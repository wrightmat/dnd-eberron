Thana lived in Shae Mordai before it fell, and was present when the attack occured. When she woke up, she had become dhampir, and didn't remember anything that happened.

Now she lives in Dar Ulatesh (the largest city) in Rhiavhaar and does odd funeral jobs (including house calls to pick up bodies and such). She found the posting about Morgrave University on a job board while on her rounds. Then she took an odd job on a ship headed to Khorvaire.

### Family

Thana has no family in Sarlona, but has at least some family alive in Aerenal. Her uncle, Elyon, is an Deathguard Warden in Shae Cairdal, whose domain is Sarlona.

Her father has similar hair and such as her, while her mother has similar features with blonde hair.

Her grandmother ("mee-maw") is a Deathless who is entombed in the basement of the Temple to the Undying Court in Shae Cairdal.

### Motivation and Goal(s)

Alex: "I think my ultimate goal is for her to learn to accept the way she is now. Because she really believes everyone in her faith would now hate her for what she is. And they might. But ultimately for her to accept that she is still good even in her current state, despite it all, is kinda my end goal for her."
