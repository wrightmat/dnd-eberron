The Prince of Slime is the daelkyr lord of slime and ooze.

Kyrzin's chosen form roughly approximates a humanoid shape. He has the head and torso of a handsome human male, suspended in a green ooze with his human aspects partially dissolved.

Kyrzin cannot speak, and communicates exclusively through telepathy. He is surrounded by an aura of babbling madness similar to the whispers of gibbering mouthers, which his followers believe he created along with other creatures such as oozes and mimics.
