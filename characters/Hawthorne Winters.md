- Owns an Inn in a small town in Sarlona (Ardhmen, Syrkarn).
- His daughter (Lyra) left for Strixhaven, even though Hawthorne objected initially, and then disappeared without a trace.

### Motivation and Goal(s)

### DM Notes

- Lyra was taken by the Oriq, possibly willingly. That way she can appear later on in the campaign (before they leave Strixhaven), which gives Hawthorne even more motivation to get back to Argonnessen and take on the Oriq threat.
