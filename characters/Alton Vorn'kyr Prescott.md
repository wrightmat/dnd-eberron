 #pc 

- From Xen'drik (Stormreach), but moved to Khorvaire long ago (probably somewhere in Aundair).
* Recently widowed (shitty wife), so decided to live his dream and go to school.
* Equivalent to early 20s (being an elf), so is basically a traditional student.

### Motivation and Goal(s)

- Wants to follow the dreams he's always had, while also learning to defend himself.
- Wants to live his life how he wants to live it - rather than how his wife told him to live it (so he's not entirely sure what that means yet).

### Development
