Jaela Daran is an eleven-year-old human girl who serves as the Keeper of the Flame, the spiritual leader of the Church of the Silver Flame. She lives in the Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Flamekeep, Thrane. She is one of the strongest clerics on Eberron, but has to stay near Flamekeep with the Silver Flame in order to receive her powers.

Jaela is a dark-skinned human with grey eyes. Her hair is black with light streaks through it, which she wears it cropped short. She usually dresses in simple apparel of dull shades of grey and black and is rarely seen wearing any footwear, preferring to walk the marble corridors bare-footed.
