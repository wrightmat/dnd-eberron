"I have named the wind that blows through my lair (Gusstrill) and speak to it often. It is my sole companion."

Kazdurakashtan was once a Chamber agent, but he decided to go rogue in Khorvaire to aid the humanoid races like the dragon Vvaraak once did. After establishing an order of dragon giants in the frozen north of Frostfell, he settled in Cyre because of a friendship with a Cyran professor, and hoped to negotiate an end to the Last War.

When the Day of Mourning struck Cyre, Kazdurakashtan survived, but the cataclysm horrifically injured and mutated the dragon, driving him insane and causing him to forget his original name. After clawing his way out of the Glowing Chasm, he now lurks deep in the Mournland, searching for treasures to add to his hoard, and devouring anyone who runs across his path. He is now known as Haze-of-Death. His body is now a dismal gray color, and he is constantly surrounded by mist similar to the mist surrounding the Mournland. Patches of scales have fallen off his body, and bony growths protrude from various joints.

Haze-of-Death is an occasional hazard to people entering the Mournland, like Ikar's Salvage or the Khraal Lords. However, he doesn't see the Lord of Blades and his minions as prey, and so the warforged mainly leave the dragon alone. He is constantly paranoid, seeing almost everyone as an enemy trying to steal his hoard.

Haze-of-Death lairs in a place in the Mournland called the Cavern of Flesh. Once a series of hollowed-out hills, Haze-of-Death decorated them with the bodies of soldiers caught in the Mournland. The front entrance is also decorated with hundreds of battle standards.
