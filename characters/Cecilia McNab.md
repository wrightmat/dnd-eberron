A Brelish woman and [[Sharn]] native, Cecilia is a magewright in Lower Dura. Her shop is established in the Callestan district a few blocks down from Mirth, a club run by the Boromar Clan.

Cecilia is courting a warforged thief named Keye (she/her), who has a brother named Locke. Locke and Keye are talented thieves around Lower Sharn and are sought after by major criminal organizations. When she lost the engagement ring she was going to present to Keye gambling in Mirth, she went to Locke for help.

### Development

* Cecelia and Keye got married in a ceremony in Sharn to which they invited a party of adventurers.
* Cecelia has been slowly replacing her body parts with mechanical parts, in an attempt to extend her life and make herself more like her warforged wife.

### References

* Bicentennial Man (but in reverse)
