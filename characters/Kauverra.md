Kauverra is the leader of the Copper Dragons, and runs the Copper Dragon Hotel and Resort in Aerenal.

Kauverra loves her beautiful form. She desires nothing more than to preserve her magnificence and, when possible, improve on it. Several years ago she broke off a fang and used magic to fuse a diamond surrogate in its place. Now she seeks out perfect diamonds, planning to replace all her teeth with the glittering trove.
