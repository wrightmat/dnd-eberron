Yllosavax is the leader of the Silver Scales, Paladin Protectors of the Realm.

Yllosavax aspires to take a leadership role among dragonkind, not only as a protector of Khorvaire but as a respected figure among dragon tribes. This ambition is fueled by a desire to guide dragonkind toward a more harmonious existence, where the interests of dragons align with the greater good. She desires to have the dragons to ultimately lead all of Eberron, just as all dragons do, but doesn't want this to come about by destruction or an early turning of the age (and is therefore against the obsidian dragons and freeing of Tiamat).

Yllosavax also harbors a deep desire for arcane mastery and wishes to ascend to a new level of magical power. Her goal is to uncover ancient arcane secrets and artifacts that would elevate her abilities, allowing her to surpass the limitations of her draconic form. She may even desire a form of immortality so she may lead the dragons into the future.
