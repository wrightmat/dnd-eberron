Chip is a youthful warforged with a slender, humanoid frame, slightly shorter than an average human teenager. His metal and wooden components are polished but show signs of wear and tear, and his face is expressive, with glowing blue eyes that radiate curiosity and warmth. He grew up in a small village in the Mournland known as Greenland, among a community of warforged, where he started to learn magic as an apprentice wizard. When a party of adventurers happened upon the village and promised to show him the world outside of the Mournland, he quickly and happily agreed.

Chip's torso has intricate arcane runes etched into it, softly glowing, indicating his connection to magic. His hands are more delicate and precise compared to other warforged, designed for casting spells rather than combat. He wears a simple, patched-up robe over his metallic body, a gift from his companions, and carries a small, well-used spellbook strapped to his side.

Chip is endlessly curious about the world around him. His artificial mind, designed to learn and adapt, absorbs information rapidly. He often asks questions about things others might take for granted, eager to understand everything from the mechanics of magic to the nuances of social interactions. Chip is still learning about emotions, social cues, and the subtleties of communication. He might take things literally, struggle with sarcasm, or misinterpret certain gestures, leading to moments of awkwardness. However, this is usually endearing, as he genuinely tries his best to fit in.

While he is an apprentice wizard, Chip is aware of the potential dangers of magic. He approaches his studies with a mix of awe and caution, always double-checking his work and hesitating before trying something new. This can make him slower to cast in combat situations, but it also means heâ€™s less likely to make catastrophic mistakes.
