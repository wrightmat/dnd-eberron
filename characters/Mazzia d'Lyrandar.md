Lieutenant Mazzia d'Lyrandar is a khoravar, or half-elf, and a member of House Lyrandar bearing the least Mark of Storm. She works as the first mate on the Golden Dragon. She is in love with the bosun (a ship's officer in charge of equipment and the crew) of the Golden Dragon, Velgram, a half-orc. However, she takes her duties to the ship and to her house too seriously to risk either by indulging her desires.

Mazzia also teaches classes at the Slate Keep sailing academy in Stormhome.
