The Prince of Frost was once the Prince of Summer, but his heart froze when his beloved fled with a mortal hero. The escaping lovers cast their spirits forward in time, and the Prince waits in his castle of frozen tears for their return and his revenge. Until then, he torments all virtuous heroes who cross his path, reflecting the story of a good person turned cruel by loss.
