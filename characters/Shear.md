### DM Notes

- Trey would like a pet of some sort, like maybe a bird (owl probably) or a drake. So Shear should join Familiar House!
- Possibly use something like dream sequences to elucidate Shear's forgotten background.
	- A good initial one would be related to the Owlin of Strixhaven being similar to the Owl Totem protector of the Twilight Forest, Strigix of Lamannia.
