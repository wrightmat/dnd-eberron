>Evil is not an absence of good. […] It is not a choice. […] Evil is one of two forces in the cosmos, an agency locked in eternal struggle against its antithesis. […] Only good and evil exist. And not even a hair's width of space separates them.    — Vecna

On countless worlds, his name evokes tales of terror and cruelty. Vecna the Undying King. Vecna the Whispered One. Vecna the Lord of the Rotted Tower. Over more than a hundred thousand years, incandescent hatred carried him from the humblest of origins to a conqueror’s throne, then to the realms that lie beyond life and death, and finally to godhood. Many have suffered his terrible wrath, but few can recount how a lowly scribe left an aeon-deep scar on the multiverse before ascending beyond the material altogether. Only a few fragments of Vecna’s story have ever been unearthed.

Vecna was a once-human king and lich from Oerth who ascended to godhood. While he was once considered the most powerful lich to dwell on that world, over the ages he spent in undeath Vecna became maligned across the multiverse, and was considered the scourge of all civilization.

According to some, Vecna had an obsession with acquiring and maintaining secrets, believing them to be the source of true power. He was precise and calculating in his actions, but was at times prone to bouts of intense rage. Vecna believed that every being in existence held a single secret that could be manipulated to bring about its destruction. Uncovering that secret and exploiting its truth were the key to gaining dominion over others.

### Relationships

- **Mazzel**. According to Vecna's own accounts, his mortal mother was a wholly evil woman who sacrificed animals and consorted with monstrous beings. It was her cruelty that helped shape the man he was in life and undeath.
- **Mok'slyk (the Serpent)**. Vecna claimed that his intensive knowledge of long forbidden magic was taught to him by Mok’slyk, and that was where he gained his knowledge of ancient secrets relating to magic. Some scholars argue that Vecna was lying, attempting to cover up his true source for these dark magics, while others argue that there’s no other way that Vecna could have discovered the horrible secrets that he used to gain power.
- **Acererak**. One of Vecna's favored wizard generals, who once saved him from battle. Acererak later went on to become a lich himself.
- **Kas**. Vecna was obsessed with taking revenge on his vampire lieutenant and former lover for the legendary betrayal he committed against his master on Oerth.
- **Asmodeus**. Vecna had something of a working relationship with Asmodeus, the powerful archdevil having offered the archlich use of his devil minions. Ironically, Asmodeus' servant Fierna stole a valuable secret from Vecna: that of how to directly travel between the Prime Material plane and the Nine Hells.
- **Falazure the Night Dragon**. One of Vecna's known exarchs was the dragon god of death and undeath's aspect also known as The Reaver.
- **Vocar the Disobedient**. The other of Vecna's known exarchs, who was rumored to possess a powerful secret regarding Vecna himself.
- **The Raven Queen**. The Whispered One was a sworn enemy of the Raven Queen, whom he envied for her unique abilities to tap into the flow of souls and to harvest knowledge. One of his goals was to overthrow the Queen and rule the entire Shadowfell from her Fortress of Memories. His servants constantly battled with the Raven Queen's shadar-kai followers.

### History

#### Mortal Life

Vecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the Flan city of Fleeth on Oerth. His mother, Mazzel, saw great potential in her son, and began training Vecna in the arcane arts, instilling in him a thirst for knowledge and power. Their clandestine activities did not go unnoticed. When their secret was discovered, Mazzel was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. This traumatic event shattered Vecna’s world, filling him with a burning desire for vengeance and a deeper commitment to mastering the arcane arts. Vecna swore revenge upon all those who were responsible for her death and he then disappeared for several years, where he gained a mastery of the dark arts, achieved by no one before him and since. Legend tells that his great power was obtained through tutelage by Mok'slyk, the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself.

Determined to rise above his station and avenge his mother, Vecna began secretly infiltrating higher social circles using his growing magical prowess. He assumed various identities, carefully constructing a facade that allowed him to navigate the realms of power and influence. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and power enabled him to build a network of contacts and allies.

During his clandestine rise to power, Vecna encountered Kas, a young and talented warrior from a noble house known for its martial prowess and connections to dark powers. Vecna and Kas were inexplicably drawn to each other. Their shared ambitions and mutual understanding of the desire for power beyond their societal constraints forged a strong bond. Secretly, they met and discussed their dreams of rising above their stations, becoming more than what society dictated.

#### Rise and Lichdom

After learning all he could from mortals and ancients alike, Vecna spent years researching and planning to become immortal. Once completed, Vecna took his life and was transformed into a lich, though no legend specifies exactly how. Now immortal, Vecna returned to begin his siege on the world he previously abandoned. Conquering the lands in and around Sheldomar Valley, he amassed power and grew his army of undead to unfathomable numbers.

Nearly one thousand years after his birth, Vecna, now a lich and ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the Sheldomar Valley, centered near the modern-day Rushmoors), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. Legend has it that Vecna was nearly slain in this battle by clerics channeling the power of Pholtus, the god of light. The clerics unleashed a great burst of light, which hit Vecna primarily on his left side. Vecna was rescued and brought to safety by one of his wizard generals, a cambion named Acererak (who would one day himself become a mighty demilich).

Vecna eventually recovered. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, Kas, who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials. Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent. Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives.

#### The Sword of Kas

Vecna was now growing ever stronger and beginning his push toward godhood. His empire ranged from the northwestern shores of the Azure Sea to the Crystalmists mountains, including such territories as Ulek, Geoff and Grand March. Not much can be found of Vecna’s rule, other than it was cruel, evil, and he continued to march forward in a quest to conquer as many lands as he could.

As Vecna's power grew, so did his connection with Kas, who also became his instrument of rule. Vecna trusted his lieutenant Kas with most administrative tasks, using necromantic magic to grant him unnatural longevity. Though still Supreme in his power, Vecna took less and less interest in the daily affairs of his kingdom. Kas pronounced Vecna’s judgments, presided over the Council in Vecna’s name, and heard the reports from Lord Vecna’s foul army.

In a gesture of profound trust and affection, Vecna forged a powerful sword for Kas. During the crafting of the Sword of Kas, Vecna imbued it with a piece of his own essence and whispered a powerful secret into the blade: "I love you, Kas." This act infused the sword with deep emotions and dark magic, creating an even stronger connection between Vecna and Kas.

Initially, the sword strengthened Kas, reinforcing his loyalty and bond to Vecna. The whispered secret was comforting and empowering, making Kas feel valued and protected. But as time passed, the sword's influence began to shift subtly. It started adding doubt and fear to its whispers: "Vecna loves you, but can you trust him?" and "Vecna loves you, but does he love power more?" These insidious whispers planted seeds of doubt in Kas’s mind, slowly eroding his mental stability.

The sword’s whispers grew more sinister, suggesting betrayal and hidden motives: "Vecna loves you, but he keeps secrets from you," and "Vecna loves you, but he is planning to replace you." These messages fed Kas’s paranoia and fear of losing Vecna’s affection and trust. The once comforting whispers became a source of anxiety and suspicion, driving a wedge between them.

The sword’s sentient influence began to manipulate Kas more directly, warping the original secret. It whispered, "Vecna loves you, but he doesn’t trust you," and "Vecna’s love is conditional on your obedience." Kas’s growing paranoia led him to believe that Vecna was hiding more secrets and possibly plotting against him. The sword’s dark magic amplified these fears, making Kas more isolated and distrustful. He started to see threats everywhere, including from Vecna himself.

The whispers then pushed Kas toward ambition and rebellion: "Vecna’s love is holding you back," and "Take his power and love yourself first." Kas’s loyalty transformed into a desire for independence and power. The sword, now fully corrupted, fueled Kas’s actions, convincing him that the only way to secure his future and prove his worth was to surpass Vecna.

Driven by the sword’s influence and his own corrupted desires, Kas confronted Vecna during a ritual in his Rotted Tower. Believing that killing Vecna would liberate him from the constant whispers and prove his ultimate power, Kas betrayed his master. The final battle was a tragic culmination of their intertwined fates, driven by the twisted secret that was meant to symbolize their bond. In the end Vecna gained the upper hand, but just as the lich moved to slay his former servant, Kas cut off his hand and plunged his sword into Vecna's left eye. Finally, a massive explosion destroyed the tower and shook the surrounding lands. Kas’s betrayal left both nearly destroyed, but their legacies endured.

#### Death and Ascension

After Kas betrayed and battled with Vecna, he was flung across the multiverse, ending up in the negative energy plane, and losing the Sword of Kas in the process. Because of his prolonged exposure to this plane, where he remained for hundreds of years, he became a vampire. The only traces left of Vecna's physical body were his left hand and eye, which still carried a fragment of the lich's will. Their latent power turned them into the artifacts known as the Hand of Vecna and the Eye of Vecna.

Vecna's spirit endured, however, languishing across the planes and slowly gathering power from the surviving members of his cult; his name continued to instill fear in mortals, and it was said that, through his eponymous artifacts, his evil continued corrupting others. Small pieces of his withered remains scattered across existence, corrupting anyone with whom they came into contact.

After several centuries, Vecna amassed sufficient followers and worshipers among ambitious wizards to reach the status of demigod, and was accepted among the most corrupt powers of the Astral Sea. For failing him, he transformed his most powerful lieutenants into the first of the undead monstrosities known as skull lords. At this point, many, including Elminster, were aware of the threat of Vecna's ascension.

After a failed attempt to ascend to full deity status, Vecna himself was banished to Cavitius, which was drawn into the Domains of Dread by the Dark Powers; his failure freed Kas, whose long exposure to Cavitius's negative energy had transformed him into a vampire. Kas, in turn, became the lord of Tovag, a realm originally from Oerth drawn into the Domains of Dread bordering Cavitius, the two realms forming the Domain of Dread known as the Burning Peaks.

#### Godhood

Some time later, Vecna once again attempted to ascend to the status of greater deity via organizing a centuries-long plot culminating in his absorbing the essence of the demigod Iuz and also invading Sigil, from where he could exert control over the entire multiverse.

Vecna invaded the City of Doors, becoming the only deity in existence that successfully breached Sigil's defenses. When he absorbed the power of Iuz, his power was waxing, and with the help and knowledge granted to him by the Serpent, he was able to disguise his true power and punch a hole into Sigil without having to use a portal. This caused a great disturbance in the multiverse but was once again thwarted by adventurers and expelled from Sigil with assistance from the Lady of Pain. Vecna had his essence separated from Iuz, but managed to retain the power of a lesser deity. Following Vecna's defeat, the Lady of Pain strengthened Sigil's defenses and reorganized the planar structure in order to repair the damage caused and to prevent such an event from ever happening again.
