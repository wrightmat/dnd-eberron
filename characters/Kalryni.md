A swift blue dragon, Kalryni is an incredibly powerful arial tactician. She possesses a powerful pair of wings that are rumored to create gusts that flattened forests and upturned tectonic plates. While much of this is likely hyperbole, there is no doubting that her speed is unmatched. Kalryniâ€™s color is fresh and lovely, a pale azure blue like the sky at dawn.

Kalryni has rarely seen humanoids, so she finds any encounters with them fascinating. She asks every question that pops into her head, from dietary requirements to mating rituals, and seems delighted at any response. Her attention is both flattering and dangerous, however; the curious dragon sees nothing wrong with slicing open a non-dragon for dissection purposes if his comments intrigue her.
