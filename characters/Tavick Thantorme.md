Tavick Thantorme is a current Friar of the [[Church of the Silver Flame]], and former traumatized soldier and Companion-At-Arms for Onme (now the Keeper of the Flame). His adventures began when he experienced an attack on the Cathedral of the Silver Flame by a Tarnished Templar, and then reluctantly accompanied an adventuring party to take her on. After the battle concluded, Tavick decided to remain with the adventuring party, traveling across Eberron and eventually into wildspace.

At the age of 24, Tavick served as the Quartermaster on the first spelljamming ship, the New Dawn. He was known at that time to be bad at both cooking and motivating, and spend much of his time attending to Onme's horses.

Upon the party's return to Eberron, Onme sponsored Tavick's application into the Psalm of the Flame Seminary in Flamekeep, testifying that he served under her and learned the basics of the faith sufficient to enter seminary. He took to the structure of seminary well, and graduated in four years, joining the Order of Friars. Immediately after graduation, he was sent to help establish a new church in an abandoned fort in a remote area of Karrnath known as Lakeside, based on a tip from a templar many years ago.

After several years spent in Karrnath, Tavick left to commence the true mission of the Order of Friars, wandering the world and spreading the light of faith.
