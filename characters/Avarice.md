Avarice is a cruel and vindictive tiefling trained in the arcane tradition of evocation. She likes using her magic to destroy things, and her hunger for magic items knows no bounds. Her supreme confidence means that she never backs down from a challenge, even when the odds are clearly stacked against her. Seeing other wizards as a threat, paranoia rules her life.

The tiefling has the secret support of the overlord Dral Khatuur, having traded her soul years ago for her first taste of magical power. Dral Khatuur speaks to her in dreams and guides her path. Shortly after Avarice arrived in Icerazer, Dral Khatuur urged her to seek out the Ivory Scale. Avarice didn’t know who or what the Ivory Scale was until she was approached by a gruop of cultists bearing white scale-like pendants around their necks. These members of the Order of the Ivory Scale offered her sanctuary in their hall. Although she doesn’t trust the Order, they treat her with more respect than anyone else does, and the keep is a safer location than most other places in the Frostfell.

**Companions**. Avarice has a pair of loyal gargoyles named Gargle and Gurgle who serve her as bodyguards and scouts. Avarice uses her Rary’s telepathic bond spell to stay in telepathic contact with her gargoyles before sending them off on any mission. Avarice also has the support of the Order of the Ivory Scale, if she needs to call on their talents.

**Familiar**. Avarice’s familiar throughout the adventure is a squawking raven named Skelm. It uses the raven stat block in the Monster Manual but is a fiend instead of a beast.

**Spellbook**. Avarice’s spellbook has white leather covers and vellum pages. The tiefling’s personal sigil is burned into the front cover. The book contains the spells Avarice has prepared plus the following additional spells: [[burning hands]], [[cone of cold]], [[find familiar]], [[ice storm]], [[lightning bolt]], [[rope trick]], [[thunderwave]], [[tongues]], [[wall of fire]], and [[wall of force]].

### Development

When the party encountered her in the Frostfell, they were robbed by Avarice. Verity robbed of gold, and Thana of her Undying Court broach.

Avarice was commissioned by Garrick Quickfinder in Frostmantle to get back his Bag of Holding that the Verity took. She lies in wait for them outside of the Mournland. She has gained a companion since their last encounter.
- **[[Victory Graves]]** (female human thief). Vic also answered Garrick's job posting to get the stolen Bag of Holding back, but she and Avarice hit it off with their similarities and they decided to join forces. Use the stat block from Flee, Mortals!, page 377.

Next time the players encounter Avarice, depending on how this encounter goes, she should have another member in her party.
- **[[Jutkarr Flintfingers]]** (male dwarf thief). Jutkarr responded to the sale of the Orb of Dragonkind that Avarice put out, but he and Avarice hit it off and they instead hatched a plan and decided to join forces. Use the stat block from Flee, Mortals!, page 376, with Amethyst Die added to him instead of Harlo.
