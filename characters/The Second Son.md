The Second Son is the jealous heir who stands just beyond the claim to a title. He is always scheming to usurp power or steal the things that belong to others. In most tales, his gambits ultimately end in failure, further driving his bitterness. His formal title in the Moon Court is the Count of the Barren Marches, as his lands are always inferior to those of his siblings.
