>"I demonstrate my brilliance through the cruel subtlety of my actions."

Moar’donn hatched in a lizardfolk encampment in Q’barra; how the reptilians acquired his egg, the dragon doesn’t know. Unlike their more civilized cousins, these savage lizardfolk enslaved and tormented the black wyrmling. In time, Moar’donn grew powerful enough to escape from his captors. Now only bitterness and rage lives in his heart. He ruthlessly destroys all non-dragons who cross his path.
