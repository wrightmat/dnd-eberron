 #npc 

Whether helping students with interpersonal problems or picking their college, Mavinda is at the ready with wise words and a comforting wing.

Although she comes across as peaceful and understanding, Mavinda should not be underestimated. As an employee of Strixhaven, she is a powerful mage in her own right and wields powerful empathic magic. While she normally uses that magic to calm her students and better understand their feelings, she is capable of summoning more debilitating emotions in a pinch.

**Voice**: Medium-pitched, Medium-paced, Warm (friendly, inviting), Drawn-out vowels (elongated sounds, e.g., 'weeeeell...'), Cheerful (smiles, laughs often).
