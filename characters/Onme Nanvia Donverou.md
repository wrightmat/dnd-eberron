Trained as a Templar of the Silver Flame, where she began her training at the age of 16 after being sent there from the orphanage (since she wasn't adopted). Onme is originally from Thrane, where she was raised in an orphanage in Daskaran, but was recruited into the [[Church of the Silver Flame]] at the earliest possible age.

### Development

* In Lharvion 998 YK, she was promoted to Knight Lieutenant by Jaela Daran herself, in recognition of her service to the Church of the Silver Flame in neutralizing the Tarnished Templar threat.
* In Zarantyr 999 YK, she was promoted to Knight Captain by Jaela, due to the information she passed on to the church concerning Project Siberys and House Cannith's use of Dolurrh souls in Warforged. She was given authority over all church matters in the "up".
* Onme had many adventures in wildspace with her group on board the New Dawn, as she continued to train her companion-at-arms, Tavick. At the conclusion of those adventures, she decided to return to Eberron, where she was promoted to Knight Major and sponsored Tavick's admission into seminary. She then returned to wildspace aboard Tira's Sacrifice, the Church of the Silver Flame's first shardjammer, along with her best friend Spiney who served as captain.
* Eventually Onme returned to Eberron after many years exploring Wildspace on Tira's Sacrifice, and establishing a permanent base on the Ring of Siberys. For these actions, she was promoted one last time to Knight Commander. Her best friend Spiney ([[Spindelaryx]]) was promoted as well (to Prefect) and given domain over all of Thrane, using this power to further elevate Onme in the church.
* In 1051 YK, Jaela Daran passed away, and Onme was selected as the new Keeper of the Flame (due to her Aasimar heritage, her position in the church, her close relationship with Jaela, and her history of visions).
