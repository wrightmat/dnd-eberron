Valmoc is a silver dragonborn who serves as a sort of emissary for the silver dragons and the Silver Scales organization more generally. He's sort of the opposite of a mercenary - someone who is hired to protect others. The party will encounter him somewhere as they travel, as a means to learn about the Paladin Protectors of the Realm.

Valmoc embodies the stoicism and discipline associated with his dragonborn heritage. He speaks in measured tones, revealing little about himself or his true intentions. He is unyielding in his commitment to the party's protection, even if it means keeping them in the dark about the true extent of their significance.

Mysterious and enigmatic, Valmoc enjoys playing with the perceptions of those around him. He appears and disappears without warning, leaving the party to question his motives. Valmoc's loyalty lies not only with the party but also with the greater purpose dictated by his patron. His actions are calculated, and he carefully selects the information he shares, maintaining an air of secrecy that only deepens as the party learns about the nefarious deeds of other dragon tribes.

As the party unravels the complex web of dragon politics and threats to the realm, Valmoc's role becomes increasingly vital. The challenge for the party is to decide whether they can trust this silver-scaled guardian or if his mysterious nature poses a threat of its own.

### History

* His mother (Agrelia) and father (Clarion) brought him to Khorvaire as a child, from The Tapestry in Argonnessen. They were sent by The Chamber to start an organization to be known as The Silver Scales.
* They ran into some trouble with the law in setting things up, and his father was sent to prison by the Sharn Watch. When Valmoc was an older teenager, after many years of trying to get him out through legitimate means, his mother brought draconic re-enforcements and tried to break his father out of prison, and was killed in the process. The silver wyrmlings that she had brought with her wiped out the Sharn Watch, but it was soon discovered that Valmoc's father was nowhere to be found.
* A female silver dragon named Yllosavax stepped up and took over the Silver Scales from his mother, using her diplomatic skills and desire for harmony between the two groups to smooth out relations between the city and the dragons (while also re-staffing the Sharn Watch with her own silver dragons in disguise).
* Valmoc himself left, and decided to enroll in classes at Morgrave University. Throughout his time there, he became close with Flamewind, who became almost like a new mother to him. Eventually when he graduated and returned to the Silver Scales as an agent, she would often reach out and hire him for important jobs.

### Development

Valmoc was introduced to the group when Aither spotted him following them in a crowd on their way to the lightning rail station. She confronted him, and he only told them that he was paid to watch over them and that he couldn't tell them by whom ("I'm not at liberty to say"). The group posited that he was a cop. He traveled in the same lightning rail car as them to Thrane.
