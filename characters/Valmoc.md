Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Traveling Guardian (for hire)
Race:: Dragonborn

Valmoc is a silver dragonborn who serves as a sort of emissary for the silver dragons and the Silver Scales organization more generally. He's sort of the opposite of a mercenary - someone who is hired to protect others. The party will encounter him somewhere as they travel, as a means to learn about the Paladin Protectors of the Realm.

Valmoc embodies the stoicism and discipline associated with his dragonborn heritage. He speaks in measured tones, revealing little about himself or his true intentions. He is unyielding in his commitment to the party's protection, even if it means keeping them in the dark about the true extent of their significance.

Mysterious and enigmatic, Valmoc enjoys playing with the perceptions of those around him. He appears and disappears without warning, leaving the party to question his motives. Valmoc's loyalty lies not only with the party but also with the greater purpose dictated by his patron. His actions are calculated, and he carefully selects the information he shares, maintaining an air of secrecy that only deepens as the party learns about the nefarious deeds of other dragon tribes.

As the party unravels the complex web of dragon politics and threats to the realm, Valmoc's role becomes increasingly vital. The challenge for the party is to decide whether they can trust this silver-scaled guardian or if his mysterious nature poses a threat of its own.

### Development

Valmoc was introduced to the group when Aither spotted him following them in a crowd on their way to the lightning rail station. She confronted him, and he only told them that he was paid to watch over them and that he couldn't tell them by whom ("I'm not at liberty to say"). The group posited that he was a cop. He traveled in the same lightning rail car as them to Thrane.
