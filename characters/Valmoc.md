Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Traveling Guardian (for hire)
Race:: Dragonborn

Valmoc is a silver dragonborn who serves as a sort of emissary for the silver dragons and the Silver Scale organization more generally. He's sort of the opposite of a mercenary - someone who is hired to protect others. The PCs will encounter him somewhere as they travel, as a means to learn about the Paladin Protectors of the Realm.

### Development

Valmoc was introduced to the group when Aither spotted him following them in a crowd on their way to the lightning rail station. She confronted him, and he only told them that he was paid to watch over them and that he couldn't tell them by whom ("I'm not at liberty to say"). The group posited that he was a cop. He traveled in the same lightning rail car as them to Thrane.
