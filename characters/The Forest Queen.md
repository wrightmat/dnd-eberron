The Forest Queen reflects the mystery and danger of the dark woods. She is protective of her beasts and despises the encroaching cities. In her tales, she rewards those who respect the wilds and show kindness to her beasts, but she is cruel to fools who stray from the path or hurt her subjects.

Regardless of origin, any character allied with the Forest Queen is expected to follow her rules:

- Don’t use weapons or armor of metal.
- Don’t kill a natural beast with magic or for sport.
- Protect those who travel on a marked path, unless they harm the forest with their actions.
- Help any fey of the forest who comes to you in need.
