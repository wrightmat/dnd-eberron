Windsor was born in Sharn, and his parents (Tourmaline and Vernon still live in the Oakbridge neighborhood of the Middle Northedge district. They run an art restoration shop in North Towers (Lower Central).

Windsor attended school at Arcanix for 6 years, pursing the equivalent of a Masters degree, and then spent several years working at the library before setting out on his own. When Windsor met the adventuring party in 998 YK, he still held debt that he's trying to pay off, even after his parents' contribution and his working afterward.
 * Calculated Arcanix tuition as 2 gp/day x 350 days (365 days a year, minus holidays) = 700 gp per year x 6 years = 4200 gp total. Had 1400 gp left when the adventure started in Nymm 998 YK.
 * Paid off the debt in Rhaan 998 YK, thanks to a substantial gift from Bystan, after Windsor saved his life. He sent the money off to the school via House Kundarak.

Windsor’s favorite bookshop is in North Towers (Lower Central) near his parents’ shop, where he would secretly purchase trashy romance novels - his guilty pleasure.

### Family

Windsor's parents are Vernon (father) and Tourmaline (mother) Stone, who work as art restorers in Sharn.

They have the common personality traits of kind parents. Neither of his parents are the type to raise their voices. The only thing is that they share Windsor's overthinking patterns and worry about him quite a bit. His father's side of the family is the origin of the art restoration/conservation business but both parents contribute to the business. Windsor is familiar with the baseline procedures behind the work but doesn't consider himself professional level like his parents. They'll both be happy to see Astra because they know Windsor is introverted at times so it's rare for them to meet new friends of his.

They are also quite nosey, which is what contributed to Windsor’s anxiety.

### Development

* Windsor and Astra went on their first date in Sharn in Sypheros 998 YK (when they returned to the city to break the news of their coming space adventures to his parents), where Windsor showed them several of his favorite places in Sharn. Astra also got a copy of a baby picture showing Windsor in a sailor outfit from Tourmaline.
* Windsor and Astra officially started dating in 999 YK, during their 9 months around the world.
* Windsor and the rest of their group left for wildspace ("The Up") aboard a ship called the New Dawn. After that adventure was completed, Windsor returned to Eberron with Astra to settle down. Astra took him back to Adar, to their favorite clifftop at dawn, and proposed marriage. The two were married in Sharn, and settled down in Arcanix where Windsor returned to his academic life. After many years, after Windsor had mostly retired, they moved to Stormhome to spend their old age on the beaches.
