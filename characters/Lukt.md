Originally an NPC played by [[Alex Kelsch]] during [[3-03. The Orphanage Flashback]]

Lukt was raised in an orphanage in Daskaran with several other orphans, where he had an adventure with a tiger at a young age. Several years later, he was taken from the orphanage to Flamekeep to train as a Paladin of the Silver Flame. After several years of training, Lukt was transferred with a small group of other new Paladins to Rekkenmark to participate in a special military training class. While there, Lukt was visited by a rakshasa named Kashtarhak, who he was intrigued by since he'd never seen a tiger creature like this before. Kashtarhak slowly corrupted Lukt over the course of his time at Rekkenmark, encouraging him to turn toward the overlord Eldrantulku and eventually break his oath with the Silver Flame. Lukt snuck away from Rekkenmark in the night, and traveled to the nearby city of [[Korth]].
