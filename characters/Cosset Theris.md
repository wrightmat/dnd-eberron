- Originally created as a nanny for a wizard's children in Cyre, before the Day of Mourning.
- Was being repaired during the Day of Mourning, and woke up to find everyone dead. Took on the family name and decided to attend Strixhaven in place of the children who were supposed to go.

### Motivation and Goal(s)

- Find an answer about what happened to the children, or at very least find a purpose.
- She's lost right now, and just following in their footsteps looking for answers.
