 #npc [[Delethorn]]

A half-orc private investigator, adventurer, and bounty hunter who has claimed the ancient sewers running under the sewers of Delethorn in the name of the Finders Guild. He lives on the edge of town, and mostly keeps to himself. He has a deep, slow, abbreviated voice, with many monosyllabic utterances.
