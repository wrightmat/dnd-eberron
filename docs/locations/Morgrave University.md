 #location [[Sharn]] [[Upper Menthis Plateau]]

Morgrave University is an institution of higher learning in Sharn, Breland. While not the most reputable university academically speaking, it has made great gains in research regarding the continent of Xen'drik, mostly by funding expeditions of Wayfinders and adventurers, who bring back artifacts and information to fill the university's museums and libraries.

The university was founded by Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave in 738 YK to be a "beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city, illuminating the forgotten secrets of the past." The current Master of Morgrave University is Larrian ir'Morgrave, the oldest heir of the Morgrave line. Larrian has spent decades studying the civilizations of ancient Xen'drik.

The university's main campus lies in the University District of Upper Menthis in Sharn.

Morgrave University is not the most reputable institution in Khorvaire. It lacks the resources of the Library of Korranberg or Wynarn University, and many claim that its archaeological activities are infested with smugglers and treasure hunters. While the university lacks the clout of its peers in Korranberg and Aundair, it is much more accessible to young adventurers who have yet to build a reputation.
