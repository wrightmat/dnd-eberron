 #location #region [[Sarlona]]

Adar is the mountainous region in southeast of Sarlona. It is inhabited mostly by humans (including the kalashtar), though there is a prominent contingent of blue dragons on the uppermost peaks.

To its inhabitants, Adar is mostly known as a refuge from the dictatorship of Riedra, and many of its residents can trace their lineage to refugees and dissidents of the Riedran state. To this day, Riedra considers Adar a danger to its enforced stability, and regularly sends troops to attack the borders of the region.

The region of Adar covers the southeastern tip of Sarlona. The region is defined by tall mountains, cliffs, and plateaus, with the majority of the land being over 12,000 feet in elevation. This includes the mountain of Korrandar, one of the tallest mountains in all of Eberron.

About 20% of the region is arable land, mainly in the valleys between the mountains. The region has a number of manifest zones to Lamannia and Kythri, the largest being Ahdryatmin in the center of Adar.

### Religion and Culture

Traditional Adaran prayers call on Braahyn (Balinor), the god of the wi lds and the moving earth, and his spouse Aarakti (Arawai), the goddess of abundance and storms. Many people also respect the spirits of nature and those of their ancestors.

### Art and Architecture

Adaran art is more craft than fine art. From carved knife grips to chanted meditation verses, art in Adar often serves a dual purpose. It's also very personal.

Buildings in Adar are made out of stone, with wood used for roofs. Built to withstand the wind, precipitation, and trembling earth, houses are usually broad and low with sharply slanted sides. To an Aundairian, Adaran living spaces would seem cramped, but a native of Adar values a house that lasts more than she does a high ceiling. Adarans take care and time to personalize their dwellings — an Adaran might spend years carving designs into the walls of her home.
Most houses have a central opening in the roof with another smaller roof built over it, like a small tower. Such openings allow light in and stale air out.

### Food and Fashion

Food holds a special place in Adaran life. It is a requirement for life, but it is also a mode of expression, a blessing from the spirit world, and an experience. An Adaran avoids cooking and eating when he is angry or grieving, lest his emotions taint the meal.
Food is usually baked in or roasted on a clay oven built in the house, though broiling over an open fire is a common alternative. Adarans avoid using utensils. They use their hands, sometimes protected by leaves, to pick up food, intending to involve all five senses in eating.
Adarans like spice. The fragrant herbs used in cooking provide taste, and many also aid digestion and fortify the body. Foreigners can find Adaran food too spicy, and Adarans often find foreign food bland.

Adarans wear loose and comfortable clothes including simple sandals when it's warm. In the cold, they layer in cloth and fur. As with all their crafts, they take the time to decorate their clothes — leather and cloth are often richly colored, and patterns of elaborate lines are woven or painted as highlights. Bright colors in individualized patterns often make it possible to tell who's coming down the ridge before that person's face can be recognized.
Skin is a place for adornment as well. Intricate, temporary body art made with herbs provides a way to focus the mind while allowing one to share the results. Herbal paints or powders are also applied to indicate a spiritual or emotional condition or event, such as yellow for happiness or ash-gray for grief.

### What Do You Know?

**Intelligence (History)**

DC 12: Adar is a place full of strange magic. The greatest custodians of lore in the mountains are known as the Keepers of the Word.

DC 15: The leader of the Keepers of the Word is called the Speaker of the Word, and this person holds great sway in Adar. But Adar has many other magical traditions.

DC 18: Adarans believe dragons created their land, and the great mountains there harbor dragons and dragon ruins. The greatest among these are the legendary Storm Guardians who guard the mountain Korrandar.

**Intelligence (Nature)**

DC 10: Kalashtar come from the insular nation of Adar, which is in southern Sarlona.

DC 12: Adar is a mountainous region troubled by terrible storms. It has been under siege by Riedra for centuries.

DC 15: Climate in Adar varies by altitude—valleys can be tropical and extremely fertile while peaks are blasted by glacial winds. Adar's storms aren't altogether natural. Its mightiest mountains, the highest of which is called Korrandar, are blanketed in constant storm clouds.

DC 18: Adarans are a mixed bunch. Some of them are mountainfolk, while others are monks, magicians, and exiles. Many of these strange folk came to Adar during Sarlona's war- torn past. Most of them live in one of Adar' s eight major settlements all of which are monasti c fortresses carved into the mountains.

**Intelligence (Arcana)**

DC 15: Some great magic prevents all dimensional travel into and within Adar.

DC 18: This "magic" is actually a psionic shroud that envelops the country and originates from the temple-fortresses of Adar.

DC 20: Adar has many manifest zones connected to Lamannia, explaining its supernaturally wild territories. It also has some manifest zones to Kythri. The interaction of these forces might explain some of the storms that rage in the land.

### Five Things Every Adaran Knows

1. **The legend of Taratai.** Taratai was the mysterious spirit that led other spirits into Adar to create the kalashtar, and teach the Path of Light. She is a holy mother, a guide, and a warrior. Everyone knows of her sacrifice, and many people in Adar set aside five days of winter to mourn her passing. This "holiday" is called the Void of Taratai.
2. **The dragons created Adar**. Adar is an unnatural amalgam of mountains and storms. The dragons and couatls created the place to make it impossible to get to an evil that sleeps beneath the land. Draconic magic still calls to the unique and the wild to come to Adar and protect it. The Storm Guardians who rule mysterious Korrandar are proof.
3. **Some martial arts.** Many people in Adar know a few dance steps from the path of shadows or a formalized routine from a nearby monastery. Most practice these forms as morning exercise and meditation, and many of them actually know how to fight.
4. **Actions mean more than words.** Whether it's meditation on the Path of Light, stalking and killing a mountain lion that's been eating livestock, or just planting your barley on time, doing something is better than talking or vacillation. In fact, one of the precepts of the Path of Light is that the worst action to take is no action at all.
5. **Death is not the end.** Adherents of the Path of Light believe that nothing in the world or on any plane is eternal. Dolurrh is a place where the ego dies, but the spirit is immortal, and it returns to the Material Plane again and again. The goal of living is eventually to master the Path of Light, thereby transcending fear and false desires. Those who accomplish this become one with il-Yannah.
