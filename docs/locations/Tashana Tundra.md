The Tashana Tundra is a land of vast, open spaces and endless sky. Home to the great shifter nation of Sarlona, the Tundra consists mainly of grassy, treeless plains that stretch without interruption from horizon to horizon. For many thousands of years, these semi-nomadic tribes have roamed the grasslands, isolated from the rest of the world and left in relative peace to contemplate the cold, pure spirit of their ancestral homeland.

### Land of Many Waters

Tashana means "many waters" in an ancient, nearly extinct shifter dialect. The plains are dotted with hundreds, if not thousands, of small glacial lakes. Many of these remain frozen year-round, but the southern waters thaw in summer. In these months, the Tundra is a place of pure and unspoiled natural beauty. The landscapes are regularly interrupted by huge mounds of rocks and boulders, some miles wide, that seem to have fallen from the sky. Remnants, presumably, of an earlier glacial age, these rock mounds have a strange and otherworldly beauty.

The majority of the Tundra is covered with frosty grasslands. To the north the Eska Mountains rise, and the northern foothills of the Paqaa Mountains encroach upon the southern border. In the far north, the dream-like and ghostly Tashyvar Islands reach into the Sea of Rage. Finally, the mysterious Krertok Peninsula extends northeast of the Eska Spines.

The climate is mainly subarctic, with true arctic conditions in the northern plains and mountains, and short summer months of near-temperate conditions in the south. If anything definitive can be said of the Tundra as a whole, it is this â€” it is a land of strange weather. Blizzards, snow squalls, and whiteouts sometimes descend in an instant, but also common are strange heat waves, downpours of inexplicably warm rain, and savage lightning strikes.

### Planar Elements

The southern border of the Tashana region is marked by a gradual elevation shift and what appears to be an intermittent manifest zone tied to Risia, the Plane of Ice. All along these border lands, planar manifestations of ice and snow have given the appearance of a land of per petual wi nter to
those south of the border. Thi s geogr aphi cal isolation
has resulted in a land that is remarkably i nsular and
self- sustaining.
The Tundra is well known for reality storms (aukaraks
in the ancient Shifter dialect), rogue planar breaches and
manifest zones that drift over the landscape.
GETTING THERE
Although no more difficult to travel to than other locales,

the Tashana Tundra had few visitors in the past. The aus-
tere beauty of the place and its peoples drew little interest.

Recently, however, things have changed.
