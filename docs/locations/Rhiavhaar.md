The people of Rhiavhaar have always been the finest shipwrights and sailors of Sarlona; but they weren’t simply merchants or fisherfolk. Long before their descendants settled the Lhazaar Principalities—named after the notorious Rhiavhaarian explorer—they were known for their piracy. In general, Rhiavhaarians were seen as wild, capricious, and dangerous; “Rhiavhaarian luck” was a common curse suggesting that fortune favors a scoundrel.
