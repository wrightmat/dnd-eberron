 #location #continent [[Eberron]]

Sarlona is the ancestral home of the human race. Run as an almost totalitarian regime by The Unity of Reidra through the entirety of the Age of the Dreaming Dark, the entire continent changed when Reidra fell after the Turning of the Age in 1000 YK. The power vacuum created caused the continent to revert to a structure similar to what existed prior to The Unity - a coalition of Ten Nations.

### Ten Nations

The Capital of the Ten Nations is the city of Kasshta (formerly Kasshta Keep) in Adar. The nations below are presented in descending order of approximate population (with Syrkarn being the most populace).

##### Syrkarn

Syrkarn is a southern nation on the continent of Sarlona. It is a mostly agrarian society made up of ogres, eneko ("mongrel ogres"), half-giants, and humans. During the Age of the Dreaming Dark, Syrkarn sat on the edge of Reidran territory but was effectively independent. Because of this, it was barely effected by the Turning of the Age, and has grown to be the largest nation in the new continent of Sarlona. Its growth has also been impacted by the nearby ports on the Aventus Islands who take people in from other continents such as Khorvaire and Aerenal. The nation remains fiercely independent though, and had little interest in becoming the capital of the newly established Ten Nations, which it happily passed to Adar. Syrkarn does remain the bread basket for the entire continent of Sarlona.

##### Adar

Adar is the mountainous nation in the southeast of Sarlona. It is inhabited mostly by humans (including the kalashtar), though there is a prominent contingent of blue dragons on the uppermost peaks. Adar was mostly a refuge from the Inspired during the Age of the Dreaming Dark, and has now become one of the largest nations on Sarlona, the largest majority Human nation, and the capital of the Ten Nations. Kasshta Keep, with its deep history and proximity to the border with Syrkarn, has become the capital city of Adar and the broader Ten Nations.

##### Rhiavhaar

This coastal nation is the homeland of Lhazaar and includes important ports like Dar Ulatesh, the major western port with voyages to Khorvaire.

##### Pyrine

Thought by many to be the source of worship of the Sovereign Host, this province turned wholeheartedly to worship of the Inspired during the last Age. Pyrine's Sovereign Host history has mostly reasserted itself now, and it is the seat of religion on the continent.

##### Borunan

The nation of Borunan was once a strong nation of ogres, which became tools of the Inspired during the Age of the Dreaming Dark. But now that powerful race and the ogre mage lords that rule them are able to walk their own path once again.

##### Corvagura

The most populous of Riedra's provinces, Corvagura was once the seat of The Unity, and has therefore had the hardest time recovering from the Turning of the Age. The cities of Corvagura, nestled among the wet southern jungles, have been slowly rebuilding but will likely never return to their former splendor.

##### Dor Maleer

The northern province of Dor Maleer is the most independent, inhabited by woodsmen and hardy folk who barely noticed that The Unity existed or has since fallen.

##### Ohr Kaluun

Before Unification, the arcanists of the eastern islands were powerful but they too fell to the Inspired. A legacy remained during the Age of the Dreaming Dark but it was hidden in shadows and practiced by criminals. This arcane knowledge has become more prevalent and out in the open since the Turning, but the criminal element certainly remains.

##### Nulakesh

Nulakesh was once a large empire in central Sarlona dominated by human overlords, and that legacy led to one of the most intolerant provinces during the Age of the Dreaming Dark. Unfortunately, not much improved when the Turning of the Age happened, as while the Inspired were no longer in charge, the Humans took over with their own form of very similar intolerance.

##### Khalesh

The ancient nation of Khalesh was a theocracy devoted to the couatls. Today, the people know only that the land was once ruled by demons and their ruins still dot the landscape.
