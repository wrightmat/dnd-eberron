 #location #continent [[Eberron]]

Sarlona is the ancestral home of the human race. Run as an almost totalitarian regime by The Unity of Riedra through the entirety of the Age of the Dreaming Dark, the entire continent changed when Riedra fell after the Turning of the Age (also known as the Second Sundering) in 1000 YK. The power vacuum created caused the continent to revert to a structure similar to what existed prior to The Unity - a coalition of Ten Kingdoms.

### Excerpts from Secrets of Sarlona

* Precariously balanced among the planes, Sarlona has many wild zones and reality storms. These phenomena produce creatures and effects unseen elsewhere in the world. A few veins of Khyber shards exist on the continent, largely in the hands of the dromites. Defying any logic, however, Eberron dragonshards simply do not form on Sarlona. Similarly, Siberys shards aren't found in equatorial Sarlona at all.
* Sarlona was the birthplace of humanity, and today humans make up the vast majority of the dragonmarked population, but no dragonmarks have ever appeared on the people of Sarlona. Early signs indicate that the children of dragonmarked parents don't develop dragonmarks if they are conceived in Sarlona. The Twelve has no explanation for this phenomenon, but many believe that it is one of the keys to the ultimate mystery of the dragonmarks and their purpose in the world.
* The lack of dragonmarks mirrors Sarlona's absence from the Draconic Prophecy. The few human scholars and cataclysm mages who have been able to discuss the Prophecy with the scaled lords of Argonnessen have found the dragons to be utterly unwilling to speak of Sarlona. Some believe that this is because the dragons know of an inescapable catastrophe destined to originate from the continent. But others have a more disturbing theory. They claim that the dragons don't speak of Sarlona because the continent and the events that transpire there are completely invisible to the Prophecy, and this terrifies the dragons. Whatever the cause, the dragons clearly shun this land.
* Of all the human history of Sarlona, one critical piece is known not because the Sarlonans kept a record of it, but because of its lasting repercussions beyond that land. Some three thousand years before the present age, a flotilla of ships left the land even then called Rhiavhaar, bound west across the Sea of Rage. The leader of this exodus was an explorer named Lhazaar. Though many Khorvairian humans are unaware that Lhazaar's expedition was the beginning of human society on Khorvaire, all know her name.

### Ten Kingdoms

The Capital of the Ten Kingdoms is the city of Kasshta (formerly Kasshta Keep) in Adar. The kingdoms below are presented in descending order of approximate population (with Syrkarn being the most populace).

##### [[Syrkarn]]
Syrkarn is a southern nation on the continent of Sarlona. It is a mostly agrarian society made up of ogres, eneko ("mongrel ogres"), half-giants, and humans. During the Age of the Dreaming Dark, Syrkarn sat on the edge of Reidran territory but was effectively independent. Because of this, it was barely effected by the Second Sundering, and has grown to be the largest nation in the new continent of Sarlona. Its growth has also been impacted by the nearby ports on the Aventus Islands who take people in from other continents such as Khorvaire and Aerenal. The nation remains fiercely independent though, and had little interest in becoming the capital of the newly established Ten Kingdoms, which it happily passed to Adar. Syrkarn does remain the bread basket for the entire continent of Sarlona.

* Population: 4,260,000 (44% human, 42% eneko, 12% half-giant, 1% kalashtar, 1% other)
* Environments: Arid steppes, deserts, and savannahs, occasionally broken up by hills and mountains
* Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Fernia, Risia, and especially Lamannia
* Major Settlements: Nderitese, Per, Gjitha, Maszani, Ardhmen

##### [[Adar]]
Adar is the mountainous nation in the southeast of Sarlona. It is inhabited mostly by humans (including the kalashtar), though there is a prominent contingent of blue dragons on the uppermost peaks. Adar was mostly a refuge from the Inspired during the Age of the Dreaming Dark, and has now become one of the largest nations on Sarlona, the largest majority Human nation, and the capital of the Ten Kingdoms. Kasshta, with its deep history and proximity to the border with Syrkarn, has become the capital city of Adar and the broader Ten Kingdoms.

* Population: 2,320,000 (51% human, 45% kalashtar, 4% other)
* Environments: Temperate with warm lowlands and cold highlands
* Planar Elements: Many manifest zones to Lamannia and Kythri
* Major Settlements: Kasshta, Dvaarnava, Haztaratain Monastery, Malshashar, Tashalatora, Xephanan, Zi'til'natek

##### [[Rhiavhaar]]
The people of Rhiavhaar have always been the finest shipwrights and sailors of Sarlona; but they weren’t simply merchants or fisherfolk. Long before their descendants settled the Lhazaar Principalities — named after the notorious Rhiavhaarian explorer — they were known for their piracy. In general, Rhiavhaarians are still seen as wild, capricious, and dangerous; “Rhiavhaarian luck” is a common curse suggesting that fortune favors a scoundrel.

* Population: 2,260,000 (85% humans, 6% shifters, 4% changelings, 3% ogres/ogre mages, 2% other)
* Environments: Temperate plains and marsh
* Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Lamannia, Shavarath, and Thelanis
* Major Settlements: Dul Jhaar, Dar Ulatesh

##### [[Pyrine]]
Thought by many to be the source of worship of the Sovereign Host, this province turned wholeheartedly to worship of the Inspired during the last Age. Pyrine's Sovereign Host history has mostly reasserted itself now, and it is the seat of religion on the continent. Pyrine is a land of warm plains and forests, welcoming both in its aspect and its aura. Something about Pyrine inspires calm reflection. When standing in a Pyrinean meadow, it's easy to feel a sense of joy and contentment — to know that somehow, all is right in the world.

* Population: 2,100,000 (93% humans, 3% shifters, 2% changelings, 2% other)
* Environments: Warm and temperate plains, forests, and marshes
* Planar Elements: Wild zones tied to Daanvi, Irian, and Syrania
* Major Settlements: Dul Zeer, Dul El, Dar Ilash, Dul Durat

##### [[Nulakesh]]
Nulakesh was once a large empire in central Sarlona dominated by human overlords, and that legacy led to one of the most intolerant provinces during the Age of the Dreaming Dark. Unfortunately, not much improved when the Turning of the Age happened, as while the Inspired were no longer in charge, the Humans took over with their own form of very similar intolerance. Rumors persist that something akin to The Unity may still exist in some capacity in Nulakesh.

* Population: 1,100,000 (93% humans, 3% Chosen/Inspired, 2% changelings, 2% other)
* Environments: Temperate and cold plains, forests, and mountains
* Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Daanvi, Dolurrh, and Shavarath
* Major Settlements: Dul Natath, Dar Terash, Dul Zerath, Dar Darath, Dar Reth

##### [[Borunan]]
The nation of Borunan was once a strong nation of ogres, which became tools of the Inspired during the Age of the Dreaming Dark. But now that powerful race and the ogre mage lords that rule them are able to walk their own path once again. The people of Borunan tend to be cheerful and straightforward. Feats of strength are admired; a human isn't expected to match an ogre but still earns respect for proving his prowess. Athletic events typically include weightlifting and throwing contests.

* Population: 496,000 (80% ogres, 8% humans, 5% ogre mages, 3% shifters, 2% half-giants, 2% other)
* Environments: Warm desert, temperate mountains
* Planar Elements: High concentration of wild zones linked to Fernia and Shavarath
* Major Settlements: Mokush (an ogre village)

##### [[Corvagura]]
The most populous of former Riedra's provinces, Corvagura was once the seat of The Unity (with the capital at Durat Tal), and has therefore had the hardest time recovering from the Second Sundering. The cities of Corvagura, nestled among the wet southern jungles, have been slowly rebuilding but will likely never return to their former splendor.

* Population: 440,000 (91% humans, 4% shifters, 3% changelings, 1% ogres/ogre mages, 1% other)
* Environments: Warm plains, marshes, and forests
* Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Mabar, Lamannia, and Thelanis
* Major Settlements: Dar Jin, Dar Myan, Durat Tal

##### [[Dor Maleer]]
The northern province of Dor Maleer is the most independent, inhabited by woodsmen and hardy folk who barely noticed that The Unity existed or has since fallen. Dor Maleer shares a border with the Tashana Tundra — a border that has been slowly shifting north over the centuries.

* Population: 380,000 (73% humans, 15% shifters, 4% changelings, 3% ogres/ogre mages, 3% dwarves, 2% other)
* Environments: Cold deserts, mountains, and plains
* Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Dolurrh, Lamannia, and Risia
* Major Settlements: Dar Vuleer

##### [[Ohr Kaluun]]
Before Unification, the arcanists of the eastern islands were powerful but they too fell to the Inspired. A legacy remained during the Age of the Dreaming Dark but it was hidden in shadows and practiced by criminals. This arcane knowledge has become more prevalent and out in the open since the Second Sundering, but the criminal element certainly remains.

* Population: 72,000 (67% humans, 12% skulks, 8% changelings, 5% shifters, 5% dwarves, 2% ogres/ogre mages, 1% other)
* Environments: Temperate plains and hills
* Planar Elements: Wild zones linked to Mabar, Xoriat, and Kythri
* Major Settlements: Dar Kel

##### [[Khalesh]]
Khalesh is a land of temperate plains and desert — green grassland fading into sunbaked plains and mesas. While it’s more hospitable than neighboring Borunan, at a glance it’s rather barren — endless and empty. And yet, if you wander these plains, you may find yourself enveloped by a sense of well-being, a deep-rooted optimism, and the knowledge that all will be well … with an underlying conviction that you’ll fight to keep it that way. The ancient nation of Khalesh was a theocracy devoted to the couatls. Today, the people know only that the land was once ruled by demons and their ruins still dot the landscape.

* Population: 50,000 (90% humans, 3% shifters, 4% changelings, 2% ogres/ogre mages, 1% other)
* Environments: Temperate plains and desert
* Planar Elements: Couatl shrines and ruins; wild zones linked to Irian, Shavarath, and Syrania
* Major Settlements: none

### Tashana Tundra

The Tashana Tundra is a cold land in the north of Sarlona. It lies northwest of Dor Maleer, and is a region of mostly tundra and mountains. It is not an official kingdom, but is defined by its lack of rule. The land is mostly inhabited by shifters, humans (barbarians), and duergar, a subrace of dwarves.

Tashana is a word from an ancient shifter dialect meaning "Many Waters", referring to the hundreds of glacial lakes that dot the landscape.

### Important Dates

##### Day of Disunity (28 Rhaan)

Every year, the 28th of Rhaan is recognized as the day that the Unity of Riedra fell when the Turning of the Age happened on Dal Quor. This event is also known as the Second Sundering.
