The vast majority, if not all, of the dungeons in a Dungeons and Dragons game can be boiled down into four types. Listed in order of increasing player agency, they are: Guantlet, Hub, Labyrinth, and Maze.

>[!info] Terminology
>The descriptions below utilize generic terminology, the main ones being Challenge and Final Challenge. A Challenge may be a combat encounter, a puzzle, trap, or some other activity the party must face. There are generally several Challenges in a Dungeon, and the type of the Challenges will vary depending on the Dungeon type. On the other hand, each Dungeon should have only one Final Challenge. A Final Challenge may be a more difficult combat encounter (boss fight), a very involved puzzle, or some other activity for the party to face that will take substantially more time than a regular Challenge.

#### Gauntlet

A simple progression of rooms in which the players face a new Challenge (generally always combat) of escalating difficulty in each, until the Final Challenge (Boss) is tackled and a prize received. Little to no player agency. Any story will be presented entirely linearly.

#### Hub

A Zelda-style hub-and-wings style dungeon in which the players choose from up to four different paths, each of which offering a new and unique Challenge. Once each wing is completed, the Final Challenge will become accessible, often by something in each wing modifying the central Hub chamber in some way. Any gimmicks, such as rotating or otherwise changing Dungeon layout can work well with this Dungeon type, but should generally be restricted to the Hub room. More player agency, as the players choose the directions they want to go, but all must be completed before the Final Challenge. Any story should be presented as the changes to the Hub that eventually expose the Final Challenge.

#### Labyrinth

An AD&D or OSR style slog, with branching paths and other multiple decision points, in which players may be encouraged to make their own map (the dungeon itself is a puzzle). Gimmicks such as rotating or re-arranging maps (with appropriate digital/physical props to make the map) work well with this Dungeon type. Lots of player agency, as they need to make constant decisions about which way to go. The end (or often center) of the Labyrinth will always contain the Final Challenge, or something can be stalking the players through the Labyrinth. Any story must be delivered non-linearly, and is probably best given via environmental storytelling, since it's very likely that players will not see large swaths of the Dungeon.

#### Maze

Full Dungeons should generally not use a simplistic form of Maze navigation such as Wisdom (Survival) checks, as this becomes boring quickly and often only engages one player. Instead, Dungeon-scale Mazes should only use something like the [[Mazes Using Cards]] mechanics. In this case, the Challenges are the Monster and Trap cards that can be drawn throughout the Maze. The Final Challenge could simply be the Monster card, or a separate boss battle can be encountered at the end of the Maze. Any story is best given via environmental storytelling, flavoring the Traps/Monsters and descriptions of the Maze itself to match the story being told.
