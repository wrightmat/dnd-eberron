### Outline

#### Into the Mists (Introduction)

>[!info]-  Eberron Connection
>Per existing canon, the mists spread across Cyre on the Day of Mourning, killing or transforming anything caught within them. If you follow this path, you could say that those things twisted by the Mourning died in Eberron but lived on in the Demiplane of Dread.
>
>A possible twist on this is to start a campaign with the player characters in Cyre on the Day of Mourning (you’d want to make clear to the players that they’ve never heard of the Mourning, and that the war is still going on). They see the dead-grey mists, but when the mists pass over them… nothing happens. Everything appears to be the same. Continue the adventure as normal, but the players will eventually learn of the impassible wall of mist surrounding the borders of the nation, and discover the slowly spreading darkness that is corrupting every aspect of their land.

For any characters coming from Eberron (they will encounter anyone from Barovia immediately after this):

>The sound of clanging swords fills your ears - but it's become a persistent drone you've become used to as the war has raged on and on. That's what makes the sudden silence so jarring. The eerie silence persists as a dead-grey mist rolls toward you and your entire squadron, enveloping you and blocking your vision. But when the mists pass over you... nothing happens. Everything feels exactly the same. As you walk forward, the mists eventually begin to clear, but all you see is a single road surrounded by forests.

Anyone looking around will see a fortified village, with a stone perimeter wall, in the near distance along the road (read the S1 flavor text). This is the Village of Krezk (Chapter 8, pg. 143), but the players won't be able to get past the gates at this point. Play out all of S2, including the introduction of Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov ("Are you Strahd’s allies or enemies?"). After that's run its course, or the players try to gain access to the village, then the player with the highest Passive Perception hears the howling of wolves in the distance. If they persist, then all of the players hear the howling of wolves a little closer. If the players decide they need to flee somewhere else, then have the Vistani wagon appear (and read the text below).

>A colorful barrel-topped wagon rockets through the chilly night air, wild horses speeding it toward you. A voice rings out in your direction: "I'm here to help - grab hold of the wagon and climb in!".

Call for an Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 12) to climb onto the wagon. Madam Eva can save one player by grabbing their hand if they fail, but anyone else will still be on the road (in which case the players in the wagon may convince Eva to circle back around and pick them up, which she will do if they agree to a reading). After everyone is on board, read the text below.

>The smell of incense burns in your nose. Madam Eva, the old, hunched Vistani woman with piercing eyes and a strange smile, sits in the carriage with you. The fortune-teller offered to take you in her carriage to her encampment near the Village of Barovia in exchange for having your fortunes read. At the time it seemed a good way to avoid the wolves and other dangers of the wood, but looking into her inscrutable face, you can’t be sure. Madam Eva pulls a deck of tarokka cards from a box in her lap. She shuffles the cards and begins setting them on a small table in the middle of the carriage…

Perform the tarokka card reading, but with a stacked deck. Put only the following cards in the common deck:
* Paladin (2 of Swords/Spades)
* Mercenary (4 of Swords/Spades)
* Berserker (6 of Swords/Spades)
* Dictator (8 of Swords/Spades)
* Warrior (Master of Swords/10 of Spades)
* Transmuter (1 of Stars/Ace of Clubs)
* Evoker (6 of Stars/Clubs)
* Necromancer (8 of Stars/Clubs)
* Swashbuckler (1 of Coins/Ace of Diamonds)
* Merchant (4 of Coins/Diamonds)
* Guild Member (5 of Coins/Diamonds)
* Miser (9 of Coins/Diamonds)
* Shepherd (4 of Glyphs/Hearts)
* Anarchist (6 of Glyphs/Hearts)
* Priest (Master of Glyphs/10 of Hearts)
* Hooded One (7 of Swords/Spades)
* Elementalist (5 of Stars/Clubs)
* Bishop (8 of Glyphs/Hearts)
Switch cards 4 and 5 (from the high deck), if needed, to provide a better NPC ally for the players.

At the end of the reading, the wagon stops at the Tsar Pool Encampment (Area G, pg. 36), and Madame Eve retires to her tent. From there, the players can continue to the Village of Barovia (Chapter 3, Area E, pg. 41).

#### Village of Barovia

1. When the players return after accomplishing something (getting Ireena to Vallaki, meeting their Ally, etc.), Rahadin is sitting in his black carriage at the entrance to the Village, and hands the players their invitation to dinner.

#### Castle Ravenloft Initial (Dinner Invite)

1. Vary dinner guests based on tracts below? Otherwise just having the brides there would be the most fun (or at least Escher and one of the brides, to limit multiple character roleplay).

Welcome, my friends. I am Count Strahd von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft. Tonight, you are my guests, and no harm shall befall you while you remain in my home. I am a man of my word, and you have it.

You may wonder why I have invited you here. My reasons are threefold. First, an announcement. That shall be revealed in good time. Second, business. There is a bargain to be struck between us, and we must negotiate its finer points. Third, for the mere pleasure of your company, and for me to learn more about those who have had, might I say, an influence on my realm. Perhaps I misspeak on the last point, for I already know all I could wish to know about you. Let it suffice to say that I am eager to hear of each of you in your own words.

#### Castle Ravenloft Final

1. Likely two sessions - one to allow the characters to explore the castle on their own (with at least one visit from Strahd), and one to do the four-hour real-time final showdown with Strahd.

### Sessions

Session Zero (10/5/23) - Character Creation + Introduction (Entry into the Mists, Tser Pool Encampment)
* **Stress and Ideals/Bonds/Flaws.** Stress works in conjunction with your ideals, bonds, and flaws, so when something happens in line with or against those traits, it will impact your character in the short term (and eventually in the long term). Exhaustion mechanics are adjusted so their effects are only physical and Stress is mental.
* **Keeping Things Moving.** With an abbreviated campaign, we have to try to keep things moving. I reserve the right to break out the 1 minute timer if an encounter is dragging - if that timer runs out on your turn before you decide on what you want to do, then you take the Dodge Action and we move on. Please be thinking about your next turn while others are taking theirs.
* **Lines and Veils.** In my initial read of the entire book, I didn't see anything that was over my lines that I couldn't just easily leave out. Mostly we're dealing with basic gothic horror things here, so if you can watch a vampire movie without issues, you should be comfortable here. The worst part that we might see is some "light torture". But let's come up with a way to communicate when folks are uncomfortable (messaging me might not work since I don't usually have Discord open or my phone in front of me).
Session 1 (10/12/23) - Village of Barovia, Castle Ravenloft Initial
Session 2 (10/19/23) - Castle Ravenloft Initial continued, Tracts
Session 3 (10/26/23) - Tracts continued
Session 4 (11/2/23) - Amber Temple
Session 5 (11/9/23) - Castle Ravenloft Final (Exploration)
Session 6 (11/16/23) - Castle Ravenloft Final (Four Hours Countdown)

### Strahd Quotes

>All that is required to leave this land, is my permission; or, my life. The former will never be given, and the latter will never be taken.

>You are here because I willed it; you exist because I allow it, and you will die because I demand it.
