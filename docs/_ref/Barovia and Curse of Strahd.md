### Outline

#### Introduction

1. Entry into the Mists (below).
	1. Discovery of Krezk's Gatehouse, and possible short conversation with their bergomaster.
	2. Approach of werewolves from the woods (player with highest passive perception hears howls).
	2. Appearance of a Vistani wagon quickly approaching, with a woman (Madame Eva) yelling to the group to get in before the werewolves get here.
	3. Tarroka card reading by Madame Eva, which she requires since she gave them a ride.
		1. Limit cards to only certain areas like Castle Ravenloft and the tract areas below.
2. Tser Pool Encampment (Area G).
	1. Madame Eve goes to her tent. The players can keep asking her questions or talk to others at the camp.
	2. Near enough to both the Village of Barovia and Castle Ravenloft to connect to those areas, but should probably direct players toward the Village first.

##### Village of Barovia

1. Rahadin is sitting in his black carriage at the entrance to the Village, and hand the players their invitation before they enter.

##### Castle Ravenloft Initial (Dinner Invite)

1. Vary dinner guests based on tracts below? Otherwise just having the brides there would be the most fun (or at least Escher and one of the brides, to limit multiple character roleplay).

#### Optional Tracts
Each with a possible visit to Castle Ravenloft?

1. Tract 1: Wereravens
		1. Town of Valakki
		2. Wizard of Wines?
2. Tract 2: Witches (slash Druids?) - if Ranger/Druid in party
		1. Ruins of Berez
		2. Wizard of Wines? (short visit? may need to cut for time)
		3. Yester Hill
3. Tract 3: Werewolves - if Warlock/Cleric in party
		1. Village of Krezk
		2. Abbey of Saint Markovia
		3. Werewolf Den? (is this too much? maybe just incorporate the werewolves into the town?)
4. Tract 4: Dragons? - if Paladin or Dragonborn in party
		1. Town of Valakki?
		2. Argynvostholt

##### Amber Temple


##### Castle Ravenloft Final

1. Likely two sessions - one to allow the characters to explore the castle on their own (with at least one visit from Strahd), and one to do the four-hour real-time final showdown with Strahd.

### Sessions

1. Introduction - Entry into the Mists, Tser Pool Encampment, Village of Barovia, Castle Ravenloft #1
2. Castle Ravenloft #2 continued, Tracts
3. Tracts continued
4. Amber Temple
5. Castle Ravenloft #3
6. Castle Ravenloft #3 (Four Hours Countdown)

### Strahd Quotes

>All that is required to leave this land, is my permission; or, my life. The former will never be given, and the latter will never be taken.

>You are here because I willed it; you exist because I allow it, and you will die because I demand it.

### Eberron Connection

Per existing canon, the mists spread across Cyre on the Day of Mourning, killing or transforming anything caught within them. If you follow this path, you could say that those things twisted by the Mourning died in Eberron but lived on in the Demiplane of Dread.

A possible twist on this is to start a campaign with the player characters in Cyre on the Day of Mourning (you’d want to make clear to the players that they’ve never heard of the Mourning, and that the war is still going on). They see the dead-grey mists, but when the mists pass over them… nothing happens. Everything appears to be the same. Continue the adventure as normal, but the players will eventually learn of the impassible wall of mist surrounding the borders of the nation, and discover the slowly spreading darkness that is corrupting every aspect of their land.
