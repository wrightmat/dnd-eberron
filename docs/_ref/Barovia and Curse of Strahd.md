### Outline

##### Introduction

1. Entry into the Mists (below).
	1. Discovery of Krezk's Gatehouse, and possible short conversation with their bergomaster.
	2. Approach of werewolves from the woods (player with highest passive perception hears howls).
	2. Appearance of a Vistani wagon quickly approaching, with a woman (Madame Eva) yelling to the group to get in before the werewolves get here.
	3. Tarroka card reading by Madame Eva, which she requires since she gave them a ride.
		1. Limit cards to only certain areas like Castle Ravenloft and the tract areas below.
2. Tser Pool Encampment (Area G).
	1. Madame Eve goes to her tent. The players can keep asking her questions or talk to others at the camp.
	2. Near enough to both the Village of Barovia and Castle Ravenloft to connect to those areas, but should probably direct players toward the Village first.
3. Village of Barovia
4. Castle Ravenloft #1 (Dinner Invite)
5. Tracts (each with a possible visit to Castle Ravenloft?)
6. Amber Temple
7. Castle Ravenloft #3 (Final Confrontation)

### Eberron Connection

Per existing canon, the mists spread across Cyre on the Day of Mourning, killing or transforming anything caught within them. If you follow this path, you could say that those things twisted by the Mourning died in Eberron but lived on in the Demiplane of Dread.

A possible twist on this is to start a campaign with the player characters in Cyre on the Day of Mourning (you’d want to make clear to the players that they’ve never heard of the Mourning, and that the war is still going on). They see the dead-grey mists, but when the mists pass over them… nothing happens. Everything appears to be the same. Continue the adventure as normal, but the players will eventually learn of the impassible wall of mist surrounding the borders of the nation, and discover the slowly spreading darkness that is corrupting every aspect of their land.
