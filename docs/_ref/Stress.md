The stress system is based on the exhaustion system, overhauling exhaustion and adding a new system entirely for stress. The following changes are made to exhaustion:
* 1 - Disadvantage on physical* ability checks
* 2 - Speed halved
* 3 - Disadvantage on attack rolls and physical* saving throws
* 4 - Hit point maximum halved
* 5 - Speed reduced to 0
* 6 - Death

Exhaustion would be removed in the normal fashion (a long rest, potions of Greater Restoration and Vitality, or high quality meals).

### Stress

* 1 - Disadvantage on mental* ability checks
* 2 - Gain one of the following debuffs until stress is reduced to 0 (choose one):
	* Distracted - AC reduced by 2.
	* Headaches - Proficiency bonus not added to ability checks or saving throws.
	* Pessimism - Critical successes are treated as normal rolls.
	* Dread - Always place last on initiative order.
* 3 - Sleep does not heal exhaustion (nightmares) and disadvantage on mental* saving throws
* 4 - Mental* ability scores halved
* 5 - Player experiences hallucinations, hears voices in their head, experiences powerful urges to do things they normally wouldn't, and other mind-altering events.
* 6 - Indefinite Madness Flaw (roll on PHB table)

Some potential causes for Stress include (but are not limited to):
* Entering a battle against a difficult opponent (such as the campaign BBEG)
* Making a critical failure or suffering a critical hit
* Seeing a party member drop to 0 hit points
* Negative social encounters
* Anything that plays to a flaw or goes against a bond or ideal
When a player is in a situation that may cause stress, have them roll a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 by default, or another DC as determined by the DM depending on the situation), with their Stress increasing on a failure.

Some ways to remove Stress may include (but aren't limited to):
* Receiving encouragement from members of your party
* Performing an action that adheres to a bond or ideal
* Winning a battle without taking damage
* The *lesser restoration* spell can relieve one level of Stress.
Stress is removed without a check. The DM may also choose for one level of Stress to be removed on a long rest.

The idea behind Stress is that it's not just the kind of stress you experience every day when completing a hard task. This is lasting, lingering stress - the kind that makes you doubt yourself, your friends, your ability to complete the quest, and ultimately your concept of how the world works. It has your players answer the question of what their characters do to de-stress, or how they would try to help a party member suffering from stress.

*Physical ability scores are STR, DEX, and CON, while mental ability scores are INT, WIS, and CHA.
