The only core rules for swarms are part of the swarm creature stat blocks and are very basic and boring.
	***Swarm***. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny raven. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

That's all well and good, but in addition to that, use the rules below to make swarms more interesting and more of a challenge.

### Swarm Mechanics

 - When an attack or effect would target a single creature, it effects the entire swarm as if it was a single creature, meaning that it may be able to damage more than one creature in the swarm if it deals enough damage.

 - Instead of tracking each creature in the swarm's health independently, instead keep track of the total damage taken by the swarm. When the damage taken exceeds the health of a single individual, remove one unit from the size of that swarm, and reduce the total by the hit point maximum of a single individual in the swarm.

 - When a swarm makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, add the number of creatures in the swarm to the roll instead of their ordinary modifier. For example, a cloud of steam mephits composed of 7 creatures would have a +7 to hit instead of a +2.

 - A swarm uses the normal attacks and damage that an individual would have access to. Just as above, instead of the normal modifier, add the number of creatures in the swarm to the damage of attacks. Typically, this will be the ability modifier used to make the attack, though some features may add more to this bonus damage. For example, the steam mephit cloud above would do 1d4+7 (9) for their claw attack.
