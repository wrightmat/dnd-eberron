#item [[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

The Tome of Strahd is a magical item that helps save against Strahd's charm. Additionally, the players can make an investigation check to learn random knowledge about Barovia or Castle Ravenloft.

I know I am not mad. I am seeing familiar faces reborn. Something in the mists is trapping the souls which would pass beyond - forcing some sort of reincarnation among my people. Do the Dark Powers mean to taunt me? Trap an entire people in an endless cycle of misery alongside my own? Perhaps they torment me with false hope - that my Tatyana will be reborn too.

The dark cycle of reincarnation has reached its limits. Across my realm are children born hollow. These subjects have but a scrap of the soul necessary to a mortal. Though otherwise ordinary, they are especially dour, fearful, and unimaginative. But of greatest interest to me is that I find no sustenance in their blood. Some vital essence is lacking. It is no more nourishing than sand to a thirsty man. I will study this to pass the time. I am certain there are many disappointed and hapless parents in Barovia who can be convinced to surrender their hollowborn children to my care.

The crime of the elves is beyond all measure of forgiveness and justice. I should have eliminated them when I first conquered this valley centuries ago. I have ordered the death of every female elf in the valley for what they have done to Patrina. Despite their comeliness, the elves will never know womanly comfort among their own kind. Despite their longevity, they will fade from existence as I outlive them.

Vladimir's accursed silver knights have slain yet another adventuring band. From what I witnessed while scrying, the knights slew them for seeking my destruction. I do not understand why my mortal enemies would defend me. I can only reason that Vladimir believes mere death to be too good of a demise for me. Perhaps the revenant wishes to bear witness to my eternal sentence.

**DC 20.**
The Heart glows with purpose. It has become living. The circles of masonry about its tower its ribs, the great bastion its chest. The tests on the condemned proved the heart will use the tower itself against invaders. My will sustains it, but it is mere glass, fragile, ironically mortal. With it, I am sheltered from the unthinkable. Yet, I cannot prove reckless. The antimagic field around Khazan's tower separates me from the Heart. I must be cautious of such places.

I have also succeeded in granting my old battle armor the same form of sentience Khazan gave to his own. I have empowered it with my will and the might of storms and instructed it to defend the castle. In great need I may summon it to myself and don it with a word, provided the damn thing hasn't stumbled off a parapet and shattered itself.

**DC 23**. _Reveals all of Strahd's standard spells as a usable wizard spellbook while attuned. Additionally, the attuned character may cast these spells as a ritual without the need for the Ritual Casting feature._

**DC 25.** _Reveals the command word for the daern's instant fortress inside the Ravenloft treasury, albeit with no context given. The players will merely know that this is likely an important password to something._
