#item [[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

The Tome of Strahd is a magical item that helps save against Strahd's charm. Additionally, the players can make an investigation check to learn random knowledge about Barovia or Castle Ravenloft.

**DC 8.** The dark cycle of reincarnation has reached its limits. Across my realm are children born hollow. These subjects have but a scrap of the soul necessary to a mortal. Though otherwise ordinary, they are especially dour, fearful, and unimaginative. But of greatest interest to me is that I find no sustenance in their blood. Some vital essence is lacking. It is no more nourishing than sand to a thirsty man. I will study this to pass the time. I am certain there are many disappointed and hapless parents in Barovia who can be convinced to surrender their hollowborn children to my care.

**DC 10.** I know I am not mad. I am seeing familiar faces reborn. Something in the mists is trapping the souls which would pass beyond -- forcing some sort of reincarnation among my people. Do the Dark Powers mean to taunt me? Trap an entire people in an endless cycle of misery alongside my own? Perhaps they torment me with false hope - that my Tatyana will be reborn too.

**DC 12.** The crime of the elves is beyond all measure of forgiveness and justice. I should have eliminated them when I first conquered this valley centuries ago. I have ordered the death of every female elf in the valley for what they have done to Patrina. Despite their comeliness, the elves will never know womanly comfort among their own kind. Despite their longevity, they will fade from existence as I outlive them.

**DC 15.** I had tasked the Wachter family with hunting down Leo Dilisnya, the Ba'al Verzi traitor of that night of death fifty years ago. Barovia is by no means large, but Leo had buried himself quite well. I was certain he had not escaped the country. Since the night of his betrayal, the borders of Barovia had, for all purposes, been closed. He was cloistered away in the Kresk monastery under a false name. I drained him and removed his corpse to the Wachter estate where he was interned in a stone crypt sealed with cement. He rose the night after. I could imagine him futilely beating the stone sides. No matter he had the strength of the undead, he could not shift the stone, no matter he could he could shift into mist, he could not find a pinprick to escape from. He would feel the power of his change, the rage, the maddening hunger. He will live on for as long as he may and then be damned.

**DC 19.** Vladimir's accursed silver knights have slain yet another adventuring band. From what I witnessed while scrying, the knights slew them for seeking my destruction. I do not understand why my mortal enemies would defend me. I can only reason that Vladimir believes mere death to be too good of a demise for me. Perhaps the revenant wishes to bear witness to my eternal sentence.

**DC 18.** I have succeeded in granting my old battle armor the same form of sentience Khazan gave to his own. I have empowered it with my will and the might of storms and instructed it to defend the castle. In great need I may summon it to myself and don it with a word, provided the damn thing hasn't stumbled off a parapet and shattered itself.

**DC 19.** This foolish deva believes _me_ the fool. This holy man seeks to free me of my sins through lust of the flesh. I will allow him to continue as long as I can hold his attention. He is no threat to me while he continues in his perverted folly in Kresk. I have no interest in his depraved gift; it is wholly unnatural to desire such an abomination. Tatyana will free me. When she returns, she will have me.

**DC 20.** The Heart glows with purpose. It has become living. The circles of masonry about its tower its ribs, the great bastion its chest. The tests on the condemned proved the heart will use the tower itself against invaders. My will sustains it, but it is mere glass, fragile, ironically mortal. With it, I am sheltered from the unthinkable. Yet, I cannot prove reckless. The antimagic field around Khazan's tower separates me from the Heart. I must be cautious of such places.

**DC 24**. _Reveals all of Strahd's standard spells as a usable wizard spellbook while attuned. Additionally, the attuned character may cast these spells as a ritual without the need for the Ritual Casting feature._

**DC 25.** _Reveals the command word for the daern's instant fortress inside the Ravenloft treasury, albeit with no context given. The players will merely know that this is likely an important password to something._
