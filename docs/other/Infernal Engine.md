The Infernal Engine is an Eldritch Machine tied to the plane of Shavarath, that's seemingly capturing people to fight on the Eternal Battlefield. Every time Shavarath becomes coterminus (one year out of every thirty-six years), and sometimes at other seemingly random times, the machine appears and disappears with whoever is nearby. The first known cycle was when it was discovered in Ohr Khaluun, Sarlona in 1002 YK, and then again later that year in Pyrine, Sarlona.

Sometimes people who were taken by the Infernal Engine are randomly found at a Manifest Zone to Shavarath. In fact, there have been some limited reports of a feral colony of taken at the Ash Tower in the Mournland. Taken have also been found returned to the Blade Desert in Valenar, especially near the ruins of an ancient coliseum.
