### Eberron Space Race

The PCs created the first cannon Spelljammer in the Eberron setting, but in the process, they exposed the information to several other parties - including House Cannith and the Church of the Silver Flame. With enough time, various factions are likely to start building Spelljammer ships, likely starting with House Cannith. The party actually has a chance to encounter one ship, "The Gorgon" while exploring Shardspace.

* **The Dragonmarked Fleet:** House Cannith, using the plans obtained from The Mournland, partner with House Lyrandar to create a Spelljammer ship based on elemental galleons.
	* This ship is called **The Gorgon**. Captained by Lei d'Cannith (Engineer) with a crew composed of Mazzia d'Lyrandar (Pilot), Velgram (Quartermaster), Daine Deneith (Navigator), Pierce the Warforged (Gunner), and an experimental Autognome crew member created by Merrix d'Cannith (see "The Cannith Autognome" in the Spelljammer reference article) named Lex (Medic).
	* The ship uses bound elementals along with a Siberys dragonshard Spelljamming helm, and looks almost exactly like other elemental galleons, down to the soarwood hull and the elemental ring around it.
	* The ship has already been launched, and may be encountered randomly while in Shardspace.

* **The Fleet of the Flame:** The Church of the Silver Flame, using the plans that Onme directly gave them from The Mournland, are starting to build their own ship within Scion's Sounds near Flamekeep.
	* This ship is called **Tira's Sacrifice**. Captained by "Spiney" (Pilot), with a crew composed of two of the other orphans (Navigator and Engineer), Defender (Gunner), and Seltern Obranch (Medic).
	* The ship uses a Siberys dragonshard Spelljamming helm that channels the celestial power of the Silver Flame to drive the ship. It rises from a fiery pool at the center of a brilliant circular mosaic of floor tiles, inlaid with golden Siberys dragonshard veins. There are silver-inlaid black marble floors throughout the inside of the ship. The outside of the ship is composed of white alabaster walls (stone) fitted with dozens of tall, stained glass windows in ornate, wrought-iron frames (much like the Cathedral of the Silver Flame).
	* The ship has not been launched, but can be encountered if the party returns to Eberron, or could be launched and be encountered at the Ring of Siberys later in the game.
