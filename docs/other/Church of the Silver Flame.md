The Church of the Silver Flame is the state religion of Thrane. The followers of the religion are called the Purified. The church is broadly divided into three orders - the Order of Ministers, the Order of Templars, and the Order of Friars. The church is led by the Keeper of the Flame and the Council of Cardinals, and includes several secretive groups like Miron's Tears and The Argentum.

Valediction:: "May the Silver Flame burn bright"; Response: "The Voice of the Flame guide you". Traditionally spoken by members of the church when departing.

### Order of Ministers

The Order of Ministers is the largest and broadest of the three orders. Outside of Thrane, the order of ministers is only charged with administering to the matters church, although many ministers still find themselves involved in local politics.

Inside of Thrane, the Order of Ministers also act as the government - performing not only local governance but judicial functions. While ministers are on balance better educated and more invested directly in the people's needs than the local rulers of other nations, they still sometimes find themselves caught between the duties of faith and the duties of governance.

Structurally, the Order of Ministers makes up the majority of the top levels of the church's hierarchy, privileged with purely bureaucratic duties.

### Order of Templars

The Order of Templars is the militant arm of the church, historically charged with protecting the innocent from evil. Whether a vampire, witch, or fiend, the Knights Templar have destroyed or imprisoned countless threats. Templars are supposed to protect all innocents regardless of whether a local town pays many tithes to the church, although corrupt opportunists sometimes extort communities.

The Last War merged the Templars of Thrane and the Army of Thrane, causing issues for the order's legitimacy. Even today, a regiment of Thranish knights may have issues pursuing supernatural threats across borders as local authorities question if they're serving the mission of the church or the state. Templars in other nations found their loyalty questioned whether they chose to serve in their nation's armies or not. While the templars broadly have no higher titles than "Prefect", the Thranish army does include higher ranks such as Sacrosanct (Major) and Argent (Colonel). Outside of Thrane, Prefects fall under the command and control of their archbishop and work in tandem with the local bishop.

**Rank**

Ranks of the Templars are listed below, from lowest to highest). Rank is displayed by a circular Rondel depicting the Silver Flame arrowhead, attached to the right side of the breastplate, with varying color.

- **Squire** – A younger man or woman, greater than 14 years of age but fewer than 18. A future Knight who spends their time in the service of a current Knight. At the age of 18, they will have the opportunity to petition to become a “Companion-at-Arms.” Squires do not wear a Rank Rondel.
- **Companion-At-Arms** – An Squire of at least 18 years of age can apply to become a Companion-At-Arms, where they will serve as a full apprentice to a Knight in the field or in the temple. Companions are allowed to actually take up arms and do substantially more work than a Squire (who is mostly just observing and serving). Companions will usually take a few classes in the Temple during this time as well. Companions-At-Arms wear a Rank Rondel of Dark Steel.
- **Sergeant** – All Sergeants are required to complete Templar Academy classes. Once a Companion has completed their apprenticeship and classwork, they will be promoted to the Sergeant rank. A Sergeant serves as a Mentor in the Temple, where they strive to help their Brothers and Sisters. Sergeants wear a Rank Rondel of Light Steel.
- **Knight** – When actual Knighthood is granted, duty is expected to his or her community and church. “Knight” is used by men & women equally, and are commonly referred to as “Sister Templar” or “Brother Templar”. Knights wear a Rank Rondel of Rose Copper.
- **Knight Lieutenant** – The first level of a “Knight Officer.” A “Knight Lieutenant” is a ranked Officer that is trusted for extra responsibility and duties. They have demonstrated faithfulness to their Commanders, but don’t yet have their own group to command. Knight Lieutenants wear a Rank Rondel of Blue Bronze.
- **Knight Captain** – A Knight Lieutenant who has proven themselves as an officer is given more responsibility as a Knight Captain. Knight Captains wear a Rank Rondel of Purple Byeshk. Knight Captains may have a Companion-at-Arms, but only if there is an excess.
- **Knight Major** – A Knight Captain who has highly proven themselves as an officer and has gone above and beyond are given more responsibility. Knight Majors wear a Rank Rondel of Dull Gold. Every Knight Major generally has a Companion-at-Arms.
- **Knight Commander** – A Knight who is given a Commandery consisting of at a least 5 knights besides the Commander. Knight Commanders wear a Rank Rondel of Bright Silver.
- **Prefect** – Only a few Templars make it to the rank of Prefect, with each one taking leadership of all Templars in a region or group of regions, depending on size and complexity. For example, one Prefect would be over all of Thrane, while another might control the Eldeen Reaches, Droaam, the Shadow Marches, and the Demon Wastes combined. Prefects wear two Rank Rondels of Bright Silver, one on each side of the breastplate.

### Order of Friars

Charged with wandering the world and spreading the light of faith, the Order of Friars is the least hierarchical of the Church's three orders. While Friars never lead cities or regions, some rare few friars have made the jump to the Council of Cardinals.

Pilgrims are the initiate rank of the order and below all other ranks in the church. While not required to perform missionary work, pilgrims do lead by example and represent the faith.

Friars travel Khorvaire, attempting to convert new followers to the Silver Flame. Furthermore, Friars are typically trained in investigation, acting as the eyes of the church to report instances of supernatural evil such as cults or possessions.

### Council of Cardinals

The Council of Cardinals stands above the other orders in the church, administering to the broad concerns of the faith. Cardinals primarily attend to bureaucratic concerns, with many of them having spent the past 84 years running a nation. Cardinals are nominated and elected by existing cardinals, leading to the majority coming from the Order of Ministers.

The Diet of Cardinals are chosen by the Keeper of the Flame, although new Keepers rarely remove cardinals from the diet. The true governing body of both the Church and Thrane, the Diet collectively makes decisions on behalf of both. It is currently led by High Cardinal Krozen.

### The Keeper of the Flame

The Keeper of the Flame is directly chosen by Tira Miron, the Voice of the Flame. The Keeper ultimately leads the Church, but delegates most authority to the Cardinals. The current keeper is Jaela Daran.

### Miron’s Tears

In a conversation struck from the official record, Tira Miron tasked Samyr Kes with being her chosen avenger against those corrupted by the the Shadow in the Flame.

Samyr Kes established the Order of Miron's Tears, so named for the tears Tira shed when assigning him his task, and acts as the leader of this secretive order of sacred assassins that roots out corruption within the Church of the Silver Flame.

### The Argentum

The Argentum is a ministry of the Church of the Silver Flame and Thrane's intelligence agency. It has a focus on the collection and study of magic items, with the goal of furthering Thrane's political and magical position in the world.

Minister Nystrum Shadar answers directly to the Council of Cardinals, but does share information with Queen Diani ir'Wynarn—why this is, isn't entirely clear.

Shadar has twenty-four directors, each of whom have teams that report to them. These directors are broken up by function: research teams are divided up by magic item types, while couriers, spies, and information gatherers are separated by nation. One of the most prominent directors is Lycia Velencor, Director of Artifact Research.

Agents are coded by one of three colors—white, black, gray—in ascending order of influence. White agents only interact with a single point of contact, while black agents are more properly integrated into the agency. Gray agents have enough pull to direct their own missions and are hand-selected by Minister Shadar.

The Argentum is largely a secret organization. Nystrum Shadar is a well-known retired army general, but most Thranes assume he's living a life of quiet retirement after the Last War. Other members of other intelligence agencies (e.g., the King's Citadel or the Royal Eyes of Aundair) are more likely to know about the Argentum.

Unlike some other agencies, it is possible to leave the Argentum, however members who leave are subject to a geas spell with instructions not to divulge the secrets of the organization.

### Priesthood

Unlike most other faiths, which are primarily regional or cultural, the Silver Flame appeals to specific types of people. A faith based on purging evil calls most clearly to those with similar goals. People who believe the world is not just and wish to make it so, those who have been wronged (by individuals, governments, or even other faiths), and those who yearn to make a difference and to give their lives real meaning, are all likely candidates for worship of the Flame. The precepts of faith dictate that simply leading a virtuous life is a blow against evil. Even common worshipers of the Silver Flame, incapable of crusading against evil, try to lead lives of goodness and charity. The majority of the Church’s priests come from their ranks.

That said, not all faithful, or all priests, focus on virtue to the exclusion of all else. The Church of the Silver Flame is a powerful religion, particularly in Thrane and specific communities of other nations. Advancement in the Church is a viable path to temporal and political power. A sizable minority of priests seek to advance not the Flame’s objectives, but their own. As the Church spreads and new generations are born into its worship, it becomes more of an establishment. In the earliest days, the Purified were entirely converts, and their faith was absolute. Today, the Church of the Silver Flame is becoming a cultural presence, although not nearly as much so as the Sovereign Host or the Undying Court. Entire populations worship the Flame because they were raised to do so, not because its precepts called to them. This has increased the numbers of the Purified, but it has also diluted the intensity of their belief. Like the priesthood of the Sovereign Host, the Church of the Silver Flame is seen by some as a mere vocation, a means to make a living for those with few other prospects.

#### Becoming A Priest

Taking the cloth in the Church of the Silver Flame is a rigid, formal procedure. The would-be acolyte must serve under a Silver Flame priest, learning the basics of the faith. This period might last for only a few months, or as long as several years. Once this training is complete, the acolyte petitions for admission to one of the Church’s many seminaries, located throughout the civilized nations. The most prestigious of these include the Psalm of the Flame Seminary, or simply the Great Seminary, which is part of the massive Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Flamekeep, Thrane; and Saint Ignatius the Mentor’s School for Divine Service in the city of Passage, Aundair.

Before being accepted as a seminarian, the petitioner is subject to a battery of questions and tests of faith. These are almost entirely verbal or written, but they are intense. The individual need not show a deep knowledge of the scripture or liturgy — only what one would be expected to learn when serving a priest — but must display unshakable devotion to the Flame itself. She must demonstrate past acts of charity, faith, and goodness, and she must find at least one established priest to speak for her.

A successful petitioner becomes a seminarian for a period of no less than four years. During this time, she receives intense training in matters of philosophy, history, and dogma. If she displays a propensity for adept or cleric magic, or the calling of a paladin, her training focuses in these areas as well. At the end of every year, seminarians are tested on their knowledge and their faith. Early trials are mere tests, such as those required for admission, but later ones ask the student to solve real community problems, adjudicate doctrinal disputes, and make moral judgments. Most who fail are permitted to retake the year’s courses, and no stigma is attached to those who require more than four years to graduate. A truly horrific failure, however, revealing corruption or a flaw in character, might result in expulsion.

All in all, seminary training is a long and arduous process. Those who succeed emerge as true priests of the Silver Flame, with all the rights and responsibilities of the office. During the course of the training, instructors study the students’ interests and talents, and recommend which of the Church’s various orders to consider upon graduation. A new priest is not bound to follow this advice, but the vast majority of them do so.

All priests, and indeed all followers, of the Silver Flame have one duty above all others: Purge the world of evil. Everything else pales before this one imperative. Priests of the Flame do not necessarily have to seek out evil if doing so is beyond their abilities or expertise, but should they stumble across it, they must not turn their backs or shut their eyes. They must try to destroy it or at least expose it to the light of justice if possible. If not, they must seek out those who can.

Obviously, how driven a given priest is depends on which order he represents. Many templars, and some pilgrims, actively hunt creatures and people of evil, either to destroy them, bring them to justice, or show them the error of their ways. These devoted few have little time for other duties. For the less martially inclined, however, the struggle against evil could simply be a matter of leading virtuous lives and encouraging others to do the same. Friars, priests, and cardinals have many other duties, and many simply are not equipped to hunt down demons or criminals.

Clergy of the Silver Flame conduct ceremonies and lead prayers for their faithful, just as priests of other faiths do. Because the faith of the Silver Flame originally grew from those who worshiped the Sovereign Host, they undertake many of the same duties, even if they go about them by different means. These include leading services, holy day rites, and life-event rituals; offering counsel to the faithful, or to any who seek it; and undertaking charitable works. This last is considered to be of paramount importance, since alleviating suffering is a step on the road to banishing evil.

One duty on which the Purified place substantially more importance than do the worshipers of the Sovereign Host, however, is evangelism and proselytizing. The followers of the Silver Flame believe that their duty is to cleanse Eberron entirely of evil. Spreading the faith can hasten that glorious aim. After all, those who turn to the Flame are less likely to commit acts of evil themselves (or so the theory goes). Furthermore, the more Purified there are, the more soldiers the Flame has to battle the forces of evil. Either way, good grows stronger and evil weaker.

All priests of the Silver Flame, regardless of rank or order, must wear the holy symbol of the faith when engaging in the duties of their office. They are supposed to wear it at all times, but this dictate is less rigorously enforced. If doing so would put them in danger — such as a templar attempting to infiltrate a stronghold of evil, or a pilgrim passing through Droaam — they are permitted to go without. When conducting services, priests wear garb of predominantly silver and white. It might be white robes with silver trim, silver armor, or whatever else is appropriate to the circumstances.

True clerics of the Silver Flame have a religious duty to avoid spells that raise the dead, such as resurrection. The Purified believe that the souls of the faithful join with the Silver Flame after death, granting them an afterlife of peace and bliss, and strengthening the Flame itself. Thus, calling a soul back weakens the Flame and subjects the soul to further pain and suffering in the material world. Clerics of the Flame return the dead to life under only the most extreme circumstances, and only if the dangers of not doing so outweigh the possible trauma to the soul. Most Purified priests cannot be enticed to do so for any amount of money, though the Church does have members who bow to temptation. Raising a member of some other faith is even less likely. In all recorded history, fewer than half-a-dozen instances exist of a Silver Flame cleric resurrecting a non–Purified individual, and each case was the result of a greedy or weak-willed cleric being tempted by material reward.

#### Fallen Priests

The procedure for defrocking a priest is just as rigid and formal as that for taking the cloth. Any Purified can bring charges against a priest simply by offering a formal complaint to any clergy member of equal or higher rank. The priest who receives the complaint turns it over to an inquisitor. In many cases, the complaint is without merit, and the inquisitor swiftly dismisses it; the accused might never even know she was under investigation.

Should the initial inquiry suggest a more thorough examination, the subject is formally accused of wrongdoing, temporarily stripped of her authority, and placed under guard while the inquisitor investigates. These investigations can involve standard detective work and information gathering, discern lies and other divination spells, or, in extreme circumstances with a particularly driven and brutal inquisitor, physical coercion.

Certain lesser crimes result in expulsion from the priesthood, but no further punishment. These include corruption, lying to superiors, failure to uphold one’s duties as a priest, taking inappropriate advantage of congregants, and similar offenses. Some crimes, however, are so great that the Church dispenses lethal justice on those who commit them. A priest who secretly prays to the Lords of Dust, for instance, is likely to be executed as a heretic and traitor, as is a priest who murders other priests.
