The Chamber, or the Calemaryx in Draconic, is a loose alliance of dragons, no more than a hundred, that secretly attempt to manipulate events on Khorvaire.

### History

The Chamber was founded less than four thousand years ago as a response to the rise in dragonmarks across the common races of Khorvaire and the islands of Aerenal. Young dragons of all colors made an impassioned argument before the Conclave of Argonnessen to protect the dragonmarked, and to do their best to monitor and use them to serve the Draconic Prophecy.

The dragons of the Chamber were involved in tipping off the Conclave of Argonnessen of the activities of Minara Vol and the draconic rogue known as the Emerald Claw, which led to the ultimate extinction of House Vol.

### Activities

The Chamber operates in contrast to the prevailing attitude of most dragons on Argonnessen, who are mostly obsessed with the Draconic Prophecy and not disrupting it.

The Chamber, while prone to taking an active hand in the affairs of Eberron, is not a body that works directly. Indeed, very few beings know of its existence. Instead, the dragons of the Chamber operate through proxies in order to keep their involvement secret. But occasionally some of the dragons in the organization do take a direct approach and disguise themselves as one of the lesser races and offer their help as advisors to royalty or watching silently while manipulating from behind the scenes.

### Organization

The Chamber is a comparatively young organization by draconic standards, with most of its members no older than mature adults (600 years). Some older members of the organization, such as the dragons present at its founding, guide the organization from the Tapestry in Argonnessen.

A member of the Chamber is known as a 'Chamber observer'.

There are two main paths for the dragons of the organization: Shapers, who attempt to actively guide the dragonmarked to fulfill conditions of the Draconic Prophecy, and Preservers, who are content to sit passively and let the branch of the Draconic Prophecy take its course.

The Chamber makes use of shared cover identities to monitor and influence events in Khorvaire to their own ends. They have infiltrated many established organizations in Khorvaire. They closely monitor the Church of the Silver Flame and have infiltrated the organization since they share a common enemy in the Lords of Dust. Other organizations they have compromised include the Dark Lanterns of Breland, the Royal Eyes of Aundair, House Phiarlan, and House Tharashk. They maintain mortal agents within the Seren tribes, among others.

The Chamber observers are opposed to manipulation of the Draconic Prophecy in order to honor Ourelonastrix and Hezcalipa's discovery during the Age of Demons. To this end, they oppose organizations that seek to understand the Draconic Prophecy including the Undying Court of Aerenal, the Twelve, and finally the Lords of Dust. They also are opposed by the Mosaic Committee of the Arcane Congress, who seek to destroy pieces of the Draconic Prophecy to avoid catastrophe on a scale unseen.

One of their fiercest opponents of late has been the forces of Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flame. Since his binding in 298 YK by Tira Miron, the Overlord has attempted to turn the Draconic Prophecy against the dragons. They often face off against his prakhutu on the Bleak Council and chief servant, Durastoran the Wyrmbreaker.

Additionally, Chamber observers and their agents sometimes work in opposition to one another based on their favored outcome for the specific branch of the Draconic Prophecy.

### Bases of Operations

The Chamber is based out of Vorel'aurex in the Tapestry of Argonnessen. Beyond that they are decentralized and draconic agents run their own operations.

The Chamber maintains safehouses across the cities of Khorvaire and even in Stormreach in Xen'drik.

The Chamber's newest and most powerful base is in Flamekeep at the seat of the Church of the Silver Flame itself. One of their plants, Spindelaryx, is now the Church's Prefect of the region.
