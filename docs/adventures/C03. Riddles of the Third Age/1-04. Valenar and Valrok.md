### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Taer Valior (nearby city)
	Medium-sized fort city with basic shops, armorers, and weapon smiths. Can also introduce Gunnora here.

 - [ ]  Approaching Blade Coliseum
	The ancient coliseum rises from the Blade Desert sands like a forgotten relic of a bygone era. As players approach, they behold a grand structure built from weathered sandstone and adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of bravery, honor, and valor. The entrance, flanked by massive statues of majestic sphinxes standing as eternal guardians, beckons adventurers to test their mettle within its hallowed grounds. Inside, the coliseum is quartered into four sections with impossibly tall walls.

 - [ ]  Pillars of Strength
	As the players enter the coliseum, they see an open space dominated only by towering stone pillars. Each pillar can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics or Acrobatics check. A successful DC 12 Investigation check (made with disadvantage from the ground) reveals ropes that connect the pillars to each other and to the far wall. Immediately after the players arrive, swarms of enemies enter the chamber.
	The next challenge awaits in a chamber dominated by towering stone pillars. Each pillar requires a display of physical strength and bravery to ascend. Players must climb these pillars while facing various trials and adversities, symbolizing the resilience and determination required to overcome obstacles.

 - [ ]  Maze of Courage
	Players encounter a labyrinthine maze adorned with shifting walls and perplexing pathways. This maze challenges their bravery as they navigate through ominous corridors and overcome daunting obstacles, testing their resolve to press forward despite uncertainty.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  Several elves who barely escaped Shae Mordai alive are certain that the attack was performed by Obsidian dragons. But no one has seen any Obsidian dragons since.

### DM Notes

* Should probably give the players some sort of map or an NPC who can help guide them. This might be a good point to do so, otherwise they might get little overwhelmed and lost when the world basically opens up and they don't know where to go next.
