### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Taer Valior (nearby city)
	Medium-sized fort city with basic shops, armorers, and weapon smiths. Can also introduce Gunnora here.

 - [ ]  Approaching Blade Coliseum (Blade Desert)
	Inside the coliseum, the arena is quartered into four sections. The final section contains a staircase that leads to an underground chamber serving as the Sphinx's lair.
>An ancient but once grand coliseum stands as a testament to the courage and valor of ancient warriors. Massive sandstone walls rise high above, adorned with faded murals depicting epic battles and tales of triumph. Torch sconces line the walls, casting flickering shadows that dance across the ground. 

 - [ ]  Pillars of Strength
	As the players enter the coliseum, they see an open space dominated only by towering stone pillars. Each pillar can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics or Acrobatics check. A successful DC 12 Investigation check (made with disadvantage from the ground) reveals ropes that connect the pillars to each other and to the far wall. Immediately after the players arrive, swarms of enemies enter the chamber.

 - [ ]  Maze of Courage
	Players encounter a labyrinthine maze adorned with shifting walls and perplexing pathways. This maze challenges their bravery as they navigate through ominous corridors and overcome daunting obstacles, testing their resolve to press forward despite uncertainty.

 - [ ]  Hall of Illusions
	Players face illusions that test their resolve - roll on the table below once for each character. Each PC may make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw to determine if they can see through the illusion, with a failure resulting in the dictated effect.

| d12 | Illusion   | Effect |
| --- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1   | Red dragon |        |
| 2   | Cloud giant   |        |
| 3   | Ettin  |        |
| 4   | Beholder           |        |
| 5   | Night hag           |        |
| 6   | Assassin           |        |
| 7   | Fire giant           |        |
| 8   | Gnoll           |        |
| 9   | Kobold           |        |
| 10  | Lich           |        |
| 11  | Frost giant           |        |
| 12  | Troll           |        |


 - [ ]  The Abyss of Fear
	The final challenge lies in a vast chamber shrouded in magical darkness (so artificial light sources don't work, but darkvision does). This area tests the players' courage in the face of their deepest fears, with unseen adversaries lurking in the shadows. Immediately have PCs roll initiative. On each turn, roll a d4, with a 1 resulting in a shadow finding that character (see below). PCs can do anything they would like (as usual) in addition to the below options:
	* PCs who cannot see may make a DC 10 Perception check to ascertain the location of any shadows. Failure results in one of the shadows finding that character.
	* Any PC may make a DC 12 Survival check (at disadvantage if they can't see) to attempt to find the exit. Three successful (non-sequential) checks are needed to find it.
	When a shadow finds a PC, they must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they become overwhelmed with fear and must describe one of their character's fears.

 - [ ]  Several elves who barely escaped Shae Mordai alive are certain that the attack was performed by Obsidian dragons. But no one has seen any Obsidian dragons since.
