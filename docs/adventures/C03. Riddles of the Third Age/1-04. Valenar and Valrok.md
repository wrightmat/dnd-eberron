### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Taer Valior (nearby city)
	Medium-sized fort city with basic shops, armorers, and weapon smiths. Can also introduce Gunnora here.

 - [ ]  Approaching Blade Coliseum (Blade Desert)
	Inside the coliseum, the arena is quartered into four sections. The final section contains a staircase that leads to an underground chamber serving as the Sphinx's lair.
>An ancient but once grand coliseum stands as a testament to the courage and valor of ancient warriors. Massive sandstone walls rise high above, adorned with faded murals depicting epic battles and tales of triumph. Torch sconces line the walls, casting flickering shadows that dance across the ground. 

 - [ ]  Pillars of Strength
	As the players enter the coliseum, they see an open space dominated only by towering stone pillars. Each pillar can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics or Acrobatics check. A successful DC 12 Investigation check (made with disadvantage from the ground) reveals ropes that connect the pillars to each other and to the far wall. Immediately after the players arrive, swarms of enemies enter the chamber.

 - [ ]  Pit of Bravery: Taming the Elemental Flame
	This chamber is filled with an uncontrolled elemental flame. Players must subdue or harness the flame's power to advance. They can use spells, skills, or magical items to pacify the flame or redirect its energy into braziers. Players may use various spells (like Control Flames, Create Water) or skills (like Arcana or Persuasion) to control the elemental flame. Failure might result in taking fire damage or triggering the flame to spread.

 - [ ]  Gates of Valor
	This chamber is composed of a series of three massive gates blocking the path forward. To proceed, players must succeed in a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to lift them or search for the gate's hidden mechanism with a DC 15 Investigation check.
