She has been researching closely the events of the last fifty years, and is ready to put out the call for a group of adventurers to take on a dangerous mission...

### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  Players gather in Sharn and meet up.

 - [ ]  Enter Flamewind's Office, in Lareth Hall at Morgrave University.
>The heavy oaken door swings open, revealing a space shrouded in an air of profound wisdom and otherworldly allure. Sunlight filters through stained glass windows, casting a kaleidoscope of warm hues upon the richly decorated room. The chamber's interior is vast, yet every inch is meticulously adorned with scholarly trinkets and enigmatic artifacts.
>Bookshelves stretch from floor to ceiling, laden with tomes bearing scripts from distant lands and eras long past. Pulsating orbs of softly glowing magic hover in the air, casting a gentle luminescence that casts the room in an ethereal glow.
>The walls, lined with elaborate tapestries depicting strange symbols and celestial alignments, seem to whisper tales of forgotten prophecies and untold mysteries. A soothing fragrance of ancient incense lingers, weaving through the air and invoking a sense of tranquility and reverence.
>At the heart of the chamber rests a grand desk, a masterpiece crafted from rare woods and adorned with intricate carvings depicting celestial patterns. Scrolls and parchments, some unfurled and others meticulously rolled, are scattered across the desk's surface, each bearing cryptic runes or sketches of distant lands.
>A large, ornate mirror hangs prominently on one wall, framed in silver and etched with arcane symbols that seem to flicker and dance when observed closely. The mirror's surface holds a mesmerizing reflection, almost as if it beckons those who dare to seek answers from beyond the veil of time.
>In the center of the room, a majestic throne-like chair upholstered in velvet and embroidered with celestial motifs commands your attention. Seated upon the ornate chair is a regal figure, embodying an elegant fusion of leonine grace and elven ethereal allure, with orange and black striped fur and black falcon-like wings. Glittering golden eyes, reminiscent of ancient wisdom and timeless foresight, radiate a serene glow from beneath a crown-like silver diadem that adorns the brow.
>As your gaze meets hers, a gentle purr resonates in the air.

 - [ ]  Flamewind explains, cryptically, why she's asked the party here. She needs then to investigate the recent appearance of the sphinxes and the prevalence of the dragons. She gives them a 500 gp reward for answering her call.

 - [ ]  Flamewind directs the party to their first sphinx somewhere in Thrane (Tahorep). She also explains that she will give the party an additional 500 gp for every sphinx they discover and give her information on.

### Secrets and Clues
Check off as information is received. These should be gathered from Secrets and Clues in Characters and Locations above, as well as anything particular to the Scenes and Situations in this adventure.

 - [ ]  No dragonmarks have ever appeared on the people of Sarlona, and this reflects Sarlona's total absence from the Draconic Prophecy.
 - [ ]  The dragons of Argonnesson have been utterly unwilling to speak of Sarlona, which is why Flamewind is so interested in people from Sarlona pursuing these missions for her.
 - [ ]  The sphinxes are the only ones powerful enough to take on the dragons, but they don't like to get involved.
 - [ ]  The other sphinxes are scattered all around Eberron and will need to be tracked down and convinced to help. She doesn't know where to find all of them, but Tahorep, the sphinx of Thrane, is closest and should know more.
