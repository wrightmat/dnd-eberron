### Scenes and Situations

 - [ ]  The nearby town of Athandra.
	Has only basic services such as a small shop. The shopkeeper, a human woman named Nila, is a different age every time the players enter the shop. But Nila herself doesn't seem to notice. She sells an ancient lantern that she claims can be used to track down magical creatures.

 - [ ]  Finding the temple.
	Two successful Survival or Arcana checks, made with advantage if using the lantern, must be made to find the temple. Failure results in the party getting lost and ending up back in Athandra.

 - [ ]  Approaching the temple.
>Ahead, the landscape gradually transforms, betraying signs of an ancient civilization frozen in time. Massive sandstone pillars, weathered by the passage of countless ages, rise like silent sentinels, adorned with intricate hieroglyphs that tell tales of forgotten epochs. The very air seems to thicken with an enigmatic aura, carrying the whispers of bygone eras.
>The entrance to an underground temple stands before you, a colossal stone archway festooned with ornate carvings of celestial creatures and inscriptions in an ancient script that seems to beckon to the curious and the brave.
>As you draw nearer, the heat of the sun begins to wane, replaced by a cool, almost mystical breeze that carries hints of sandalwood and myrrh. The entrance, flanked by twin statues of sphinxes carved from solid granite, exudes an air of imposing grandeur.
>The colossal stone doors, weathered and adorned with faded pictorial reliefs depicting scenes of ancient Thrane and celestial guardians, stand slightly ajar, as if inviting those who dare to seek the hidden truths within.
>The rhythmic echoes of your footsteps on the sun-baked earth are soon engulfed by the solemn silence that envelops this sacred place. In the distance, the flickering light of torches illuminates the dim passage beyond, hinting at untold secrets and challenges waiting to be uncovered beneath the sands of time.

 - [ ]  Entrance Hall
>You enter a grand entrance hall with towering columns and intricate hieroglyphics on the walls, depicting the history of Thrane. A massive stone door on the far side of the room appears to have text written above it.
- **Riddle 1 (Entrance Riddle):** "I am a mystery that cannot be unraveled, a secret that cannot be revealed. What am I?" (Answer: a riddle). Answering the riddle correctly opens the door, leading onward.

 - [ ]  Hall of Trials
>You walk through a series of interconnected chambers with intricate murals depicting ancient sphinxes bestowing wisdom upon mortals. There are three doorways, each leading to a different room to the east, west, and north.
- **Combat Encounter:** The east and west rooms each contain two animated stone statues that come to life, wielding ancient weapons, representing a trial by combat to test the players' prowess. The room to the north continues on.

 - [ ]  Chamber of Reflection
>You come upon a serene room with a reflective pool at the center, surrounded by intricately designed mirrors that seem to reflect different versions of reality. The air is filled with a calming, mysterious aura. A stone pedestral near the pool appears to have writing on it.

- **Puzzle:** As the players step into the chamber, a set of riddles appear on a stone pedestal near the pool, with corresponding symbols etched into the mirrors around the room. The riddles read:
    - Riddle 1: "I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?" (Map)
    - Riddle 2: "The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?" (Footprints)
    - Riddle 3: "I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch will soon turn red. What am I?" (Fire)

- **Mechanics:** Each mirror has a specific symbol etched into it, corresponding to a potential answer for each riddle. When the players correctly answer a riddle, the corresponding symbol lights up in the mirror. However, if they answer incorrectly, a surge of magical energy is released, temporarily blinding and disorienting them. The pool's reflections change to provide hints or clues when the players are stuck, guiding them toward the correct answers.

The players must solve all three riddles correctly to unlock the hidden doorway, allowing them to proceed deeper into the lair.

 - [ ]  Library of Ages
>A vast chamber filled with shelves of ancient tomes and scrolls, containing knowledge about the history of Eberron and the enigmatic sphinxes. The room is dimly lit, and the air is heavy with the scent of ancient parchment.
- **Riddle 2 (Library Door Riddle):** "I am a silent guardian, full of stories untold. Those who seek my knowledge must decipher the ancient code. What am I?" (Answer: an ancient tome)

 - [ ]  Chamber of the Wise Guardian
>A large chamber with an elevated platform, where the a male Androsphinx resides. The creature has a regal demeanor, adorned with ancient symbols of wisdom and power.
