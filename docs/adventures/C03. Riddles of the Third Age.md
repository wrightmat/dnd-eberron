### Background

After Mother Night's plans with Dream and his portal to the past were foiled by a party of adventuring heroes (see [[C01. What Dreams May Come]]), she was forced to make other arrangements to destroy Eberron. Her new plan involves convincing the Dragons, the most powerful race on Eberron (but reluctant to use their power), that releasing Khyber (Tiamat) is actually a good thing that will lead to a new Eberron in which they will be the only ones in power. While this is technically true, and the Third Age of Eberron does belong to the Dragons, Mother Night only wants to advance the age in order to get closer to Eberron's complete destruction (foretold to happen at the end of the Third Age) and cares nothing for the Dragons.

Mother Night began communicating with a powerful Dragon named Arstyvrax, who had an open heart to Mother Night's ideas due to his ties to necromancy. She stoked the flames of hate in his heart and convinced him to take his Obsidian Dragons and attack Shae Mordai, the seat of the Undying Court in Aerenal. This attack, which occurred on 20 Barrakas 1002, was the first event in the Draconic Prophesy that is said to set in motion the eventual turning to the Third Age of Eberron.

Over the next half century across Eberron, all the clans of Dragons spread out, fueled by a new zeal from the Obsidian Dragon attack. Strangely though, the Obsidian Dragons themselves returned to Argonnessen and set up their base under The Vast, rarely to be seen again. Even more strangely, spottings of mysterious creatures known as sphinxes have been on the rise, especially on the newly liberated continent of Sarlona.

These events have garnered the attention of the formerly only known sphinx in Eberron, a gynosphinx called Flamewind who resides in the city of Sharn. She has been researching closely the events of the last fifty years, and is ready to put out the call for a group of adventurers to take on a dangerous mission...

### Outline

The Dragons of Argonnessen have become a regular right throughout Eberron, including Khorvaire, ever since the Elven city of Shae Mordai mysteriously fell. No one can explain their sudden increased presence, but with the knowledge and riches they bring, no one is complaining!

Even stranger then the dragons is the sudden surge is sightings of mysterious creatures known as Sphinxes. These events have garnered the attention of the formerly only known sphinx in Eberron, a gynosphinx called Flamewind who resides in the city of Sharn. She has been researching closely the events of the last fifty years, and is ready to put out the call for a group of adventurers to take on a dangerous mission...

This campaign will revolve around exploring underground temples, ruins, etc. and gathering information from Sphinxes who hide behind riddles. Eventually, the party could learn enough to take on the Dragons and/or stop their plan to free Khyber. Since Sphinxes have powerful magic, including time travel, they might be the only ones powerful enough to take on the Dragons. Could also be fun to introduce a Steel Dragon as a ally later in the campaign (could've secretly been an NPC they've met along the way). https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/ljo43s/steel_dragon_statistics_for_5e/

**BBEG**:: Arstyvrax, or Khyber (Tiamat) herself

### Locations

#### [[Sarlona]]

This is the primary location for the campaign, with the majority of the Sphinxes residing here. After the turning of the age on Dal Quor in 1000 YK, the Unity of Reidra fell and the continent of Sarlona resorted back to its former ten nations.

#### [[Xen’drik]]

The former continent of the giants is still mostly abandoned. The Dragons generally avoid this continent due to their history with the Giants there. Flamewind is known to have originally come from Xen'drik and it's theorized that her lair still exists there somewhere.

#### [[Aerenal]]

The elves are still the primarily occupants of this continent, although in much lower numbers after the Obsidian Dragon attack. The Copper Dragons, who already had a small outpost in the Madwood, have expanded out across much of Aerenal and even into Khorvaire and Sarlona via their commercial enterprise of the Copper Dragon Inns (many just being taken over Gold Dragon Inns).

#### [[Argonnessen]]

The gem dragons rule over all the other dragons from this island, but will occasionally (although rarely) interfere with the events of the other continents and races. The Amethyst Dragons head up the Scions of Sardior who control the continent, and have laid claim to the plains and other lands of the continent, while the Crystal Dragons have claimed the skies, and the Obsidian dragons have sheltered themselves underground.

#### [[Khorvaire]]

The Chromatic and Metallic Dragons are exerting their influence over various regions of Khorvaire, and a number of different clans clash over areas of the continent.

##### Northwest (Everice)
The frigid islands off the coast of the main continent are ruled over by the White Dragons and primarily populated by Giants.

##### Northwest (Eldeen Reaches)
The area northwest of Lake Galifar (now Emerald Lake) is ruled over by the Green Dragons and primarily populated by Elves. The badlands in the northwest corner of the continent are mostly a no-man’s land between the Greens, Whites, and Blacks.

##### West (Shadow Marches, Droaam)
All areas between the Greywall Mountains / Silver Lake and the west coast of the continent is controlled by the Black Dragons and primarily populated by Orcs and Goblinoids.

##### Northeast (Lhazaar)
The chain of islands east of Hoarfrost Mountains are controlled by the Blue Dragons and primarily populated by Elves.

##### East (Mror Holds)
The large mountain ranges, and the lake between them (now Ruby Lake), on the eastern area of the continent are controlled by the Red Dragons and primarily populated by Dwarves.

##### Southeast (Q’Barra, Talenta)
The deep jungles of this peninsula are the ancestral home of the Dragonborn and Lizardfolk races, but isn’t currently controlled by any single type of dragon. The plains to the west have become a no-man’s land between the Blue, Red, and Bronze Dragons, as well as the unaffiliated “Scales”.

##### South (Valenar)
The region south of Lake Cyre (Bronze Lake) is controlled by the Bronze Dragons and primarily populated by Halflings.

##### South (Darguun, Zilargo)
The Brass Dragons control this southern expanse of the continent, and is primarily populated by Gnomes.

##### Southwest (Sharn, Breland)
The area up and down the Dagger River, between the Greywall Mountains and the Howling Peaks, up to Silver Lake, is controlled by the Silver Dragons and primarily populated by Dragonborn and other Lizardfolk.

##### Central (Thrane)
The island of Thronehold, and the surrounding areas, are controlled by the Gold Dragons and their mostly Human subjects. The Dragons converted Galifar's old castle, which had been closed to the public for centuries, into a new golden wonder known as The Golden Palace. By opening it to the public, and allowing everyone to see the riches and power the Dragons possess, the Gold Dragons have been hoisted to the top of the societal hierarchy by the people of Khorvaire.

† Obsidian Gem Dragons are simply Topaz Gem Dragons (5e version from Fizban's) re-flavored as black instead (and without the Fabricate ability). Arstyvrax could use the Ancient Topaz Dragon or Adult Topaz Dragon (depending on desired CR) with the Vampire's additional Bite stuff, Charm action, and Vampire Weaknesses ability.

### Sphinxes

There are three types of Sphinxes: Prophetic Sphinxes, Time Traveling Sphinxes, and Story Sphinxes. Story Sphinxes are tied to Thelanis and are primarily agents of Destiny to keep the Book of Destiny's will on track. Time Traveling Sphinxes are tied to Kythri and are agents of the future civilization of Sphinxes that are trying to prevent their civilization from dying at the end of the Third Age of Eberron. Prophetic Sphinxes are tied to Xoriat and the Maze of Reality, and are agents of the Draconic Prophesy.

All of the Sphinxes are concerned about recent events because they advance the Age more quickly than it's supposed to go. The ways in which each group of Sphinxes tried to correct things may be different though.
