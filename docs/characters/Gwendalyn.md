Gender:: Female
Race:: Human
Occupation:: Druid Elder (Wardens of the Wood)
Class:: Druid (Circle of the Moon)
Originally an NPC played by Kerrie during [[3-03. The Orphanage Flashback]]

Gwendalyn was raised in an orphanage in Daskaran with several other orphans, where she had an adventure with a tiger at a young age. This led her to study the natural world, and druidic magic, at every opportunity she had. When she aged out of the system, she had nowhere to go, and decided to set out for the Eldeen Reaches - hoping to further her druidic studies.

Gwendalyn eventually found her way to Greenheart, the de facto capital of the Eldeen Reaches. Here she communed with the other druids and decided to be initiated into the Wardens of the Wood. Afterward, she was sent to smaller communities in the Reaches to continue her training - including Erlaskar (where she learned animal training and breeding from House Vadalis), Sylbaran (where she learned about the dangers of Droaam), Varna (where she learned about the broader world outside of the Reaches), and Wolf's Paw (where she befriended a community of shifters).

Gwendalyn is a Circle of the Moon Druid and her preferred wildshape is always a Tiger (CR 1).
