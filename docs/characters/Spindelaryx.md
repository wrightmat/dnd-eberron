Spindelaryx, also known by the nickname "Spiney", is a powerful dragon and secret leader of the Church of the Silver Flame in Thrane. In approximately 912 YK, Spindelaryx was left at an orphanage in Daskaran disguised as a white dragonborn, where she became fast friends with several of the orphans - but especially a young Aasimar named Onme.

Over the years, Spindelaryx advanced in the church, eventually receiving the rank of Knight Commander and command of the church's first spelljamming ship, and jewel of the Fleet of the Flame, Tira's Sacrifice. After several years of exploring wildspace with her crew, including her first mate Onme (who had just returned from her own first tour in "the up"), Spindelaryx returned to Flamekeep to great honors. She was promoted to the rank of Prefect and given domain over all of Thrane. Spindelaryx's first official act was to welcome an envoy of gold dragons from Argonnesson - which was quite the unusual thing in Thrane, even with the recent increased prevalence of dragons in other regions of Khorvaire.

Little did the Church know that Spindelaryx's ascension was the Chamber's plan all along. They had been the ones to plant Spindelaryx in Daskaran under complex disguising magic, and had been the ones pulling the strings behind the scenes, even with Spiney's relationship with Onme. Once Spindelaryx had control over Thrane, a sleeper signal that was part of the original spell went off - sending a message to the Chamber, and informing Spindelaryx of her true form as a gold dragon.

Now that Spindelaryx knew of her true identity, she knew she had one final job - to get her friend Onme at the very top of the Church. Her opportunity finally came in 1051 YK, when Jaela Daran passed away. Spindelaryx manipulated the Council of Cardinals and produced a "fateful event" that revealed Onme as a visionary to the Council. Now control of the Church was solely in the hands of Spindelaryx, and by proxy, the gold dragons of Argonnessen.
