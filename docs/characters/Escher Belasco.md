Escher Belasco is a flirtatious and enigmatic vampire spawn and former consort of Strahd von Zarovich. Originally from the Village of Barovia in the nation of Barovia, he resided in Castle Ravenloft for some time, until he came to Eberron.

In life Escher was a bard in a former adventuring party that was brought to Barovia to fight against Strahd von Zarovich. Before slaughtering the rest of the party, Strahd took a liking to the talented poet and musicianâ€™s wit and chose to keep him as a consort.

In conversation, Escher is clever and displays wit with a hint of melancholy. Although this melancholy has lifted considerably since he left Barovia, and the dread that Strahd was growing bored of him. On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a platinum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns. Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pendant.

After Strahd was killed by a group of adventurers brought together by fate (see [[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]), Escher decided to leave the realm, in search of new experiences and a way to become a vampire lord himself. He traveled to the former nation of Cyre on Eberron with two of the adventurers who were from there, and while they were appalled by the nature of the Mournland and decided to leave for another land, Escher was drawn to the mists that now surrounded the once great nation. He ended up wandering through the Mournland for many years, learning much about the strange creatures and dangerous survivors who now called it home. But eventually he made it through the mists and discovered a fortification known as Loom Keep where he settled.

Escher's only true goal was to gain power, and he made great progress when he met King Kaius ir'Wynarn III, who he immediately recognized as a vampire. But King Kaius didn't want his secret to get out, so he agreed to turn Escher into a true vampire in exchange for his silence. The King also gave Escher dominion over Loom Keep after he agreed to keep an eye on nearby Karrlakton, which was controlled by House Deneith instead of the Blood of Vol.

Escher can often be found visiting nearby Karrlakton to find new victims, but is careful not to interfere with or anger House Deneith (especially Baron Breven d'Deneith) while also keeping an eye on their activities. When not there, he will often explore The Nightwood, which he says reminds him of his home in Barovia.
