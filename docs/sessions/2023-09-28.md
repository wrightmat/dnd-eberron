[[13. Crya, the Lonely Dreamer]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Bad luck (disadvantage rolls called for at my discretion):
	* Onme: 4
	* Prism: 2
	* Windsor: 1


### Outline

 - [ ] Dream sends a wave of quori after the players when they arrive at the portal.

 - [ ] Fuse the dreamstone shards to close the portal (DC 15 Arcana, single action).

 - [ ] A few rounds into battle, Destiny arrives (descending from the sky with book in hand) and takes Dream aside to have a conversation. This can happen earlier if the players try to interfere with him rather than taking on the quori.
	 - "The smell of dust and libraries overwhelms your nostrils, as a tall man in a hooded cloak descends from the sky, a large leather-bound book chained to his arm."

 - [ ] After the battle has ended, Dream can be seen walking back toward his tower, and Destiny can explain himself.
	 - Destiny is usually more of an observer to reality (through the pages of his book). Occasionally, he is a more active participant in his book's narration. When this happens, it is generally because the book calls for his involvement to set up a series of events that will follow.
	 - Dream can sometimes get.... ambitious, and therefore he was directed by the book long ago to create and distribute the dreamstone shards as a means to subvert his plans should they arise. He cannot directly harm a family member, so this contingency plan was created.
	 - Dream's story was somewhat foretold as well, even as an Endless. One of the ancient rules is that we cannot fall in love with a mortal, or their downfall is assured (referring to Nada and his reasoning for opening the portal).
	 - Destiny knew something was amiss when an unexpected object appeared in his Garden, which is what caused him to arrive to investigate further (discovering the portal).
	 - He was not involved in your obtaining of the dreamstone shards - it was always written that heroes would arrive to address Dream's ambitions. And you made choices to arrive at that result.

 - [ ] The players may decide to go visit Dream and have a conversation. He will clarify anything the players desire, and may even still be convinced to turn the age. From his perspective, he was convinced of this plan by his Mother, who seemed quite insistent that he should try to make changes to the timeline (suggesting that she might have her own plan).

 - [ ] Destiny assists the PCs to each "start their next chapter". He is all-powerful, so this could be returning PCs to Eberron, granting a single use of the *wish* spell, or something else entirely. This leads to the epilogue of each player and the end of the campaign.
	- Destiny cannot interfere with the events of others, so he can't change anything on Eberron or elsewhere. But the PC's stories are incomplete, so he can assist them in whatever individual choices they'd like to make.
	- Rida would like to spend her final days on the moon of Olarune, enjoying the natural beauty of the plane of Lamannia. She's finally ready to rest with her husband's spirit (since he died there, and she had mostly been avoiding it). Destiny can send her there, unless a PC offers to give her a ride or something.
	- Tavick would like to return to Eberron to become a priest of the Silver Flame (as Onme suggested). Destiny can send him (and whoever else would like to go) back to Eberron.

#### Closing

"Live out your stories, friends. And when your time has come, my sister will happily welcome you home."
And with that, Destiny closes his book.
The End.

#### Epilogues

Each PC gets time to dictate their characters' epilogue, ideally this takes the form of what they do over the next few days, the next few months, and then the next several years (or rest of their life). Below is final information that can be imparted for each of the characters.

##### Adara

- [ ] Delirium reaches out the Adara one final time. She is wandering the Maze of Reality, as she often does, but things are starting to look different. All the sudden there are a lot more of the draconic-looking rats with scales in the maze...

If Adara decides to return to the Rock of Bral (or anywhere outside of Eberron, or even decides to remain in wildspace):
 - [ ] Possibly due to spending so much time there, Adara is able to see through the silvery curtain and into the wildspace of Eberron (although no one else she talks to can see it). Over the final years of her life, she notices that the Outer Darkness (the void she had spend so much time in) seems to be expanding slowly...

##### Astra

If Astra succeeds in Turning the Age on Dal Quor:
 - [ ] A few years after the collapse of The Inspired (due to the death and rebirth of all quori), the Path of Light has become the dominant religion on Sarlona.

##### Onme

If Onme returns to Flamekeep:
- [ ] A shardjammer ship, based on the plans that Onme sent to the church, is being completed in Scion's Sound near Flamekeep. It's named Tira's Sacrifice, and it captained by Onme's old friend Spiney.
- [ ] Onme sponsors Tavick's application into the Psalm of the Flame Seminary in Flamekeep, testifying that he served under her and learned the basics of the faith sufficient to enter seminary upon his return. He takes to the structure of seminary well, and graduates in four years, joining the Order of Friars. Immediately after graduation, he's sent to help establish a new church in an abandoned fort in a remote area of Karrnath, based on a tip from a templar many years ago...

##### Prism

If Prism returns to Sharn (or likely anywhere on Khorvaire):
 - [ ] Violet Boromar has learned of your return to Khorvaire, and has made it her life mission to make your life miserable. She hasn't yet tracked down the rest of your friends, but as long as she knows the location of one the people who ruined her life, she's good.

If Prism decides to stay in wildspace:
 - [ ] Vakees, the dao smith who the party owed a favor to on Fernia, reaches out to the ship. He has a job he could use help on, and there's a lot of gold in it for a good rogue. Maybe other work could come your way too, if you play your cards right.

##### Windsor

If Windor returns to Arcanix or the academic life:
 - [ ] He spends some time studying the complexities of the draconic prophesy that he gathered in Ecatzin's chamber and on the Maze of Reality. His old boss Tanila even allows him to check out a few books from Arcanix's library (which she'd never allowed anyone to do before). Eventually Windsor is able to uncover a truth about the prophesy - that it documents the history and future of the different versions of Eberron. He deciphers that it's divided into three great chapters - the Chapter of Siberys tells of the previous age that belonged to the Gith (but destroyed by the daelkyr), the Chapter of Eberron tells of the current age that belongs to Man, and the Chapter of Khyber seems to even glimpse some information about the next age - that will belong to the Dragons.
 - [ ] Tanila also reluctantly showed Windsor the Gate of Xabra, a secret of the Arcane Congress that sits atop one of the residential towers. He was immediately able to recognize several of the symbols on the menhirs (standing stones) as belonging to each of the planes that he had visited. After months of trail and error with various combinations, Windsor was eventually able to map out sequences that open the gate to each of the planes, including Dal Quor.
