[[13. Crya, the Lonely Dreamer]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Bad luck (disadvantage rolls called for at my discretion):
	* Onme: 4
	* Prism: 2
	* Windsor: 1


### Outline

 - [ ] Dream sends a wave of quori after the players when they arrive at the portal.

 - [ ] Fuse the dreamstone shards to close the portal (DC 15 Arcana, single action).

 - [ ] A few rounds into battle, Destiny arrives (descending from the sky with book in hand) and takes Dream aside to have a conversation. This can happen earlier if the players try to interfere with him rather than taking on the quori.
	 - "The smell of dust and libraries overwhelms your nostrils, as a tall man in a hooded cloak descends from the sky, a large leather-bound book chained to his arm."

 - [ ] After the battle has ended, Dream can be seen walking back toward his tower, and Destiny can explain himself.
	 - Destiny is usually more of an observer to reality (through the pages of his book). Occasionally, he is a more active participant in his book's narration. When this happens, it is generally because the book calls for his involvement to set up a series of events that will follow.
	 - Dream can sometimes get.... ambitious, and therefore he was directed by the book long ago to create and distribute the dreamstone shards as a means to subvert his plans should they arise. He cannot directly harm a family member, so this contingency plan was created.
	 - Dream's story was somewhat foretold as well, even as an Endless. One of the ancient rules is that we cannot fall in love with a mortal, or their downfall is assured (referring to Nada and his reasoning for opening the portal).
	 - Destiny knew something was amiss when an unexpected object appeared in his Garden, which is what caused him to arrive to investigate further (discovering the portal).
	 - He was not involved in your obtainment of the dreamstone shards - it was always written that heroes would arrive to address Dream's ambitions. And you made choices to arrive at that result.

 - [ ] The players may decide to go visit Dream and have a conversation. He will clarify anything the players desire, and may even still be convinced to turn the age.

 - [ ] Destiny assists the PCs to each "start their next chapter". He is all-powerful, so this could be returning PCs to Eberron, granting a single use of the *wish* spell, or something else entirely. This leads to the epilogue of each player and the end of the campaign.
	- Destiny cannot interfere with the events of others, so he can't change anything on Eberron or elsewhere. But the PC's stories are incomplete, so he can assist them in whatever individual choices they'd like to make.
	- Rida would like to spend her final days on the moon of Olarune, enjoying the natural beauty of the plane of Lamannia. Destiny can send her there, unless a PC offers to give her a ride or something.
	- Tavick would like to return to Eberron to become a priest of the Silver Flame (as Onme suggested). Destiny can send him (and whoever else would like to go) back to Eberron.

##### Closing
"Live out your stories, friends. And when your time has come, my sister will happily welcome you home."
And with that, Destiny closes his book.
The End.
