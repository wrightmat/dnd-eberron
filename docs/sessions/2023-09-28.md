### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Outline
 - [ ] Dream sends a wave of quori after the players when they arrive at the portal.
 - [ ] Fuse the dreamstone shards to close the portal (DC 15 Arcana, single action).
 - [ ] A few rounds into battle, Destiny arrives (descending from the sky with book in hand) and takes Dream aside to have a conversation. This can happen earlier if the players try to interfere with him rather than taking on the quori.
 - [ ] After the battle has ended, Destiny can explain himself.
