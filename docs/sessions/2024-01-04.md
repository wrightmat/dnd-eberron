### Pre-Session Notes:
* Questions to answer for each vignette (related to the Second Sundering and the fallout):
	* As you can see in regime changes across the world, when you kick out a dictator you create a vacuumâ€¦ so what filled it in your region? In ridding Sarlona of the Inspired, did your region fall into civil war, famine, and plague, or did the people come together and create something better? (Pre-Second Sundering, the people of Riedra loved the Inspired, and the Inspired provided for their basic needs. They were denied many freedoms people of Khorvaire took for granted, but they largely didn't have to worry about crime, starvation, shelter, etc.)
	* The hanbalani alta that are dotted around Riedra were powered by the quori, so are now inactive. What happened to them in your region? Maybe they remain in a ruined state, or have been re-purposed for something else, or even your people have found a different way to power them and have created a use for them?
	* Without protections from the Riedra, the Inspired, or the hanbalani alta, how are people in your region dealing with extraplanar threats from the multitude of manifest and wild zones? Are your people in danger, or have they addressed those threats somehow?


### Post-Session Write-Up:
* Adar feeds (at least certain) criminals to the blue dragons that are prevalent in the area.
* Pyrine was the first to establish trade for food with other regions, starting with food to Ohr Kaluun.
* Buried statue unearthed by a small boy (Rask, who eventually became an archeologist) in Borunan leading to the eventual excavation of a buried city.
