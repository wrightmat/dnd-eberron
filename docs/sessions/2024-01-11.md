### Pre-Session Notes:
* Syrkarn Vignette (we follow on woman's day as she wakes up, visits her office in the government building of Nderitese, and teleports to the various regions of Sarlona for meetings with other ambassadors)
	* We open on a Srykarn citizen and ambassador to the other regions of Sarlona, an eneko female named Immasa. She has blue skin and white hair, and a fairly significant overbite, which betrays her "mongrel" half-giant and ogre ancestry.
	* Immasa wakes up, and dons her usual clothing and cloak — decorated with intricate red and black line-art patterns in a style reminiscent of the architecture of ancient Sarlona. She takes her time cooking a hearty breakfast of local meats and fruits, well spiced, and served with copious amounts of ustah — a potent liquor brewed from honey and wild berries.
	* After finishing breakfast, Immasa steps out of her hovel, an elaborate framework of interlocking poles and light beams over which decorated hides have been stretched and sealed. She walks away from her village, built on the central plazas of a ruined city that came before, via ancient avenues that radiate out through the surrounding grasslands, toward the capital of Nderitese.
	* Dominated by columns, straight lines, and square arches, the architecture of the capital city of Nderitese is a sight to behold. Wood and stone buildings, such as the large central government building that Immasa walks toward, are buttressed, arched, and reinforced to last a lifetime.
