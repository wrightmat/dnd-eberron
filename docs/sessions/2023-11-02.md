### Pre-Session Notes:

* Amber Temple / Tsolenka Pass
	* Potentially do the two pages of Tsolenka Pass (pg. 157) after the Amber Temple, if they get done early and there's time to fill. Replace both the Roc and Giant Goat with a Vrock (CR 6) and have it have same pelt benefit that the giant goat has. This could be especially helpful if the Amber Temple needs to be broken into two sessions, to fill out the second session so that we can start fresh with Castle Ravenloft.
	* Need to make Strahd's envy of/rivalry with Sergei clear so that they know to look for treasure in Sergei's tomb when they get back to Castle Ravenloft. This information should probably come from Exethanter.

### Post-Session Write-Up:
* Amber Temple was brutal! First TPK came from the arcanaloth and flameskulls on the east side of the basement level, after Kasimir ran off. When they woke up in the catacombs, they saw Kasimir passed out in the distance. They woke him up and went with him to the room in the north.
* Atlas investigated the crates so they fought all six vampire spawns. Kasimir didn't help, and instead ran over to the sarcophagus and got his dark gift, then misty stepped up the stairs. Second TPK, and the party woke up in the catacombs again. They headed upstairs where they discovered a bunch of dead vampire spawn, and Kasimir running off in the distance (after failing to be stopped by a hold person spell).
* They also met Exethanter, who didn't know that was his name and told them the stories he had read about a lich named Exethanter who used to control the Temple, along with the history of the Temple he had read. They asked about Strahd and learned that he had come here to get his dark power and it's where he became a vampire.
* Atlas was friendliest with the lich, and he asked if he could return to the library for more knowledge. The lich agreed, if he would come back with a name for him. That night, Atlas communed with Elden who said that he would lift the lich's fog if Atlas completed his mission (killing Strahd).
* The group ate their dream pastries and saw crazy singing dream sequences of Escher, Sergei, and Strahd. Drugs are fun!
* Next time is Castle Ravenloft, and I made it clear that it's a real-time 3+ hour session.
