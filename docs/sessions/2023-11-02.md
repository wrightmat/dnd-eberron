### Pre-Session Notes:

* Amber Temple / Tsolenka Pass
	* Potentially do the two pages of Tsolenka Pass (pg. 157) after the Amber Temple, if they get done early and there's time to fill. Replace both the Roc and Giant Goat with a Vrock (CR 6) and have it have same pelt benefit that the giant goat has. This could be especially helpful if the Amber Temple needs to be broken into two sessions, to fill out the second session so that we can start fresh with Castle Ravenloft.
	* Need to make Strahd's envy of/rivalry with Sergei clear so that they know to look for treasure in Sergei's tomb when they get back to Castle Ravenloft. This information should probably come from Exethanter.
