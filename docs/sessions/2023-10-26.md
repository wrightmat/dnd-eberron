### Pre-Session Notes:

* Yester Hill (pg. 197)
	* `encounter: 1: Tree Blight`
	* `encounter: 3: Vine Blight, 6: Needle Blight, 12: Twig Blight`
	* `encounter: 6: Druid, 6: Berserker`
	* Give players Perception/Investigation checks to discover the glowing pinecone shaped gem in the wooden statue. If they disturb the statue though, the Gulthias tree (tree blight) should attack, and it can move 30 feet per round.
	* The Tome of Strahd lies at the base of the Gulthias tree (chapter 14, area Y4). Any wereraven encountered in the wilderness can lead the characters to the location.
* When the players return to Vallaki with the wine, have them intercepted by Kasimir Velikov outside of town, who is leaving (for the Amber Temple) to investigate the dreams that have been troubling him recently about his dead sister. Luna Rose should at least be tempted to help or accompany him, since they have a connection.
* Alternatively/additionally, if the players sleep somewhere prior to returning to Vallaki, have Elden reach out to Atlas. "Knowledge of great evil is hidden in a temple in the mountains of snow. Extreme cold keeps interlopers away." (Mount Ghakis)
* Amber Temple / Tsolenka Pass
	* Potentially do the two pages of Tsolenka Pass (pg. 157) after the Amber Temple, if they get done early and there's time to fill. Replace both the Roc and Giant Goat with a Vrock (CR 6) and have it have same pelt benefit that the giant goat has.
	* Need to make Strahd's envy of/rivalry with Sergei clear so that they know to look for treasure in Sergei's tomb when they get back to Castle Ravenloft.
