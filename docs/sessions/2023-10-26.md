### Pre-Session Notes:

* Yester Hill (pg. 197)
	* `encounter: 1: Tree Blight`
	* `encounter: 1: Vine Blight, 1: Needle Blight, 1: Twig Blight` (Vine Blight: Swarm of 3, Needle Blight: Swarm of 6, Twig Blight: Swarm of 12)
	* `encounter: 6: Druid, 6: Berserker`
	* Give players Perception/Investigation checks to discover the glowing pinecone shaped gem in the wooden statue. If they disturb the statue though, the Druids and Berserkers will attack and also start their ritual chanting (with Strahd being seen arriving in the distance).
	* The Tome of Strahd lies at the base of the Gulthias tree (chapter 14, area Y4). Any wereraven encountered in the wilderness can lead the characters to the location.
	* In the case of a TPK, the players wake up a few hours later at the top of the Hill, and it's clear that the druid ritual was completed and the tree blight has made its way toward the Winery.
* When the players return to Vallaki with the wine, have them intercepted by Kasimir Velikov outside of town, who is leaving (for the Amber Temple) to investigate the dreams that have been troubling him recently about his dead sister. Luna Rose should at least be tempted to help or accompany him, since they have a connection.
* Alternatively/additionally, if the players sleep somewhere prior to returning to Vallaki, have Elden reach out to Atlas. "A hoard of forbidden knowledge awaits you in a temple among the winter mountains. Vestiges trapped in amber protect the secrets of dark powers." (Mount Ghakis)
