### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start with a scene of Strahd appearing in the graveyard, after the PCs have gone inside.
	* Ireena and Ismark decide to hang back, and ask for privacy from the party as they pay their last respects to their father.
	* Once the players go inside, the sky begins to turn dark and lightning and rain quickly fill the sky outside. The from around the Village creeps slowly closer to the graveyard and a dark figure appears inside of them.
	* They see a man in a dark cloak with bone white skin descend to the graveyard on the other side of the burgomaster's grave to Ismark and Ireena. The PCs can hear some pleasant conversation between the three that indicates that this man has arrived to pay his respects to the dead.
