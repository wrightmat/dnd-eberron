### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start with a scene of Strahd appearing in the graveyard, after the PCs have gone inside. A few times during the scene, have each player roll a Perception check, with a 12+ needed to even see anything, a 15+ gives them the gist of the conversation, and an 18+ giving some actual dialogue.
	* Ireena and Ismark decide to hang back, and ask for privacy from the party as they pay their last respects to their father.
	* Once the players go inside, the sky begins to turn dark and lightning and rain quickly fill the sky outside. The mists from around the Village creeps slowly closer to the graveyard and a dark figure appears inside of them.
	* They see a man in a dark cloak with bone white skin descend to the graveyard on the other side of the burgomaster's grave to Ismark and Ireena. The PCs can hear some pleasant conversation between the three that indicates that this man has arrived to pay his respects to the dead.
		* "I do not mean to interrupt. I am simply here to pay my respects to your father, and my loyal servant, the Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich. His passing is a great sadness to our beloved Barovia and it's people."
	* If the players try to intervene, have Donovan stop them and go outside instead (Strahd can also try to Charm anyone who insists on trying to go outside).
		* Donavich intervenes, raising a holy symbol and telling Strahd to "leave this holy place". Strahd tells him that his knowledge of vampires is impressive ("no doubt a lesson from dealing with your son?"), but he makes two mistakes. The first is that a holy symbol must be presented with conviction, which he sorely lacks, and that Strahd is not an ordinary vampire. He knocks the symbol to the ground.
	* Before leaving, Strahd turns directly to Ireena and offers her safety within Castle Ravenloft. She can come with him now, or arrive at any time in the future and will be welcomed (if she needs time to grieve).
* As the players leave the Village of Barovia, the party should witness the March of the Dead (page 48).
* On the road to Vallaki, the party should encounter Morgantha the Night Hag on her way back from the Village of Barovia.
	* She should communicate that Strahd comes to a place called Yester Hill on occasion to gaze upon an image of his ancestral home city in the fog, even though he knows it canâ€™t be real.
* Need to add a Scroll of Greater Restoration somewhere so they can cure Stella Wachter. Good locations could be the Cult Headquarters (N4T), the Storage Room (N4Q), Victor's Workroom (N3T), or the Secret Attic (N2Q)
