### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start with a scene of Strahd appearing in the graveyard, after the PCs have gone inside. A few times during the scene, have each player roll a Perception check, with a 12+ needed to even see anything, a 15+ gives them the gist of the conversation, and an 18+ giving some actual dialogue.
	* Ireena and Ismark decide to hang back, and ask for privacy from the party as they pay their last respects to their father.
	* Once the players go inside, the sky begins to turn dark and lightning and rain quickly fill the sky outside. The mists from around the Village creeps slowly closer to the graveyard and a dark figure appears inside of them.
	* They see a man in a dark cloak with bone white skin descend to the graveyard on the other side of the burgomaster's grave to Ismark and Ireena. The PCs can hear some pleasant conversation between the three that indicates that this man has arrived to pay his respects to the dead.
		* "I do not mean to interrupt. I am simply here to pay my respects to your father, and my loyal servant, the Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich. His passing is a great sadness to our beloved Barovia and it's people."
	* If the players try to intervene, have Donovan stop them and go outside instead (Strahd can also try to Charm anyone who insists on trying to go outside).
		* Donavich intervenes, raising a holy symbol and telling Strahd to "leave this holy place". Strahd tells him that his knowledge of vampires is impressive ("no doubt a lesson from dealing with your son?"), but he makes two mistakes. The first is that a holy symbol must be presented with conviction, which he sorely lacks, and that Strahd is not an ordinary vampire. He knocks the symbol to the ground.
	* Before leaving, Strahd turns directly to Ireena and offers her safety within Castle Ravenloft. She can come with him now, or arrive at any time in the future and will be welcomed (if she needs time to grieve).
* As the players leave the Village of Barovia, the party should witness the March of the Dead (page 48).
* On the road to Vallaki, the party should encounter Morgantha the Night Hag on her way back from the Village of Barovia.
	* She should communicate that Strahd comes to a place called Yester Hill on occasion to gaze upon an image of his ancestral home city in the fog, even though he knows it can’t be real.
* Need to add a Scroll of Greater Restoration somewhere so they can cure Stella Wachter. Good locations could be the Cult Headquarters (N4T), the Storage Room (N4Q), Victor's Workroom (N3T), or the Secret Attic (N2Q)

### Post-Session Write-Up:

* After experiencing Strahd in the graveyard, the March of Death, and meeting Morgantha, the group made their way to Vallaki. They settled in at the Blue Water Inn, and chatted mostly with a very drunk Nicholai Wachter, and less so with Rictavio (whose name they didn't get).
* They learned all about Stella Wachter and her mother (and everyone's attitudes toward Strahd), then Urwin gave them the quest to get wine from the Wizard of Wines.
* Everyone stayed the night at the Blue Water, after convincing Urwin to let them stay for free that night too (and get some free wine as an advance). Ireena stayed there as the rest of the group left Vallaki toward the winery. On the way, they encountered the Black Carriage and got their invite to dinner from Strahd.
* They decided to get in the Black Carriage and go ahead to dinner right away. Dinner went really well, and they got a little cryptic information from Strahd about his history (but nothing of interest because of bad checks). Willimond got charmed by Strahd, and the whole group decided to stay the night.
* Next time we'll start out with the group leaving the Castle in the morning. Will likely continue to the Wizard of Wines.
