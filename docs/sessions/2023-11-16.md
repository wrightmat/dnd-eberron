### Post-Session Write-Up:

The battle went on for a few more hours, with a few deaths and raising of the dead by Atlas. But eventually, Luna had the genius idea of turning into a water elemental and grappling Strahd, leeching away his last 20 hit points and dissolving him like acid, finally killing hiim.

In the epilogue, the group met Escher and Ireena on the overlook and got the final scene with Sergei and Ireena. After the mists lifted, Luna decided to stay in Barovia and return to the woods to partake in nature. The rest of them, along with Escher, loaded up in a Vistani wagon headed back to Cyre. When they got there, they realized everything they knew was gone. They tried to *speak with dead* on a corpse, who didn't really know what happened. Escher took to the area, and the familiar mists that now surrounded him, and decided to stay behind. The others loaded back into the wagon and set off for Atlas's homeland, where they settled down. A few weeks later, Atlas was whisked away to somewhere else! We returned to Luna a month or two later as the mists have started to creep back into the woods that surround her.

In the future, Escher could be used as an NPC in Eberron. After wandering the Mournland for some time, he would likely settle down in Karrnath eventually, becoming very powerful (maybe not quite vampire lord level, but probably as close as he could get).
