### Pre-Session Notes:

* Strahd can be found in Sergei's Tomb (K85) - "He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all." He is there because it's the anniversary of Sergei's death, and is paying his respects. He will not leave unless given a really good reason to do so.

### Post-Session Write-Up:
