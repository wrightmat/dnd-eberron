### Pre-Session Notes:

* Strahd can be found in the Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (K88). He is there because it's the anniversary of their death, and is paying his respects. He will not leave before the three hours is up, and is protected while inside by the Guardians. Once the three hours is up, Strahd will hunt down the party, or simply move to Sergei's Tomb (K85) if the party is already in the catacombs.
	*  "He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all."
