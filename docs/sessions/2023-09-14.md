[[13. Crya, the Lonely Dreamer]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Shard 6 obtained first. They succeeded in convincing Delirium to steal the shard from her Mother, and she barely pulled it off.
* Shard 10 (Adara's) obtained on the first night outside of Dal Quor on their way back.
* Shard 4 obtained when they returned to Emperor Cul'sir's throne room in the Giant's section of the Ocean of Dreams. They learned about a treasury that might have what they want from an elf guard. They had to fight a Fire Giant, but managed to grab the shard and get out of the dream.
* Shard 11 (Windsor's) obtained when they went back to the ship so Prism could sleep and heal. Windsor finds his while packing up his things to leave Sharn.
* Shard 8 obtained when Astra decided to return to the Archive of Dreams and get it from Ashana (where they left on better terms).
* Shard 12 (Astra's) 
* Shard 13 (Windsor)
