### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Shard 6 obtained first. They succeeded in convincing Delirium to steal the shard from her Mother, and she barely pulled it off.
* Shard 9 (Adara's) obtained on the first night outside of Dal Quor on their way back.
* Shard 4 obtained when they returned to Emperor Cul'sir's throne room in the Giant's section of the Ocean of Dreams. They learned about a treasury that might have what they want from an elf guard.
