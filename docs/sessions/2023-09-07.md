[[13. Crya, the Lonely Dreamer]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:

- Tried for Shard 4 first, in the Xen'drik region of the Ocean. Windsor swam in and touched a bubble, taking him back. But failed to learn anything.
- Shard 9 (Prism's) was obtained on their first night sleeping on Dal Quor, where she described a dream sequence where a bunch of mechanical Herengon dug up something from under their favorite tree.
- Shard 7 obtained from Death by returning to Dolurrh.
- Shard 2 obtained from The Architect on Kythri.
- Shard 1 obtained from the Whitepine Forest.
- Shard 3 obtained from the Quor-Toa, after trading for some almost equally shiny gems.
- Shard 5 obtained from the Dhakaani, as they entered their dream city and snatched it from a monastery (by Prism, while Windsor distracted the priests). 

Next time we'll flash back to Xoriat where the group (Adara) was going to try and convince Delirium to ask Mother for her shard.
