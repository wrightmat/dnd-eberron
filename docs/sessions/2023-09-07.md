### Pre-Session Notes:

### Post-Session Write-Up:

- Shard 4 first, in the Xen'drik region of the Ocean. Windsor swam in and touched a bubble, taking him back. But failed to learn anything.
- Prism's Shard 9 was found on their first night sleeping on Dal Quor, where she described a dream sequence where a bunch of mechanical herengon dug up something from under their favorite tree.
- Shard 7 obtained from Death by returning to Dolurrh.
