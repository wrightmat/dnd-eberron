[[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Return to the discussion that Atlas had with Escher in the lobby outside of their room. He would actually give him more information, but in a hushed, almost cryptic manner. "Many treasures lie within the crypts in the depths of the castle. But remember that Strahd has eyes everywhere."
* Wizard of Wines
	* `encounter: 5: Needle Blight` (6 waves)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 24: Twig Blight` (added wave 3)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 5: Needle Blight` (added wave 4)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 2: Vine Blight` (added wave 5)
	* Davian Martikov should direct the players to Yester Hill, but only after they have gained his trust (probably by clearing the Winery of bad guys). Only then does ‘he tell them that the vineyard’s three magic “seeds” have been stolen. He describes them as gems the size and shape of pinecones, each one containing a glowing green light as bright as a torch. For the good of all Barovia, he urges the characters to travel to Yester Hill (area Y) to retrieve the most recently stolen one. He is unsure where the other two went many years ago.
