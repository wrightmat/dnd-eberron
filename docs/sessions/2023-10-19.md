[[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Return to the discussion that Atlas had with Escher in the lobby outside of their room. He would actually give him more information, but in a hushed, almost cryptic manner. "Many treasures lie within the crypts in the depths of the castle. But remember that Strahd has eyes everywhere."
* Wizard of Wines (pg. 173)
	* `encounter: 5: Needle Blight` (6 waves)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 24: Twig Blight` (added wave 3)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 5: Needle Blight` (added wave 4)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 2: Vine Blight` (added wave 5)
	* Davian Martikov should direct the players to Yester Hill, but only after they have gained his trust (probably by clearing the Winery of bad guys). Only then does ‘he tell them that the vineyard’s three magic “seeds” have been stolen. He describes them as gems the size and shape of pinecones, each one containing a glowing green light as bright as a torch. For the good of all Barovia, he urges the characters to travel to Yester Hill (area Y) to retrieve the most recently stolen one. He is unsure where the other two went many years ago.
* Yester Hill (pg. 197)
	* `encounter: 1: Tree Blight`
	* `encounter: 3: Vine Blight, 6: Needle Blight, 12: Twig Blight`
	* `encounter: 6: Druid, 6: Berserker`
	* Give players Perception/Investigation checks to discover the glowing pinecone shaped gem in the wooden statue. If they disturb the statue though, the Gulthias tree (tree blight) should attack, and it can move 30 feet per round.
* When the players return to Vallaki with the wine, have them intercepted by Kasimir Velikov outside of town, who is leaving (for the Amber Temple) to investigate the dreams that have been troubling him recently about his dead sister. Luna Rose should at least be tempted to help or accompany him, since they have a connection.
