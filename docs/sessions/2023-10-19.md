[[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Return to the discussion that Atlas had with Escher in the lobby outside of their room. He would actually give him more information, but in a hushed, almost cryptic manner. "Many treasures lie within the crypts in the depths of the castle. But remember that Strahd has eyes everywhere."
* Wizard of Wines
	* `encounter: 5: Needle Blight` (6 waves)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 24: Twig Blight` (added wave 3)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 5: Needle Blight` (added wave 4)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 2: Vine Blight` (added wave 5)
