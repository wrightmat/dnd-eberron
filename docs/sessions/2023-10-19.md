[[C02. Curse of Strahd (Abridged)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:

* Return to the discussion that Atlas had with Escher in the lobby outside of their room. He would actually give him more information, but in a hushed, almost cryptic manner. "Many treasures lie within the crypts in the depths of the castle. But remember that Strahd has eyes everywhere."
* Wizard of Wines (pg. 173)
	* `encounter: 5: Needle Blight` (6 waves)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 1: Twig Blight` (swarm of 24) (added wave 3) - killed in W9
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 5: Needle Blight` (added wave 4) - killed in W13 (1 ran away)
	* `encounter: 1: Druid, 2: Vine Blight` (added wave 5) - killed in W20
	* Davian Martikov should direct the players to Yester Hill, but only after they have gained his trust (probably by clearing the Winery of bad guys). Only then does he tell them that the vineyard’s three magic “seeds” have been stolen. He describes them as "gems the size and shape of pinecones, each one containing a glowing green light as bright as a torch". For the good of all Barovia, he urges the characters to travel to Yester Hill (area Y) to retrieve the most recently stolen one. He is unsure where the other two went many years ago.
* Yester Hill (pg. 197)
	* `encounter: 1: Tree Blight`
	* `encounter: 3: Vine Blight, 6: Needle Blight, 12: Twig Blight`
	* `encounter: 6: Druid, 6: Berserker`
	* Give players Perception/Investigation checks to discover the glowing pinecone shaped gem in the wooden statue. If they disturb the statue though, the Gulthias tree (tree blight) should attack, and it can move 30 feet per round.
* When the players return to Vallaki with the wine, have them intercepted by Kasimir Velikov outside of town, who is leaving (for the Amber Temple) to investigate the dreams that have been troubling him recently about his dead sister. Luna Rose should at least be tempted to help or accompany him, since they have a connection.
* Alternatively/additionally, if the players sleep somewhere prior to returning to Vallaki, have Elden reach out to Atlas. "Knowledge of great evil is hidden in a temple in the mountains of snow. Extreme cold keeps interlopers away." (Mount Ghakis)
* Tsolenka Pass / Amber Temple
	* If they get this far, go ahead and do the two pages of Tsolenka Pass (pg. 157) prior to the Amber Temple. Replace both the Roc and Giant Goat with a Vrock (CR 6) and have it have same pelt benefit that the giant goat has.
